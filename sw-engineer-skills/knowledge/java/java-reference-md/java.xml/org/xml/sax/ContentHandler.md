---

public interface ContentHandler

Receive notification of the logical content of a document.

This is the main interface that most SAX applications
implement: if the application needs to be informed of basic parsing
events, it implements this interface and registers an instance with
the SAX parser using the [`setContentHandler`](XMLReader.md#setContentHandler(org.xml.sax.ContentHandler)) method. The parser uses the instance to report
basic document-related events like the start and end of elements
and character data.

The order of events in this interface is very important, and
mirrors the order of information in the document itself. For
example, all of an element's content (character data, processing
instructions, and/or subelements) will appear, in order, between
the startElement event and the corresponding endElement event.

This interface is similar to the now-deprecated SAX 1.0
DocumentHandler interface, but it adds support for Namespaces
and for reporting skipped entities (in non-validating XML
processors).

Implementors should note that there is also a
`ContentHandler` class in the `java.net`
package; that means that it's probably a bad idea to do

```
import java.net.*;
 import org.xml.sax.*;
```

In fact, "import ...\*" is usually a sign of sloppy programming
anyway, so the user should consider this a feature rather than a
bug.

* ## Method Details

  + ### setDocumentLocator

    void setDocumentLocator([Locator](Locator.md "interface in org.xml.sax") locator)

    Receive an object for locating the origin of SAX document events.

    SAX parsers are strongly encouraged (though not absolutely
    required) to supply a locator: if it does so, it must supply
    the locator to the application by invoking this method before
    invoking any of the other methods in the ContentHandler
    interface.

    The locator allows the application to determine the end
    position of any document-related event, even if the parser is
    not reporting an error. Typically, the application will
    use this information for reporting its own errors (such as
    character content that does not match an application's
    business rules). The information returned by the locator
    is probably not sufficient for use with a search engine.

    Note that the locator will return correct information only
    during the invocation SAX event callbacks after
    [`startDocument`](#startDocument()) returns and before
    [`endDocument`](#endDocument()) is called. The
    application should not attempt to use it at any other time.

    Parameters:
    :   `locator` - an object that can return the location of
        any SAX document event

    See Also:
    :   - [`Locator`](Locator.md "interface in org.xml.sax")
  + ### startDocument

    void startDocument()
    throws [SAXException](SAXException.md "class in org.xml.sax")

    Receive notification of the beginning of a document.

    The SAX parser will invoke this method only once, before any
    other event callbacks (except for [`setDocumentLocator`](#setDocumentLocator(org.xml.sax.Locator))).

    Throws:
    :   `SAXException` - any SAX exception, possibly
        wrapping another exception

    See Also:
    :   - [`endDocument()`](#endDocument())
  + ### declaration

    default void declaration([String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") version,
    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") encoding,
    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") standalone)
    throws [SAXException](SAXException.md "class in org.xml.sax")

    Receives notification of the XML declaration.

    Parameters:
    :   `version` - the version string as in the input document, null if not
        specified
    :   `encoding` - the encoding string as in the input document, null if not
        specified
    :   `standalone` - the standalone string as in the input document, null if
        not specified

    Throws:
    :   `SAXException` - if the application wants to report an error or
        interrupt the parsing process

    Since:
    :   14
  + ### endDocument

    void endDocument()
    throws [SAXException](SAXException.md "class in org.xml.sax")

    Receive notification of the end of a document.

    This method is invoked by the parser to signal it has reached the end of
    the document after successfully completing the parsing process.
    After the event, the parser will return the control to the application.

    Throws:
    :   `SAXException` - any SAX exception, possibly
        wrapping another exception

    See Also:
    :   - [`startDocument()`](#startDocument())
  + ### startPrefixMapping

    void startPrefixMapping([String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") prefix,
    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") uri)
    throws [SAXException](SAXException.md "class in org.xml.sax")

    Begin the scope of a prefix-URI Namespace mapping.

    The information from this event is not necessary for
    normal Namespace processing: the SAX XML reader will
    automatically replace prefixes for element and attribute
    names when the `http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces`
    feature is true (the default).

    There are cases, however, when applications need to
    use prefixes in character data or in attribute values,
    where they cannot safely be expanded automatically; the
    start/endPrefixMapping event supplies the information
    to the application to expand prefixes in those contexts
    itself, if necessary.

    Note that start/endPrefixMapping events are not
    guaranteed to be properly nested relative to each other:
    all startPrefixMapping events will occur immediately before the
    corresponding [`startElement`](#startElement(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String,org.xml.sax.Attributes)) event,
    and all [`endPrefixMapping`](#endPrefixMapping(java.lang.String))
    events will occur immediately after the corresponding
    [`endElement`](#endElement(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String)) event,
    but their order is not otherwise
    guaranteed.

    There should never be start/endPrefixMapping events for the
    "xml" prefix, since it is predeclared and immutable.

    Parameters:
    :   `prefix` - the Namespace prefix being declared.
        An empty string is used for the default element namespace,
        which has no prefix.
    :   `uri` - the Namespace URI the prefix is mapped to

    Throws:
    :   `SAXException` - the client may throw
        an exception during processing

    See Also:
    :   - [`endPrefixMapping(java.lang.String)`](#endPrefixMapping(java.lang.String))
        - [`startElement(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String, org.xml.sax.Attributes)`](#startElement(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String,org.xml.sax.Attributes))
  + ### endPrefixMapping

    void endPrefixMapping([String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") prefix)
    throws [SAXException](SAXException.md "class in org.xml.sax")

    End the scope of a prefix-URI mapping.

    See [`startPrefixMapping`](#startPrefixMapping(java.lang.String,java.lang.String)) for
    details. These events will always occur immediately after the
    corresponding [`endElement`](#endElement(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String)) event, but the order of
    [`endPrefixMapping`](#endPrefixMapping(java.lang.String)) events is not otherwise
    guaranteed.

    Parameters:
    :   `prefix` - the prefix that was being mapped.
        This is the empty string when a default mapping scope ends.

    Throws:
    :   `SAXException` - the client may throw
        an exception during processing

    See Also:
    :   - [`startPrefixMapping(java.lang.String, java.lang.String)`](#startPrefixMapping(java.lang.String,java.lang.String))
        - [`endElement(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String)`](#endElement(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String))
  + ### startElement

    void startElement([String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") uri,
    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") localName,
    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") qName,
    [Attributes](Attributes.md "interface in org.xml.sax") atts)
    throws [SAXException](SAXException.md "class in org.xml.sax")

    Receive notification of the beginning of an element.

    The Parser will invoke this method at the beginning of every
    element in the XML document; there will be a corresponding
    [`endElement`](#endElement(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String)) event for every startElement event
    (even when the element is empty). All of the element's content will be
    reported, in order, before the corresponding endElement
    event.

    This event allows up to three name components for each
    element:

    1. the Namespace URI;
    2. the local name; and
    3. the qualified (prefixed) name.

    Any or all of these may be provided, depending on the
    values of the http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces
    and the http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes
    properties:

    - the Namespace URI and local name are required when
      the namespaces property is true (the default), and are
      optional when the namespaces property is false (if one is
      specified, both must be);
    - the qualified name is required when the namespace-prefixes property
      is true, and is optional when the namespace-prefixes property
      is false (the default).

    Note that the attribute list provided will contain only
    attributes with explicit values (specified or defaulted):
    #IMPLIED attributes will be omitted. The attribute list
    will contain attributes used for Namespace declarations
    (xmlns\* attributes) only if the
    `http://xml.org/sax/features/namespace-prefixes`
    property is true (it is false by default, and support for a
    true value is optional).

    Like [`characters()`](#characters(char%5B%5D,int,int)), attribute values may have
    characters that need more than one `char` value.

    Parameters:
    :   `uri` - the Namespace URI, or the empty string if the
        element has no Namespace URI or if Namespace
        processing is not being performed
    :   `localName` - the local name (without prefix), or the
        empty string if Namespace processing is not being
        performed
    :   `qName` - the qualified name (with prefix), or the
        empty string if qualified names are not available
    :   `atts` - the attributes attached to the element. If
        there are no attributes, it shall be an empty
        Attributes object. The value of this object after
        startElement returns is undefined

    Throws:
    :   `SAXException` - any SAX exception, possibly
        wrapping another exception

    See Also:
    :   - [`endElement(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String)`](#endElement(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String))
        - [`Attributes`](Attributes.md "interface in org.xml.sax")
        - [`AttributesImpl`](helpers/AttributesImpl.md "class in org.xml.sax.helpers")
  + ### endElement

    void endElement([String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") uri,
    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") localName,
    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") qName)
    throws [SAXException](SAXException.md "class in org.xml.sax")

    Receive notification of the end of an element.

    The SAX parser will invoke this method at the end of every
    element in the XML document; there will be a corresponding
    [`startElement`](#startElement(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String,org.xml.sax.Attributes)) event for every endElement
    event (even when the element is empty).

    For information on the names, see startElement.

    Parameters:
    :   `uri` - the Namespace URI, or the empty string if the
        element has no Namespace URI or if Namespace
        processing is not being performed
    :   `localName` - the local name (without prefix), or the
        empty string if Namespace processing is not being
        performed
    :   `qName` - the qualified XML name (with prefix), or the
        empty string if qualified names are not available

    Throws:
    :   `SAXException` - any SAX exception, possibly
        wrapping another exception
  + ### characters

    void characters(char[] ch,
    int start,
    int length)
    throws [SAXException](SAXException.md "class in org.xml.sax")

    Receive notification of character data.

    The Parser will call this method to report each chunk of
    character data. SAX parsers may return all contiguous character
    data in a single chunk, or they may split it into several
    chunks; however, all of the characters in any single event
    must come from the same external entity so that the Locator
    provides useful information.

    The application must not attempt to read from the array
    outside of the specified range.

    Individual characters may consist of more than one Java
    `char` value. There are two important cases where this
    happens, because characters can't be represented in just sixteen bits.
    In one case, characters are represented in a *Surrogate Pair*,
    using two special Unicode values. Such characters are in the so-called
    "Astral Planes", with a code point above U+FFFF. A second case involves
    composite characters, such as a base character combining with one or
    more accent characters.

    Your code should not assume that algorithms using
    `char`-at-a-time idioms will be working in character
    units; in some cases they will split characters. This is relevant
    wherever XML permits arbitrary characters, such as attribute values,
    processing instruction data, and comments as well as in data reported
    from this method. It's also generally relevant whenever Java code
    manipulates internationalized text; the issue isn't unique to XML.

    Note that some parsers will report whitespace in element
    content using the [`ignorableWhitespace`](#ignorableWhitespace(char%5B%5D,int,int))
    method rather than this one (validating parsers *must*
    do so).

    Parameters:
    :   `ch` - the characters from the XML document
    :   `start` - the start position in the array
    :   `length` - the number of characters to read from the array

    Throws:
    :   `SAXException` - any SAX exception, possibly
        wrapping another exception

    See Also:
    :   - [`ignorableWhitespace(char[], int, int)`](#ignorableWhitespace(char%5B%5D,int,int))
        - [`Locator`](Locator.md "interface in org.xml.sax")
  + ### ignorableWhitespace

    void ignorableWhitespace(char[] ch,
    int start,
    int length)
    throws [SAXException](SAXException.md "class in org.xml.sax")

    Receive notification of ignorable whitespace in element content.

    Validating Parsers must use this method to report each chunk
    of whitespace in element content (see the W3C XML 1.0
    recommendation, section 2.10): non-validating parsers may also
    use this method if they are capable of parsing and using
    content models.

    SAX parsers may return all contiguous whitespace in a single
    chunk, or they may split it into several chunks; however, all of
    the characters in any single event must come from the same
    external entity, so that the Locator provides useful
    information.

    The application must not attempt to read from the array
    outside of the specified range.

    Parameters:
    :   `ch` - the characters from the XML document
    :   `start` - the start position in the array
    :   `length` - the number of characters to read from the array

    Throws:
    :   `SAXException` - any SAX exception, possibly
        wrapping another exception

    See Also:
    :   - [`characters(char[], int, int)`](#characters(char%5B%5D,int,int))
  + ### processingInstruction

    void processingInstruction([String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") target,
    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") data)
    throws [SAXException](SAXException.md "class in org.xml.sax")

    Receive notification of a processing instruction.

    The Parser will invoke this method once for each processing
    instruction found: note that processing instructions may occur
    before or after the main document element.

    A SAX parser must never report an XML declaration (XML 1.0,
    section 2.8) or a text declaration (XML 1.0, section 4.3.1)
    using this method.

    Like [`characters()`](#characters(char%5B%5D,int,int)), processing instruction
    data may have characters that need more than one `char`
    value.

    Parameters:
    :   `target` - the processing instruction target
    :   `data` - the processing instruction data, or null if
        none was supplied. The data does not include any
        whitespace separating it from the target

    Throws:
    :   `SAXException` - any SAX exception, possibly
        wrapping another exception
  + ### skippedEntity

    void skippedEntity([String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name)
    throws [SAXException](SAXException.md "class in org.xml.sax")

    Receive notification of a skipped entity.
    This is not called for entity references within markup constructs
    such as element start tags or markup declarations. (The XML
    recommendation requires reporting skipped external entities.
    SAX also reports internal entity expansion/non-expansion, except
    within markup constructs.)

    The Parser will invoke this method each time the entity is
    skipped. Non-validating processors may skip entities if they
    have not seen the declarations (because, for example, the
    entity was declared in an external DTD subset). All processors
    may skip external entities, depending on the values of the
    `http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities`
    and the
    `http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities`
    properties.

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - the name of the skipped entity. If it is a
        parameter entity, the name will begin with '%', and if
        it is the external DTD subset, it will be the string
        "[dtd]"

    Throws:
    :   `SAXException` - any SAX exception, possibly
        wrapping another exception
