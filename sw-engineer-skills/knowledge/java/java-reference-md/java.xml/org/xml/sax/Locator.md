public interface Locator

Interface for associating a SAX event with a document location.

If a SAX parser provides location information to the SAX
application, it does so by implementing this interface and then
passing an instance to the application using the content
handler's [`setDocumentLocator`](ContentHandler.md#setDocumentLocator(org.xml.sax.Locator)) method. The application can use the
object to obtain the location of any other SAX event
in the XML source document.

Note that the results returned by the object will be valid only
during the scope of each callback method: the application
will receive unpredictable results if it attempts to use the
locator at any other time, or after parsing completes.

SAX parsers are not required to supply a locator, but they are
very strongly encouraged to do so. If the parser supplies a
locator, it must do so before reporting any other document events.
If no locator has been set by the time the application receives
the [`startDocument`](ContentHandler.md#startDocument())
event, the application should assume that a locator is not
available.

Since:
:   1.4, SAX 1.0

  Modifier and Type

* ## Method Details

  + ### getPublicId

    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getPublicId()

    Return the public identifier for the current document event.

    The return value is the public identifier of the document
    entity or of the external parsed entity in which the markup
    triggering the event appears.

    Returns:
    :   A string containing the public identifier, or
        null if none is available.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getSystemId()`](#getSystemId())
  + ### getSystemId

    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getSystemId()

    Return the system identifier for the current document event.

    The return value is the system identifier of the document
    entity or of the external parsed entity in which the markup
    triggering the event appears.

    If the system identifier is a URL, the parser must resolve it
    fully before passing it to the application. For example, a file
    name must always be provided as a *file:...* URL, and other
    kinds of relative URI are also resolved against their bases.

    Returns:
    :   A string containing the system identifier, or null
        if none is available.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getPublicId()`](#getPublicId())
  + ### getLineNumber

    int getLineNumber()

    Return the line number where the current document event ends.
    Lines are delimited by line ends, which are defined in
    the XML specification.

    **Warning:** The return value from the method
    is intended only as an approximation for the sake of diagnostics;
    it is not intended to provide sufficient information
    to edit the character content of the original XML document.
    In some cases, these "line" numbers match what would be displayed
    as columns, and in others they may not match the source text
    due to internal entity expansion.

    The return value is an approximation of the line number
    in the document entity or external parsed entity where the
    markup triggering the event appears.

    If possible, the SAX driver should provide the line position
    of the first character after the text associated with the document
    event. The first line is line 1.

    Returns:
    :   The line number, or -1 if none is available.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getColumnNumber()`](#getColumnNumber())
  + ### getColumnNumber

    int getColumnNumber()

    Return the column number where the current document event ends.
    This is one-based number of Java `char` values since
    the last line end.

    **Warning:** The return value from the method
    is intended only as an approximation for the sake of diagnostics;
    it is not intended to provide sufficient information
    to edit the character content of the original XML document.
    For example, when lines contain combining character sequences, wide
    characters, surrogate pairs, or bi-directional text, the value may
    not correspond to the column in a text editor's display.

    The return value is an approximation of the column number
    in the document entity or external parsed entity where the
    markup triggering the event appears.

    If possible, the SAX driver should provide the line position
    of the first character after the text associated with the document
    event. The first column in each line is column 1.

    Returns:
    :   The column number, or -1 if none is available.
