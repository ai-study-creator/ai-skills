# Interface LSParser

---

public interface LSParser

An interface to an object that is able to build, or augment, a DOM tree
from various input sources.

`LSParser` provides an API for parsing XML and building the
corresponding DOM document structure. A `LSParser` instance
can be obtained by invoking the
`DOMImplementationLS.createLSParser()` method.

As specified in
[[DOM Level 3 Core](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407)]
, when a document is first made available via the LSParser:

* there will
  never be two adjacent nodes of type NODE\_TEXT, and there will never be
  empty text nodes.
* it is expected that the `value` and
  `nodeValue` attributes of an `Attr` node initially
  return the [XML 1.0
  normalized value](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204#AVNormalize). However, if the parameters
  "[validate-if-schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#parameter-validate-if-schema)" and
  "[datatype-normalization](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#parameter-datatype-normalization)"
  are set to `true`, depending on the attribute normalization
  used, the attribute values may differ from the ones obtained by the XML
  1.0 attribute normalization. If the parameters
  "[datatype-normalization](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#parameter-datatype-normalization)"
  is set to `false`, the XML 1.0 attribute normalization is
  guaranteed to occur, and if the attributes list does not contain
  namespace declarations, the `attributes` attribute on
  `Element` node represents the property **[attributes]** defined in
  [[XML Information Set](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-infoset-20040204/)].

Asynchronous `LSParser` objects are expected to also
implement the `events::EventTarget` interface so that event
listeners can be registered on asynchronous `LSParser`
objects.

Events supported by asynchronous `LSParser` objects are:

load
:   The `LSParser` finishes to load the document. See also the
    definition of the `LSLoadEvent` interface.

progress
:   The
    `LSParser` signals progress as data is parsed. This
    specification does not attempt to define exactly when progress events
    should be dispatched. That is intentionally left as
    implementation-dependent. Here is one example of how an application might
    dispatch progress events: Once the parser starts receiving data, a
    progress event is dispatched to indicate that the parsing starts. From
    there on, a progress event is dispatched for every 4096 bytes of data
    that is received and processed. This is only one example, though, and
    implementations can choose to dispatch progress events at any time while
    parsing, or not dispatch them at all. See also the definition of the
    `LSProgressEvent` interface.

**Note:** All events defined in this specification use the
namespace URI `"http://www.w3.org/2002/DOMLS"`.

While parsing an input source, errors are reported to the application
through the error handler (`LSParser.domConfig`'s
"[error-handler](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#parameter-error-handler)"
parameter). This specification does in no way try to define all possible
errors that can occur while parsing XML, or any other markup, but some
common error cases are defined. The types (`DOMError.type`) of
errors and warnings defined by this specification are:

`"check-character-normalization-failure" [error]`
:   Raised if the parameter
    "[check-character-normalization](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#parameter-check-character-normalization)"
    is set to true and a string is encountered that fails normalization
    checking.

`"doctype-not-allowed" [fatal]`
:   Raised if the
    configuration parameter "disallow-doctype" is set to `true`
    and a doctype is encountered.

`"no-input-specified" [fatal]`
:   Raised when loading a document and no input is specified in the
    `LSInput` object.

`"pi-base-uri-not-preserved" [warning]`
:   Raised if a processing
    instruction is encountered in a location where the base URI of the
    processing instruction can not be preserved. One example of a case where
    this warning will be raised is if the configuration parameter
    "[entities](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#parameter-entities)"
    is set to `false` and the following XML file is parsed:

    ```
     <!DOCTYPE root [ <!ENTITY e SYSTEM 'subdir/myentity.ent' ]>
     <root> &e; </root>
    ```

    And `subdir/myentity.ent`
    contains:

    ```
    <one> <two/> </one> <?pi 3.14159?>
     <more/>
    ```

`"unbound-prefix-in-entity" [warning]`
:   An
    implementation dependent warning that may be raised if the configuration parameter
    "[namespaces](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#parameter-namespaces)"
    is set to `true` and an unbound namespace prefix is
    encountered in an entity's replacement text. Raising this warning is not
    enforced since some existing parsers may not recognize unbound namespace
    prefixes in the replacement text of entities.

`"unknown-character-denormalization" [fatal]`
:   Raised if the
    configuration parameter "ignore-unknown-character-denormalizations" is
    set to `false` and a character is encountered for which the
    processor cannot determine the normalization properties.

`"unsupported-encoding" [fatal]`
:   Raised if an unsupported
    encoding is encountered.

`"unsupported-media-type" [fatal]`
:   Raised if the configuration parameter "supported-media-types-only" is set
    to `true` and an unsupported media type is encountered.

In addition to raising the defined errors and warnings, implementations
are expected to raise implementation specific errors and warnings for any
other error and warning cases such as IO errors (file not found,
permission denied,...), XML well-formedness errors, and so on.

* ## Method Details

  + ### getDomConfig

    [DOMConfiguration](../DOMConfiguration.md "interface in org.w3c.dom") getDomConfig()

    The `DOMConfiguration` object used when parsing an input
    source. This `DOMConfiguration` is specific to the parse
    operation. No parameter values from this `DOMConfiguration`
    object are passed automatically to the `DOMConfiguration`
    object on the `Document` that is created, or used, by the
    parse operation. The DOM application is responsible for passing any
    needed parameter values from this `DOMConfiguration`
    object to the `DOMConfiguration` object referenced by the
    `Document` object.
      
     In addition to the parameters recognized in on the
    [DOMConfiguration](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#DOMConfiguration)
    interface defined in
    [[DOM Level 3 Core](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407)]
    , the `DOMConfiguration` objects for `LSParser`
    add or modify the following parameters:

    `"charset-overrides-xml-encoding"`
    :   `true`
        :   [*optional*] (*default*) If a higher level protocol such as HTTP
            [[IETF RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)] provides an
            indication of the character encoding of the input stream being
            processed, that will override any encoding specified in the XML
            declaration or the Text declaration (see also section 4.3.3,
            "Character Encoding in Entities", in [[XML 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204)]).
            Explicitly setting an encoding in the `LSInput` overrides
            any encoding from the protocol.

        `false`
        :   [*required*] The parser ignores any character set encoding information from
            higher-level protocols.

    `"disallow-doctype"`
    :   `true`
        :   [*optional*] Throw a fatal **"doctype-not-allowed"** error
            if a doctype node is found while parsing the document. This is
            useful when dealing with things like SOAP envelopes where doctype
            nodes are not allowed.

        `false`
        :   [*required*] (*default*) Allow doctype nodes in the document.

    `"ignore-unknown-character-denormalizations"`
    :   `true`
        :   [*required*] (*default*) If, while verifying full normalization when
            [[XML 1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml11-20040204/)] is
            supported, a processor encounters characters for which it cannot
            determine the normalization properties, then the processor will
            ignore any possible denormalizations caused by these characters.
            This parameter is ignored for [[XML 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204)].

        `false`
        :   [*optional*] Report an fatal **"unknown-character-denormalization"**
            error if a character is encountered for which the processor cannot
            determine the normalization properties.

    `"infoset"`
    :   See
        the definition of `DOMConfiguration` for a description of
        this parameter. Unlike in [[DOM Level 3 Core](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407)]
        , this parameter will default to `true` for
        `LSParser`.

    `"namespaces"`
    :   `true`
        :   [*required*] (*default*) Perform the namespace processing as defined in
            [[XML Namespaces](http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xml-names-19990114/)]
            and [[XML Namespaces 1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-names11-20040204/)]
            .

        `false`
        :   [*optional*] Do not perform the namespace processing.

    `"resource-resolver"`
    :   [*required*] A reference to a `LSResourceResolver` object, or null. If
        the value of this parameter is not null when an external resource
        (such as an external XML entity or an XML schema location) is
        encountered, the implementation will request that the
        `LSResourceResolver` referenced in this parameter resolves
        the resource.

    `"supported-media-types-only"`
    :   `true`
        :   [*optional*] Check that the media type of the parsed resource is a supported media
            type. If an unsupported media type is encountered, a fatal error of
            type **"unsupported-media-type"** will be raised. The media types defined in
            [[IETF RFC 3023](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt)] must always
            be accepted.

        `false`
        :   [*required*] (*default*) Accept any media type.

    `"validate"`
    :   See the definition of
        `DOMConfiguration` for a description of this parameter.
        Unlike in [[DOM Level 3 Core](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407)]
        , the processing of the internal subset is always accomplished, even
        if this parameter is set to `false`.

    `"validate-if-schema"`
    :   See the definition of
        `DOMConfiguration` for a description of this parameter.
        Unlike in [[DOM Level 3 Core](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407)]
        , the processing of the internal subset is always accomplished, even
        if this parameter is set to `false`.

    `"well-formed"`
    :   See the definition of
        `DOMConfiguration` for a description of this parameter.
        Unlike in [[DOM Level 3 Core](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407)]
        , this parameter cannot be set to `false`.
  + ### getFilter

    [LSParserFilter](LSParserFilter.md "interface in org.w3c.dom.ls") getFilter()

    When a filter is provided, the implementation will call out to the
    filter as it is constructing the DOM tree structure. The filter can
    choose to remove elements from the document being constructed, or to
    terminate the parsing early.
      
     The filter is invoked after the operations requested by the
    `DOMConfiguration` parameters have been applied. For
    example, if "[validate](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#parameter-validate)"
    is set to `true`, the validation is done before invoking the
    filter.
  + ### setFilter

    void setFilter([LSParserFilter](LSParserFilter.md "interface in org.w3c.dom.ls") filter)

    When a filter is provided, the implementation will call out to the
    filter as it is constructing the DOM tree structure. The filter can
    choose to remove elements from the document being constructed, or to
    terminate the parsing early.
      
     The filter is invoked after the operations requested by the
    `DOMConfiguration` parameters have been applied. For
    example, if "[validate](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#parameter-validate)"
    is set to `true`, the validation is done before invoking the
    filter.
  + ### getAsync

    boolean getAsync()

    `true` if the `LSParser` is asynchronous,
    `false` if it is synchronous.
  + ### getBusy

    boolean getBusy()

    `true` if the `LSParser` is currently busy
    loading a document, otherwise `false`.
  + ### parse

    [Document](../Document.md "interface in org.w3c.dom") parse([LSInput](LSInput.md "interface in org.w3c.dom.ls") input)
    throws [DOMException](../DOMException.md "class in org.w3c.dom"),
    [LSException](LSException.md "class in org.w3c.dom.ls")

    Parse an XML document from a resource identified by a
    `LSInput`.

    Parameters:
    :   `input` - The `LSInput` from which the source of the
        document is to be read.

    Returns:
    :   If the `LSParser` is a synchronous
        `LSParser`, the newly created and populated
        `Document` is returned. If the `LSParser` is
        asynchronous, `null` is returned since the document
        object may not yet be constructed when this method returns.

    Throws:
    :   `DOMException` - INVALID\_STATE\_ERR: Raised if the `LSParser`'s
        `LSParser.busy` attribute is `true`.
    :   `LSException` - PARSE\_ERR: Raised if the `LSParser` was unable to load
        the XML document. DOM applications should attach a
        `DOMErrorHandler` using the parameter
        "[error-handler](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#parameter-error-handler)"
        if they wish to get details on the error.
  + ### parseURI

    [Document](../Document.md "interface in org.w3c.dom") parseURI([String](../../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") uri)
    throws [DOMException](../DOMException.md "class in org.w3c.dom"),
    [LSException](LSException.md "class in org.w3c.dom.ls")

    Parse an XML document from a location identified by a URI reference
    [[IETF RFC 2396](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt)]. If the URI
    contains a fragment identifier (see section 4.1 in
    [[IETF RFC 2396](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt)]), the
    behavior is not defined by this specification, future versions of
    this specification may define the behavior.

    Parameters:
    :   `uri` - The location of the XML document to be read.

    Returns:
    :   If the `LSParser` is a synchronous
        `LSParser`, the newly created and populated
        `Document` is returned, or `null` if an error
        occurred. If the `LSParser` is asynchronous,
        `null` is returned since the document object may not yet
        be constructed when this method returns.

    Throws:
    :   `DOMException` - INVALID\_STATE\_ERR: Raised if the `LSParser.busy`
        attribute is `true`.
    :   `LSException` - PARSE\_ERR: Raised if the `LSParser` was unable to load
        the XML document. DOM applications should attach a
        `DOMErrorHandler` using the parameter
        "[error-handler](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#parameter-error-handler)"
        if they wish to get details on the error.
  + ### parseWithContext

    [Node](../Node.md "interface in org.w3c.dom") parseWithContext([LSInput](LSInput.md "interface in org.w3c.dom.ls") input,
    [Node](../Node.md "interface in org.w3c.dom") contextArg,
    short action)
    throws [DOMException](../DOMException.md "class in org.w3c.dom"),
    [LSException](LSException.md "class in org.w3c.dom.ls")

    Parse an XML fragment from a resource identified by a
    `LSInput` and insert the content into an existing document
    at the position specified with the `context` and
    `action` arguments. When parsing the input stream, the
    context node (or its parent, depending on where the result will be
    inserted) is used for resolving unbound namespace prefixes. The
    context node's `ownerDocument` node (or the node itself if
    the node of type `DOCUMENT_NODE`) is used to resolve
    default attributes and entity references.
      
     As the new data is inserted into the document, at least one
    mutation event is fired per new immediate child or sibling of the
    context node.
      
     If the context node is a `Document` node and the action
    is `ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN`, then the document that is
    passed as the context node will be changed such that its
    `xmlEncoding`, `documentURI`,
    `xmlVersion`, `inputEncoding`,
    `xmlStandalone`, and all other such attributes are set to
    what they would be set to if the input source was parsed using
    `LSParser.parse()`.
      
     This method is always synchronous, even if the
    `LSParser` is asynchronous (`LSParser.async` is
    `true`).
      
     If an error occurs while parsing, the caller is notified through
    the `ErrorHandler` instance associated with the
    "[error-handler](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#parameter-error-handler)"
    parameter of the `DOMConfiguration`.
      
     When calling `parseWithContext`, the values of the
    following configuration parameters will be ignored and their default
    values will always be used instead:
    "[validate](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#parameter-validate)",
    "[validate-if-schema](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#parameter-validate-if-schema)",
    and
    "[element-content-whitespace](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#parameter-element-content-whitespace)".
    Other parameters will be treated normally, and the parser is expected
    to call the `LSParserFilter` just as if a whole document
    was parsed.

    Parameters:
    :   `input` - The `LSInput` from which the source document
        is to be read. The source document must be an XML fragment, i.e.
        anything except a complete XML document (except in the case where
        the context node of type `DOCUMENT_NODE`, and the action
        is `ACTION_REPLACE_CHILDREN`), a DOCTYPE (internal
        subset), entity declaration(s), notation declaration(s), or XML or
        text declaration(s).
    :   `contextArg` - The node that is used as the context for the data
        that is being parsed. This node must be a `Document`
        node, a `DocumentFragment` node, or a node of a type
        that is allowed as a child of an `Element` node, e.g. it
        cannot be an `Attribute` node.
    :   `action` - This parameter describes which action should be taken
        between the new set of nodes being inserted and the existing
        children of the context node. The set of possible actions is
        defined in `ACTION_TYPES` above.

    Returns:
    :   Return the node that is the result of the parse operation. If
        the result is more than one top-level node, the first one is
        returned.

    Throws:
    :   `DOMException` - HIERARCHY\_REQUEST\_ERR: Raised if the content cannot replace, be
        inserted before, after, or as a child of the context node (see also
        `Node.insertBefore` or `Node.replaceChild` in
        [[DOM Level 3 Core](http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407)]
        ).
          
         NOT\_SUPPORTED\_ERR: Raised if the `LSParser` doesn't
        support this method, or if the context node is of type
        `Document` and the DOM implementation doesn't support
        the replacement of the `DocumentType` child or
        `Element` child.
          
         NO\_MODIFICATION\_ALLOWED\_ERR: Raised if the context node is a
        read only node and the content is being appended to its child list,
        or if the parent node of the context node is read only node and the
        content is being inserted in its child list.
          
         INVALID\_STATE\_ERR: Raised if the `LSParser.busy`
        attribute is `true`.
    :   `LSException` - PARSE\_ERR: Raised if the `LSParser` was unable to load
        the XML fragment. DOM applications should attach a
        `DOMErrorHandler` using the parameter
        "[error-handler](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#parameter-error-handler)"
        if they wish to get details on the error.
  + ### abort

    void abort()

    Abort the loading of the document that is currently being loaded by
    the `LSParser`. If the `LSParser` is currently
    not busy, a call to this method does nothing.
