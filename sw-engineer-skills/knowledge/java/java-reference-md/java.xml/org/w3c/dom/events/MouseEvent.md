# Interface MouseEvent

All Superinterfaces:
:   `Event`, `UIEvent`

---

public interface MouseEvent
extends [UIEvent](UIEvent.md "interface in org.w3c.dom.events")

The `MouseEvent` interface provides specific contextual
information associated with Mouse events.

The `detail` attribute inherited from `UIEvent`
indicates the number of times a mouse button has been pressed and
released over the same screen location during a user action. The
attribute value is 1 when the user begins this action and increments by 1
for each full sequence of pressing and releasing. If the user moves the
mouse between the mousedown and mouseup the value will be set to 0,
indicating that no click is occurring.

In the case of nested elements mouse events are always targeted at the
most deeply nested element. Ancestors of the targeted element may use
bubbling to obtain notification of mouse events which occur within its
descendent elements.

  Method

  Description

  `boolean`

  `getAltKey()`

  Used to indicate whether the 'alt' key was depressed during the firing
  of the event.

  During mouse events caused by the depression or release of a mouse
  button, `button` is used to indicate which mouse button
  changed state.

  implementation's client area.

  of the event.

  `boolean`

  `getMetaKey()`

  Used to indicate whether the 'meta' key was depressed during the firing
  of the event.

  `EventTarget`

  `getRelatedTarget()`

  event.

  `int`

  `getScreenX()`

  The horizontal coordinate at which the event occurred relative to the
  origin of the screen coordinate system.

  `int`

  `getScreenY()`

  The vertical coordinate at which the event occurred relative to the
  origin of the screen coordinate system.

  `boolean`

  `getShiftKey()`

  Used to indicate whether the 'shift' key was depressed during the
  firing of the event.

  The `initMouseEvent` method is used to initialize the value
  of a `MouseEvent` created through the
  `DocumentEvent` interface.

* ## Method Details

  + ### getScreenX

    int getScreenX()

    The horizontal coordinate at which the event occurred relative to the
    origin of the screen coordinate system.
  + ### getScreenY

    int getScreenY()

    The vertical coordinate at which the event occurred relative to the
    origin of the screen coordinate system.
  + ### getClientX

    int getClientX()

    The horizontal coordinate at which the event occurred relative to the
    DOM implementation's client area.
  + ### getClientY

    int getClientY()

    The vertical coordinate at which the event occurred relative to the DOM
    implementation's client area.
  + ### getCtrlKey

    boolean getCtrlKey()

    Used to indicate whether the 'ctrl' key was depressed during the firing
    of the event.
  + ### getShiftKey

    boolean getShiftKey()

    Used to indicate whether the 'shift' key was depressed during the
    firing of the event.
  + ### getAltKey

    boolean getAltKey()

    Used to indicate whether the 'alt' key was depressed during the firing
    of the event. On some platforms this key may map to an alternative
    key name.
  + ### getMetaKey

    boolean getMetaKey()

    Used to indicate whether the 'meta' key was depressed during the firing
    of the event. On some platforms this key may map to an alternative
    key name.
  + ### getButton

    short getButton()

    During mouse events caused by the depression or release of a mouse
    button, `button` is used to indicate which mouse button
    changed state. The values for `button` range from zero to
    indicate the left button of the mouse, one to indicate the middle
    button if present, and two to indicate the right button. For mice
    configured for left handed use in which the button actions are
    reversed the values are instead read from right to left.
  + ### getRelatedTarget

    [EventTarget](EventTarget.md "interface in org.w3c.dom.events") getRelatedTarget()

    Used to identify a secondary `EventTarget` related to a UI
    event. Currently this attribute is used with the mouseover event to
    indicate the `EventTarget` which the pointing device
    exited and with the mouseout event to indicate the
    `EventTarget` which the pointing device entered.
  + ### initMouseEvent

    void initMouseEvent([String](../../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") typeArg,
    boolean canBubbleArg,
    boolean cancelableArg,
    [AbstractView](../views/AbstractView.md "interface in org.w3c.dom.views") viewArg,
    int detailArg,

    boolean metaKeyArg,
    short buttonArg,
    [EventTarget](EventTarget.md "interface in org.w3c.dom.events") relatedTargetArg)

    The `initMouseEvent` method is used to initialize the value
    of a `MouseEvent` created through the
    `DocumentEvent` interface. This method may only be called
    before the `MouseEvent` has been dispatched via the
    `dispatchEvent` method, though it may be called multiple
    times during that phase if necessary. If called multiple times, the
    final invocation takes precedence.

    Parameters:
    :   `typeArg` - Specifies the event type.
    :   `canBubbleArg` - Specifies whether or not the event can bubble.
    :   `cancelableArg` - Specifies whether or not the event's default
        action can be prevented.
    :   `viewArg` - Specifies the `Event`'s
        `AbstractView`.
    :   `detailArg` - Specifies the `Event`'s mouse click count.
    :   `screenXArg` - Specifies the `Event`'s screen x
        coordinate
    :   `screenYArg` - Specifies the `Event`'s screen y
        coordinate
    :   `clientXArg` - Specifies the `Event`'s client x
        coordinate
    :   `clientYArg` - Specifies the `Event`'s client y
        coordinate
    :   `ctrlKeyArg` - Specifies whether or not control key was depressed
        during the `Event`.
    :   `altKeyArg` - Specifies whether or not alt key was depressed during
        the `Event`.
    :   `shiftKeyArg` - Specifies whether or not shift key was depressed
        during the `Event`.
    :   `metaKeyArg` - Specifies whether or not meta key was depressed
        during the `Event`.
    :   `buttonArg` - Specifies the `Event`'s mouse button.
    :   `relatedTargetArg` - Specifies the `Event`'s related
        `EventTarget`.
