public class CatalogFeatures
extends [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

The CatalogFeatures holds a collection of features and properties.

Catalog Features

| Feature | Description | Property Name | System Property [1] | Value [2] | | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Type | Value |
| FILES | A semicolon-delimited list of URIs to locate the catalog files. The URIs must be absolute and have a URL protocol handler for the URI scheme. | javax.xml.catalog.files | javax.xml.catalog.files | String | URIs | Reads the first catalog as the current catalog; Loads others if no match is found in the current catalog including delegate catalogs if any. |
| PREFER | Indicates the preference between the public and system identifiers. The default value is public [3]. | javax.xml.catalog.prefer | N/A | String | `system` | Searches system entries for a match; Searches public entries when external identifier specifies only a public identifier |
| `public` | Searches system entries for a match; Searches public entries when there is no matching system entry. |
| DEFER | Indicates that the alternative catalogs including those specified in delegate entries or nextCatalog are not read until they are needed. The default value is true. | javax.xml.catalog.defer [4] | javax.xml.catalog.defer | String | `true` | Loads alternative catalogs as needed. |
| `false` | Loads all catalogs[5]. |
| RESOLVE | Determines the action if there is no matching entry found after all of the specified catalogs are exhausted. The default is strict. | javax.xml.catalog.resolve [4] | javax.xml.catalog.resolve | String | `strict` | Throws CatalogException if there is no match. |
| `continue` | Allows the XML parser to continue as if there is no match. |
| `ignore` | Tells the XML parser to skip the external references if there no match. |

**[1]** There is no System property for the features that marked as "N/A".

**[2]** The value shall be exactly as listed in this table, case-sensitive.
Any unspecified value will result in [`IllegalArgumentException`](../../../../java.base/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.md "class in java.lang").

**[3]** The Catalog specification defined complex rules on
[the prefer attribute](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/14809/xml-catalogs.html#attrib.prefer). Although the prefer can be public or system, the
specification actually made system the preferred option, that is, no matter
the option, a system entry is always used if found. Public entries are only
considered if the prefer is public and system entries are not found. It is
therefore recommended that the prefer attribute be set as public
(which is the default).

**[4]** Although non-standard attributes in the OASIS Catalog specification,
`defer` and `resolve` are recognized by the Java Catalog API the
same as the `prefer` as being an attribute in the catalog entry of the
main catalog. Note that only the attributes specified for the catalog entry
of the main Catalog file will be used.

**[5]** If the intention is to share an entire catalog store, it may be desirable to
set the property `javax.xml.catalog.defer` to false to allow the entire
catalog to be pre-loaded.

## Property Precedence

The Catalog Features follow the
[Property Precedence](../../../../java.xml/module-summary.md#PP)
as described in the module summary with regards to the priority with which
their values are retrieved from the various configuration sources such as the
[JAXP configuration file](../../../../java.xml/module-summary.md#Conf_CF),
system and API properties. In addition to the general configuration sources,
the Catalog Features are further supported in the catalog file itself where
they can be specified as attributes of the catalog and group entries. When the
attributes are specified, they shall take preference over any of the other
configuration sources.
For example, if a `prefer` attribute is set in the catalog file as in
`<catalog prefer="public">`, any other input for the "prefer" property
is not necessary or will be ignored.

A CatalogFeatures instance can be created through its builder as illustrated
in the following sample code:

```
                CatalogFeatures f = CatalogFeatures.builder()
                        .with(Feature.FILES, "file:///etc/xml/catalog")
                        .with(Feature.PREFER, "public")
                        .with(Feature.DEFER, "true")
                        .with(Feature.RESOLVE, "ignore")
                        .build();
```

## JAXP XML Processor Support

The Catalog Features are supported throughout the JAXP processors, including
SAX and DOM ([`javax.xml.parsers`](../parsers/package-summary.md)), and StAX parsers ([`javax.xml.stream`](../stream/package-summary.md)),
Schema Validation ([`javax.xml.validation`](../validation/package-summary.md)), and XML Transformation
([`javax.xml.transform`](../transform/package-summary.md)). The features described above can be set through JAXP
factories or processors that define a setProperty or setAttribute interface.
For example, the following code snippet sets a URI to a catalog file on a SAX
parser through the `javax.xml.catalog.files` property:

```
      SAXParserFactory spf = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
      spf.setFeature(XMLConstants.USE_CATALOG, true); [1]
      SAXParser parser = spf.newSAXParser();
      parser.setProperty(CatalogFeatures.Feature.FILES.getPropertyName(), "file:///etc/xml/catalog");
```

[1] Note that this statement is not required since the default value of
[`USE_CATALOG`](../XMLConstants.md#USE_CATALOG) is true.

The JAXP Processors' support for Catalog depends on both the
[`USE_CATALOG`](../XMLConstants.md#USE_CATALOG) feature and the
existence of valid Catalog file(s). A JAXP processor will use the Catalog
only when the feature is true and valid Catalog file(s) are specified through
the `javax.xml.catalog.files` property. It will make no attempt to use
the Catalog if either [`USE_CATALOG`](../XMLConstants.md#USE_CATALOG)
is set to false, or there is no Catalog file specified.

The JAXP processors will observe the default settings of the
[`CatalogFeatures`](CatalogFeatures.md "class in javax.xml.catalog"). The processors, for example, will
report an Exception by default when no matching entry is found since the
default value of the `javax.xml.catalog.resolve` property is strict.

The JAXP processors give preference to user-specified custom resolvers. If such
a resolver is registered, it will be used over the CatalogResolver. If it returns
null however, the processors will continue resolving with the CatalogResolver.
If it returns an empty source, no attempt will be made by the CatalogResolver.

The Catalog support is available for any process in the JAXP library that
supports a resolver. The following table lists all such processes.
