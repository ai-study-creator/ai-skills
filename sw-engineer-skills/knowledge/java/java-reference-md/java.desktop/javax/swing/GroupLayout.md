public class GroupLayout
extends [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [LayoutManager2](../../java/awt/LayoutManager2.md "interface in java.awt")

`GroupLayout` is a `LayoutManager` that hierarchically
groups components in order to position them in a `Container`.
`GroupLayout` is intended for use by builders, but may be
hand-coded as well.
Grouping is done by instances of the [`Group`](GroupLayout.Group.md "class in javax.swing") class. `GroupLayout` supports two types of groups. A sequential group
positions its child elements sequentially, one after another. A
parallel group aligns its child elements in one of four ways.

Each group may contain any number of elements, where an element is
a `Group`, `Component`, or gap. A gap can be thought
of as an invisible component with a minimum, preferred and maximum
size. In addition `GroupLayout` supports a preferred gap,
whose value comes from `LayoutStyle`.

Elements are similar to a spring. Each element has a range as
specified by a minimum, preferred and maximum. Gaps have either a
developer-specified range, or a range determined by `LayoutStyle`. The range for `Component`s is determined from
the `Component`'s `getMinimumSize`, `getPreferredSize` and `getMaximumSize` methods. In addition,
when adding `Component`s you may specify a particular range
to use instead of that from the component. The range for a `Group` is determined by the type of group. A `ParallelGroup`'s
range is the maximum of the ranges of its elements. A `SequentialGroup`'s range is the sum of the ranges of its elements.

`GroupLayout` treats each axis independently. That is, there
is a group representing the horizontal axis, and a group
representing the vertical axis. The horizontal group is
responsible for determining the minimum, preferred and maximum size
along the horizontal axis as well as setting the x and width of the
components contained in it. The vertical group is responsible for
determining the minimum, preferred and maximum size along the
vertical axis as well as setting the y and height of the
components contained in it. Each `Component` must exist in both
a horizontal and vertical group, otherwise an `IllegalStateException`
is thrown during layout, or when the minimum, preferred or
maximum size is requested.

The following diagram shows a sequential group along the horizontal
axis. The sequential group contains three components. A parallel group
was used along the vertical axis.

![Sequential group along the horizontal axis in three components](doc-files/groupLayout.1.gif)

To reinforce that each axis is treated independently the diagram shows
the range of each group and element along each axis. The
range of each component has been projected onto the axes,
and the groups are rendered in blue (horizontal) and red (vertical).
For readability there is a gap between each of the elements in the
sequential group.

The sequential group along the horizontal axis is rendered as a solid
blue line. Notice the sequential group is the sum of the children elements
it contains.

Along the vertical axis the parallel group is the maximum of the height
of each of the components. As all three components have the same height,
the parallel group has the same height.

The following diagram shows the same three components, but with the
parallel group along the horizontal axis and the sequential group along
the vertical axis.

![Sequential group along the vertical axis in three components](doc-files/groupLayout.2.gif)

As `c1` is the largest of the three components, the parallel
group is sized to `c1`. As `c2` and `c3` are smaller
than `c1` they are aligned based on the alignment specified
for the component (if specified) or the default alignment of the
parallel group. In the diagram `c2` and `c3` were created
with an alignment of `LEADING`. If the component orientation were
right-to-left then `c2` and `c3` would be positioned on
the opposite side.

The following diagram shows a sequential group along both the horizontal
and vertical axis.

![Sequential group along both the horizontal and vertical axis in three components](doc-files/groupLayout.3.gif)

`GroupLayout` provides the ability to insert gaps between
`Component`s. The size of the gap is determined by an
instance of `LayoutStyle`. This may be turned on using the
`setAutoCreateGaps` method. Similarly, you may use
the `setAutoCreateContainerGaps` method to insert gaps
between components that touch the edge of the parent container and the
container.

The following builds a panel consisting of two labels in
one column, followed by two textfields in the next column:

```
   JComponent panel = ...;
   GroupLayout layout = new GroupLayout(panel);
   panel.setLayout(layout);

   // Turn on automatically adding gaps between components
   layout.setAutoCreateGaps(true);

   // Turn on automatically creating gaps between components that touch
   // the edge of the container and the container.
   layout.setAutoCreateContainerGaps(true);

   // Create a sequential group for the horizontal axis.

   GroupLayout.SequentialGroup hGroup = layout.createSequentialGroup();

   // The sequential group in turn contains two parallel groups.
   // One parallel group contains the labels, the other the text fields.
   // Putting the labels in a parallel group along the horizontal axis
   // positions them at the same x location.
   //
   // Variable indentation is used to reinforce the level of grouping.
   hGroup.addGroup(layout.createParallelGroup().
            addComponent(label1).addComponent(label2));
   hGroup.addGroup(layout.createParallelGroup().
            addComponent(tf1).addComponent(tf2));
   layout.setHorizontalGroup(hGroup);

   // Create a sequential group for the vertical axis.
   GroupLayout.SequentialGroup vGroup = layout.createSequentialGroup();

   // The sequential group contains two parallel groups that align
   // the contents along the baseline. The first parallel group contains
   // the first label and text field, and the second parallel group contains
   // the second label and text field. By using a sequential group
   // the labels and text fields are positioned vertically after one another.
   vGroup.addGroup(layout.createParallelGroup(Alignment.BASELINE).
            addComponent(label1).addComponent(tf1));
   vGroup.addGroup(layout.createParallelGroup(Alignment.BASELINE).
            addComponent(label2).addComponent(tf2));
   layout.setVerticalGroup(vGroup);
```

When run the following is produced.

![Produced horizontal/vertical form](doc-files/groupLayout.example.png)

This layout consists of the following.

* The horizontal axis consists of a sequential group containing two
  parallel groups. The first parallel group contains the labels,
  and the second parallel group contains the text fields.* The vertical axis consists of a sequential group
    containing two parallel groups. The parallel groups are configured
    to align their components along the baseline. The first parallel
    group contains the first label and first text field, and
    the second group consists of the second label and second
    text field.

There are a couple of things to notice in this code:

* You need not explicitly add the components to the container; this
  is indirectly done by using one of the `add` methods of
  `Group`.* The various `add` methods return
    the caller. This allows for easy chaining of invocations. For
    example, `group.addComponent(label1).addComponent(label2);` is
    equivalent to
    `group.addComponent(label1); group.addComponent(label2);`.* There are no public constructors for `Group`s; instead
      use the create methods of `GroupLayout`.

    A value of `false` is useful when the visibility of components
    is dynamically adjusted and you don't want surrounding components and
    the sizing to change.

    The specified value is used for components that do not have an
    explicit visibility specified.

    boolean resizable)

    Creates and returns a `ParallelGroup` with the specified
    alignment and resize behavior. The `alignment` argument specifies how children elements are
    positioned that do not fill the group. For example, if a `ParallelGroup` with an alignment of `TRAILING` is given

    positioned at the position 50 (with a component orientation of
    left-to-right).

    Baseline alignment is only useful when used along the vertical
    axis. A `ParallelGroup` created with a baseline alignment
    along the horizontal axis is treated as `LEADING`.

    Notification that a `Component` has been added to
    the parent container. You should not invoke this method
    directly, instead you should use one of the `Group`
    methods to add a `Component`.

    Specified by:
    :   `addLayoutComponent` in interface `LayoutManager2`

    Parameters:
    :   `component` - the component added
    :   `constraints` - description of where to place the component

  + ### getLayoutAlignmentX

    public float getLayoutAlignmentX([Container](../../java/awt/Container.md "class in java.awt") parent)

    Returns the alignment along the x axis. This specifies how
    the component would like to be aligned relative to other
    components. The value should be a number between 0 and 1
    where 0 represents alignment along the origin, 1 is aligned
    the furthest away from the origin, 0.5 is centered, etc.

    Specified by:
    :   `getLayoutAlignmentX` in interface `LayoutManager2`

    Parameters:
    :   `parent` - the `Container` hosting this `LayoutManager`

    Returns:
    :   the alignment; this implementation returns `.5`

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `parent` is not
