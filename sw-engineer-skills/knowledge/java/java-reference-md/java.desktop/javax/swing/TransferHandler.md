# Class TransferHandler

[java.lang.Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

javax.swing.TransferHandler

All Implemented Interfaces:
:   `Serializable`

---

public class TransferHandler
extends [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Serializable](../../../java.base/java/io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io")

This class is used to handle the transfer of a `Transferable`
to and from Swing components. The `Transferable` is used to
represent data that is exchanged via a cut, copy, or paste
to/from a clipboard. It is also used in drag-and-drop operations
to represent a drag from a component, and a drop to a component.
Swing provides functionality that automatically supports cut, copy,
and paste keyboard bindings that use the functionality provided by
an implementation of this class. Swing also provides functionality
that automatically supports drag and drop that uses the functionality
provided by an implementation of this class. The Swing developer can
concentrate on specifying the semantics of a transfer primarily by setting
the `transferHandler` property on a Swing component.

This class is implemented to provide a default behavior of transferring
a component property simply by specifying the name of the property in
the constructor. For example, to transfer the foreground color from
one component to another either via the clipboard or a drag and drop operation
a `TransferHandler` can be constructed with the string "foreground". The
built in support will use the color returned by `getForeground` as the source
of the transfer, and `setForeground` for the target of a transfer.

    public TransferHandler([String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") property)

    Constructs a transfer handler that can transfer a Java Bean property
    from one component to another via the clipboard or a drag and drop
    operation.

    Parameters:
    :   `property` - the name of the property to transfer; this can
        be `null` if there is no property associated with the transfer
        handler (a subclass that performs some other kind of transfer, for example)
  + ### TransferHandler

    protected TransferHandler()

    Convenience constructor for subclasses.
* ## Method Details

  + ### getCutAction

    public static [Action](Action.md "interface in javax.swing") getCutAction()

    Returns an `Action` that performs cut operations to the
    clipboard. When performed, this action operates on the `JComponent`
    source of the `ActionEvent` by invoking `exportToClipboard`,
    with a `MOVE` action, on the component's `TransferHandler`.

    Returns:
    :   an `Action` for performing cuts to the clipboard
  + ### getCopyAction

    public static [Action](Action.md "interface in javax.swing") getCopyAction()

    Returns an `Action` that performs copy operations to the
    clipboard. When performed, this action operates on the `JComponent`
    source of the `ActionEvent` by invoking `exportToClipboard`,
    with a `COPY` action, on the component's `TransferHandler`.

    Returns:
    :   an `Action` for performing copies to the clipboard
  + ### getPasteAction

    public static [Action](Action.md "interface in javax.swing") getPasteAction()

    Returns an `Action` that performs paste operations from the
    clipboard. When performed, this action operates on the `JComponent`
    source of the `ActionEvent` by invoking `importData`,
    with the clipboard contents, on the component's `TransferHandler`.

    Returns:
    :   an `Action` for performing pastes from the clipboard
  + ### setDragImage

    public void setDragImage([Image](../../java/awt/Image.md "class in java.awt") img)

    Sets the drag image parameter. The image has to be prepared
    for rendering by the moment of the call. The image is stored
    by reference because of some performance reasons.

    Parameters:
    :   `img` - an image to drag
  + ### getDragImage

    public [Image](../../java/awt/Image.md "class in java.awt") getDragImage()

    Returns the drag image. If there is no image to drag,
    the returned value is `null`.

    Returns:
    :   the reference to the drag image
  + ### setDragImageOffset

    public void setDragImageOffset([Point](../../java/awt/Point.md "class in java.awt") p)

    Sets an anchor offset for the image to drag.
    It can not be `null`.

    Parameters:
    :   `p` - a `Point` object that corresponds
        to coordinates of an anchor offset of the image
        relative to the upper left corner of the image
  + ### getDragImageOffset

    public [Point](../../java/awt/Point.md "class in java.awt") getDragImageOffset()

    Returns an anchor offset for the image to drag.

    Returns:
    :   a `Point` object that corresponds
        to coordinates of an anchor offset of the image
        relative to the upper left corner of the image.
        The point `(0,0)` returns by default.
  + ### exportAsDrag

    public void exportAsDrag([JComponent](JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") comp,
    [InputEvent](../../java/awt/event/InputEvent.md "class in java.awt.event") e,
    int action)

    Causes the Swing drag support to be initiated. This is called by
    the various UI implementations in the `javax.swing.plaf.basic`
    package if the dragEnabled property is set on the component.
    This can be called by custom UI
    implementations to use the Swing drag support. This method can also be called
    by a Swing extension written as a subclass of `JComponent`
    to take advantage of the Swing drag support.

    The transfer *will not necessarily* have been completed at the
    return of this call (i.e. the call does not block waiting for the drop).
    The transfer will take place through the Swing implementation of the
    `java.awt.dnd` mechanism, requiring no further effort
    from the developer. The `exportDone` method will be called
    when the transfer has completed.

    Parameters:
    :   `comp` - the component holding the data to be transferred;
        provided to enable sharing of `TransferHandler`s
    :   `e` - the event that triggered the transfer
    :   `action` - the transfer action initially requested;
        either `COPY`, `MOVE` or `LINK`;
        the DnD system may change the action used during the
        course of the drag operation
  + ### exportToClipboard

    public void exportToClipboard([JComponent](JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") comp,
    [Clipboard](../../../java.datatransfer/java/awt/datatransfer/Clipboard.md "class in java.awt.datatransfer") clip,
    int action)
    throws [IllegalStateException](../../../java.base/java/lang/IllegalStateException.md "class in java.lang")

    Causes a transfer from the given component to the
    given clipboard. This method is called by the default cut and
    copy actions registered in a component's action map.

    The transfer will take place using the `java.awt.datatransfer`
    mechanism, requiring no further effort from the developer. Any data
    transfer *will* be complete and the `exportDone`
    method will be called with the action that occurred, before this method
    returns. Should the clipboard be unavailable when attempting to place
    data on it, the `IllegalStateException` thrown by
    [`Clipboard.setContents(Transferable, ClipboardOwner)`](../../../java.datatransfer/java/awt/datatransfer/Clipboard.md#setContents(java.awt.datatransfer.Transferable,java.awt.datatransfer.ClipboardOwner)) will
    be propagated through this method. However,
    `exportDone` will first be called with an action
    of `NONE` for consistency.

    Parameters:
    :   `comp` - the component holding the data to be transferred;
        provided to enable sharing of `TransferHandler`s
    :   `clip` - the clipboard to transfer the data into
    :   `action` - the transfer action requested; this should
        be a value of either `COPY` or `MOVE`;
        the operation performed is the intersection of the transfer
        capabilities given by getSourceActions and the requested action;
        the intersection may result in an action of `NONE`
        if the requested action isn't supported

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the clipboard is currently unavailable

    See Also:
    :   - [`Clipboard.setContents(Transferable, ClipboardOwner)`](../../../java.datatransfer/java/awt/datatransfer/Clipboard.md#setContents(java.awt.datatransfer.Transferable,java.awt.datatransfer.ClipboardOwner))
  + ### importData

    public boolean importData([TransferHandler.TransferSupport](TransferHandler.TransferSupport.md "class in javax.swing") support)

    Causes a transfer to occur from a clipboard or a drag and
    drop operation. The `Transferable` to be
    imported and the component to transfer to are contained
    within the `TransferSupport`.

    While the drag and drop implementation calls `canImport`
    to determine the suitability of a transfer before calling this
    method, the implementation of paste does not. As such, it cannot
    be assumed that the transfer is acceptable upon a call to
    this method for paste. It is recommended that `canImport` be
    explicitly called to cover this case.

    Note: The `TransferSupport` object passed to this method
    is only valid for the duration of the method call. It is undefined
    what values it may contain after this method returns.

    Parameters:
    :   `support` - the object containing the details of
        the transfer, not `null`.

    Returns:
    :   true if the data was inserted into the component,
        false otherwise

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `support` is `null`

    Since:
    :   1.6

    See Also:
    :   - [`canImport(TransferHandler.TransferSupport)`](#canImport(javax.swing.TransferHandler.TransferSupport))
  + ### importData

    public boolean importData([JComponent](JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") comp,
    [Transferable](../../../java.datatransfer/java/awt/datatransfer/Transferable.md "interface in java.awt.datatransfer") t)

    Causes a transfer to a component from a clipboard or a
    DND drop operation. The `Transferable` represents
    the data to be imported into the component.

    Note: Swing now calls the newer version of `importData`
    that takes a `TransferSupport`, which in turn calls this
    method (if the component in the `TransferSupport` is a
    `JComponent`). Developers are encouraged to call and override the
    newer version as it provides more information (and is the only
    version that supports use with a `TransferHandler` set directly
    on a `JFrame` or other non-`JComponent`).

    Parameters:
    :   `comp` - the component to receive the transfer;
        provided to enable sharing of `TransferHandler`s
    :   `t` - the data to import

    Returns:
    :   true if the data was inserted into the component, false otherwise

    See Also:
    :   - [`importData(TransferHandler.TransferSupport)`](#importData(javax.swing.TransferHandler.TransferSupport))
  + ### canImport

    public boolean canImport([TransferHandler.TransferSupport](TransferHandler.TransferSupport.md "class in javax.swing") support)

    This method is called repeatedly during a drag and drop operation
    to allow the developer to configure properties of, and to return
    the acceptability of transfers; with a return value of `true`
    indicating that the transfer represented by the given
    `TransferSupport` (which contains all of the details of the
    transfer) is acceptable at the current time, and a value of `false`
    rejecting the transfer.

    For those components that automatically display a drop location during
    drag and drop, accepting the transfer, by default, tells them to show
    the drop location. This can be changed by calling
    `setShowDropLocation` on the `TransferSupport`.

    By default, when the transfer is accepted, the chosen drop action is that
    picked by the user via their drag gesture. The developer can override
    this and choose a different action, from the supported source
    actions, by calling `setDropAction` on the `TransferSupport`.

    On every call to `canImport`, the `TransferSupport` contains
    fresh state. As such, any properties set on it must be set on every
    call. Upon a drop, `canImport` is called one final time before
    calling into `importData`. Any state set on the
    `TransferSupport` during that last call will be available in
    `importData`.

    This method is not called internally in response to paste operations.
    As such, it is recommended that implementations of `importData`
    explicitly call this method for such cases and that this method
    be prepared to return the suitability of paste operations as well.

    Note: The `TransferSupport` object passed to this method
    is only valid for the duration of the method call. It is undefined
    what values it may contain after this method returns.

    Parameters:
    :   `support` - the object containing the details of
        the transfer, not `null`.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the import can happen,
        `false` otherwise

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `support` is `null`

    Since:
    :   1.6

  + ### canImport

    public boolean canImport([JComponent](JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") comp,
    [DataFlavor](../../../java.datatransfer/java/awt/datatransfer/DataFlavor.md "class in java.awt.datatransfer")[] transferFlavors)

    Indicates whether a component will accept an import of the given
    set of data flavors prior to actually attempting to import it.

    Note: Swing now calls the newer version of `canImport`
    that takes a `TransferSupport`, which in turn calls this
    method (only if the component in the `TransferSupport` is a
    `JComponent`). Developers are encouraged to call and override the
    newer version as it provides more information (and is the only
    version that supports use with a `TransferHandler` set directly
    on a `JFrame` or other non-`JComponent`).

    Parameters:
    :   `comp` - the component to receive the transfer;
        provided to enable sharing of `TransferHandler`s
    :   `transferFlavors` - the data formats available

    Returns:
    :   true if the data can be inserted into the component, false otherwise

    See Also:
    :   - [`canImport(TransferHandler.TransferSupport)`](#canImport(javax.swing.TransferHandler.TransferSupport))
  + ### getSourceActions

    public int getSourceActions([JComponent](JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c)

    Returns the type of transfer actions supported by the source;
    any bitwise-OR combination of `COPY`, `MOVE`
    and `LINK`.

    Some models are not mutable, so a transfer operation of `MOVE`
    should not be advertised in that case. Returning `NONE`
    disables transfers from the component.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - the component holding the data to be transferred;
        provided to enable sharing of `TransferHandler`s

    Returns:
    :   `COPY` if the transfer property can be found,
        otherwise returns `NONE`
  + ### getVisualRepresentation

    public [Icon](Icon.md "interface in javax.swing") getVisualRepresentation([Transferable](../../../java.datatransfer/java/awt/datatransfer/Transferable.md "interface in java.awt.datatransfer") t)

    Returns an object that establishes the look of a transfer. This is
    useful for both providing feedback while performing a drag operation and for
    representing the transfer in a clipboard implementation that has a visual
    appearance. The implementation of the `Icon` interface should
    not alter the graphics clip or alpha level.
    The icon implementation need not be rectangular or paint all of the
    bounding rectangle and logic that calls the icons paint method should
    not assume the all bits are painted. `null` is a valid return value
    for this method and indicates there is no visual representation provided.
    In that case, the calling logic is free to represent the
    transferable however it wants.

    The default Swing logic will not do an alpha blended drag animation if
    the return is `null`.

    Parameters:
    :   `t` - the data to be transferred; this value is expected to have been
        created by the `createTransferable` method

    Returns:
    :   `null`, indicating
        there is no default visual representation
  + ### createTransferable

    protected [Transferable](../../../java.datatransfer/java/awt/datatransfer/Transferable.md "interface in java.awt.datatransfer") createTransferable([JComponent](JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c)

    Creates a `Transferable` to use as the source for
    a data transfer. Returns the representation of the data to
    be transferred, or `null` if the component's
    property is `null`

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - the component holding the data to be transferred;
        provided to enable sharing of `TransferHandler`s

    Returns:
    :   the representation of the data to be transferred, or
        `null` if the property associated with `c`
        is `null`
  + ### exportDone

    protected void exportDone([JComponent](JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") source,
    [Transferable](../../../java.datatransfer/java/awt/datatransfer/Transferable.md "interface in java.awt.datatransfer") data,
    int action)

    Invoked after data has been exported. This method should remove
    the data that was transferred if the action was `MOVE`.

    This method is implemented to do nothing since `MOVE`
    is not a supported action of this implementation
    (`getSourceActions` does not include `MOVE`).

    Parameters:
    :   `source` - the component that was the source of the data
    :   `data` - The data that was transferred or possibly null
        if the action is `NONE`.
    :   `action` - the actual action that was performed
