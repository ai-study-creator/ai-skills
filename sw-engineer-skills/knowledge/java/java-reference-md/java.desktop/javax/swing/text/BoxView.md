public class BoxView
extends [CompositeView](CompositeView.md "class in javax.swing.text")

A view that arranges its children into a box shape by tiling
its children along an axis. The box is somewhat like that
found in TeX where there is alignment of the
children, flexibility of the children is considered, etc.
This is a building block that might be useful to represent
things like a collection of lines, paragraphs,
lists, columns, pages, etc. The axis along which the children are tiled is
considered the major axis. The orthogonal axis is the minor axis.

Layout for each axis is handled separately by the methods
`layoutMajorAxis` and `layoutMinorAxis`.
Subclasses can change the layout algorithm by
reimplementing these methods. These methods will be called
as necessary depending upon whether or not there is cached
layout information and the cache is considered
valid. These methods are typically called if the given size
along the axis changes, or if `layoutChanged` is
called to force an updated layout. The `layoutChanged`
method invalidates cached layout information, if there is any.
The requirements published to the parent view are calculated by
the methods `calculateMajorAxisRequirements`
and `calculateMinorAxisRequirements`.
If the layout algorithm is changed, these methods will
likely need to be reimplemented.

    :   `axis` - either `View.X_AXIS` or `View.Y_AXIS`
* ## Method Details

  + ### getAxis

    public int getAxis()

    Fetches the tile axis property. This is the axis along which
    the child views are tiled.

    Returns:
    :   the major axis of the box, either
        `View.X_AXIS` or `View.Y_AXIS`

    Since:
    :   1.3
  + ### setAxis

    public void setAxis(int axis)

    Sets the tile axis property. This is the axis along which

    Since:
    :   1.3
  + ### layoutChanged

    public void layoutChanged(int axis)

    Invalidates the layout along an axis. This happens
    automatically if the preferences have changed for
    any of the child views. In some cases the layout
    may need to be recalculated when the preferences
    have not changed. The layout can be marked as
    invalid by calling this method. The layout will
    be updated the next time the `setSize` method
    is called on this view (typically in paint).

    Parameters:

    Since:
    :   1.3
  + ### isLayoutValid

    protected boolean isLayoutValid(int axis)

    Determines if the layout is valid along the given axis.

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - either `View.X_AXIS` or `View.Y_AXIS`

    Returns:

    that is all it does, but a subclass can use this to paint
    things relative to the child.

    Parameters:
    :   `g` - the graphics context
    :   `alloc` - the allocated region to paint into
    :   `index` - the child index, >= 0 && < getViewCount()

    int length,
    [View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text")[] elems)

    Invalidates the layout and resizes the cache of
    requests/allocations. The child allocations can still
    be accessed for the old layout, but the new children
    will have an offset and span of 0.

    Overrides:
    :   `replace` in class `CompositeView`

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - the starting index into the child views to insert
        the new views; this should be a value >= 0 and <= getViewCount
    :   `length` - the number of existing child views to remove;

    [ViewFactory](ViewFactory.md "interface in javax.swing.text") f)

    Forwards the given `DocumentEvent` to the child views
    that need to be notified of the change to the model.
    If a child changed its requirements and the allocation
    was valid prior to forwarding the portion of the box
    from the starting child to the end of the box will
    be repainted.

    Overrides:
    :   `forwardUpdate` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `ec` - changes to the element this view is responsible
        for (may be `null` if there were no changes)
    :   `e` - the change information from the associated document

    boolean width,
    boolean height)

    This is called by a child to indicate its

    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") allocation)

    Renders the `BoxView` using the given
    rendering surface and area
    on that surface. Only the children that intersect
    the clip bounds of the given `Graphics`
    will be rendered.

    otherwise the superclass behavior is executed.

    Overrides:
    :   `getChildAllocation` in class `CompositeView`

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - the index of the child, >= 0 && > getViewCount()
    :   `a` - the allocation to this view

    Returns:
    :   the allocation to the child; or `null`

  + ### layoutMajorAxis

    protected void layoutMajorAxis(int targetSpan,
    int axis,
    int[] offsets,
    int[] spans)

    Performs layout for the major axis of the box (i.e. the
    axis that it represents). The results of the layout (the
    offset and span for each children) are placed in the given
    arrays which represent the allocations to the children
    along the major axis.

    Parameters:
    :   `targetSpan` - the total span given to the view, which
        would be used to layout the children
    :   `axis` - the axis being laid out
    :   `offsets` - the offsets from the origin of the view for
        each of the child views; this is a return value and is
        filled in by the implementation of this method
    :   `spans` - the span of each child view; this is a return
        value and is filled in by the implementation of this method
  + ### layoutMinorAxis

    protected void layoutMinorAxis(int targetSpan,
    int axis,
    int[] offsets,
    int[] spans)

    Performs layout for the minor axis of the box (i.e. the
    axis orthogonal to the axis that it represents). The results
    of the layout (the offset and span for each children) are
    placed in the given arrays which represent the allocations to
    the children along the minor axis.

    Parameters:
    :   `targetSpan` - the total span given to the view, which
        would be used to layout the children
    :   `axis` - the axis being laid out
    :   `offsets` - the offsets from the origin of the view for
        each of the child views; this is a return value and is
        filled in by the implementation of this method
    :   `spans` - the span of each child view; this is a return
        value and is filled in by the implementation of this method

  + ### baselineLayout

    protected void baselineLayout(int targetSpan,
    int axis,
    int[] offsets,
    int[] spans)

    Computes the location and extent of each child view
    in this `BoxView` given the `targetSpan`,
    which is the width (or height) of the region we have to
    work with.

    Parameters:
    :   `targetSpan` - the total span given to the view, which
        would be used to layout the children
    :   `axis` - the axis being studied, either
        `View.X_AXIS` or `View.Y_AXIS`

        values specifying the location of each child view
    :   `spans` - an empty array filled by this method with
        values specifying the extent of each child view
  + ### baselineRequirements

    protected [SizeRequirements](../SizeRequirements.md "class in javax.swing") baselineRequirements(int axis,

    by examining the size of each child view.

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - the axis being studied

  + ### getOffset

    protected int getOffset(int axis,
    int childIndex)

    Fetches the offset of a particular child's current layout.

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - the axis being studied
    :   `childIndex` - the index of the requested child

    Returns:
    :   the offset (location) for the specified child
  + ### getSpan

  + ### flipEastAndWestAtEnds

    protected boolean flipEastAndWestAtEnds(int position,
    [Position.Bias](Position.Bias.md "class in javax.swing.text") bias)

    Determines in which direction the next view lays.
    Consider the View at index n. Typically the `View`s
    are laid out from left to right, so that the `View`
    to the EAST will be at index n + 1, and the `View`
    to the WEST will be at index n - 1. In certain situations,
    such as with bidirectional text, it is possible
    that the `View` to EAST is not at index n + 1,
    but rather at index n - 1, or that the `View`
    to the WEST is not at index n - 1, but index n + 1.
    In this case this method would return true,
    indicating the `View`s are laid out in
    descending order. Otherwise the method would return false
    indicating the `View`s are laid out in ascending order.

    If the receiver is laying its `View`s along the
    `Y_AXIS`, this will return the value from
    invoking the same method on the `View`
    responsible for rendering `position` and
    `bias`. Otherwise this will return false.

    Overrides:
    :   `flipEastAndWestAtEnds` in class `CompositeView`

    Parameters:
    :   `position` - position into the model
    :   `bias` - either `Position.Bias.Forward` or
        `Position.Bias.Backward`

    Returns:
    :   true if the `View`s surrounding the
        `View` responding for rendering
        `position` and `bias`
        are laid out in descending order; otherwise false
