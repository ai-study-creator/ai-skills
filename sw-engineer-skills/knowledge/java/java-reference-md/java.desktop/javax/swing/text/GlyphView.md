public class GlyphView
extends [View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text")
implements [TabableView](TabableView.md "interface in javax.swing.text"), [Cloneable](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Cloneable.md "interface in java.lang")

A GlyphView is a styled chunk of text that represents a view
mapped over an element in the text model. This view is generally
responsible for displaying text glyphs using character level
attributes in some way.
An implementation of the GlyphPainter class is used to do the
actual rendering and model/view translations. This separates
rendering from layout and management of the association with
the model.

The view supports breaking for the purpose of formatting.
The fragments produced by breaking share the view that has
primary responsibility for the element (i.e. they are nested
classes and carry only a small amount of state of their own)
so they can share its resources.

Since this view
represents text that may have tabs embedded in it, it implements the
`TabableView` interface. Tabs will only be
expanded if this view is embedded in a container that does
tab expansion. ParagraphView is an example of a container
that does tab expansion.

    [TabExpander](TabExpander.md "interface in javax.swing.text") e)

    Determines the desired span when using the given
    tab expansion implementation.

    Specified by:
    :   `getTabbedSpan` in interface `TabableView`

    Parameters:

  + ### getPartialSpan

    public float getPartialSpan(int p0,
    int p1)

    Determines the span along the same axis as tab
    expansion for a portion of the view. This is
    intended for use by the TabExpander for cases
    where the tab expansion involves aligning the
    portion of text that doesn't have whitespace
    relative to the tab stop. There is therefore
    an assumption that the range given does not
    contain tabs.

    This method can be called while servicing the
    getTabbedSpan or getPreferredSize. It has to
    arrange for its own text buffer to make the
    measurements.

    Specified by:
    :   `getPartialSpan` in interface `TabableView`

    Parameters:
    :   `p0` - the starting document offset >= 0

    :   `a` - the allocated region to render into
  + ### getMinimumSpan

    public float getMinimumSpan(int axis)

    Determines the minimum span for this view along an axis.

    This implementation returns the longest non-breakable area within
    the view as a minimum span for `View.X_AXIS`.

    Overrides:
    :   `getMinimumSpan` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - may be either `View.X_AXIS` or `View.Y_AXIS`

    Returns:
    :   the minimum span the view can be rendered into

    Returns:
    :   the span the view would like to be rendered into >= 0.
        Typically the view is told to render into the span
        that is returned, although there is no guarantee.
        The parent may choose to resize or break the view.
  + ### getAlignment

    public float getAlignment(int axis)

    Determines the desired alignment for this view along an
    axis. For the label, the alignment is along the font
    baseline for the y axis, and the superclasses alignment

    Overrides:
    :   `getAlignment` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - may be either View.X\_AXIS or View.Y\_AXIS

    Returns:
    :   the desired alignment. This should be a value
        between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive, where 0 indicates alignment at the
        origin and 1.0 indicates alignment to the full span
        away from the origin. An alignment of 0.5 would be the
        center of the view.
  + ### modelToView

    public [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") modelToView(int pos,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") a,
    [Position.Bias](Position.Bias.md "class in javax.swing.text") b)

    Parameters:
    :   `pos` - the position to convert >= 0
    :   `a` - the allocated region to render into
    :   `b` - either `Position.Bias.Forward`
        or `Position.Bias.Backward`

    Returns:
    :   the bounding box of the given position

    Throws:
    :   `BadLocationException` - if the given position does not represent a
        valid location in the associated document

    See Also:
    :   - [`View.modelToView(int, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.Position.Bias)`](View.md#modelToView(int,java.awt.Shape,javax.swing.text.Position.Bias))

    Provides a mapping from the view coordinate space to the logical
    coordinate space of the model.

    Specified by:
    :   `viewToModel` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `x` - the X coordinate >= 0
    :   `y` - the Y coordinate >= 0
    :   `a` - the allocated region to render into
    :   `biasReturn` - either `Position.Bias.Forward`
        or `Position.Bias.Backward` is returned as the
        zero-th element of this array

    Returns:
    :   the location within the model that best represents the
        given point of view >= 0

    See Also:
    :   - [`View.viewToModel(float, float, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.Position.Bias[])`](View.md#viewToModel(float,float,java.awt.Shape,javax.swing.text.Position.Bias%5B%5D))
  + ### getBreakWeight

    public int getBreakWeight(int axis,
    float pos,
    float len)

    Determines how attractive a break opportunity in
    this view is. This can be used for determining which
    view is the most attractive to call `breakView`
    on in the process of formatting. The
    higher the weight, the more attractive the break. A
    value equal to or lower than `View.BadBreakWeight`
    should not be considered for a break. A value greater
    than or equal to `View.ForcedBreakWeight` should
    be broken.

    This is implemented to forward to the superclass for
    the Y\_AXIS. Along the X\_AXIS the following values
    may be returned.

    **View.ExcellentBreakWeight**: if there is whitespace proceeding the desired break location. **View.BadBreakWeight**: if the desired break location results in a break location of the starting offset. **View.GoodBreakWeight**: if the other conditions don't occur.

    This will normally result in the behavior of breaking
    on a whitespace location if one can be found, otherwise
    breaking between characters.

    Overrides:
    :   `getBreakWeight` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - may be either View.X\_AXIS or View.Y\_AXIS
    :   `pos` - the potential location of the start of the
        broken view >= 0. This may be useful for calculating tab
        positions.
    :   `len` - specifies the relative length from *pos*
        where a potential break is desired >= 0.

    Returns:
    :   the weight, which should be a value between
        View.ForcedBreakWeight and View.BadBreakWeight.

  + ### breakView

    public [View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") breakView(int axis,
    int p0,
    float pos,
    float len)

    Breaks this view on the given axis at the given length.
    This is implemented to attempt to break on a whitespace
    location, and returns a fragment with the whitespace at
    the end. If a whitespace location can't be found, the
    nearest character is used.

    Overrides:
    :   `breakView` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - may be either View.X\_AXIS or View.Y\_AXIS
    :   `p0` - the location in the model where the
        fragment should start it's representation >= 0.
    :   `pos` - the position along the axis that the
        broken view would occupy >= 0. This may be useful for
        things like tab calculations.
    :   `len` - specifies the distance along the axis
        where a potential break is desired >= 0.

    Returns:
    :   the fragment of the view that represents the
        given span, if the view can be broken. If the view
        doesn't support breaking behavior, the view itself is
        returned.

    See Also:
    :   - [`View.breakView(int, int, float, float)`](View.md#breakView(int,int,float,float))
  + ### createFragment

    public [View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") createFragment(int p0,
    int p1)

    Creates a view that represents a portion of the element.
    This is potentially useful during formatting operations
    for taking measurements of fragments of the view. If
    the view doesn't support fragmenting (the default), it
    should return itself.

    This view does support fragmenting. It is implemented
    to return a nested class that shares state in this view
    representing only a portion of the view.

    Overrides:
    :   `createFragment` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `p0` - the starting offset >= 0. This should be a value
        greater or equal to the element starting offset and
        less than the element ending offset.
    :   `p1` - the ending offset > p0. This should be a value
        less than or equal to the elements end offset and
        greater than the elements starting offset.

    Returns:
    :   the view fragment, or itself if the view doesn't
        support breaking into fragments

    See Also:
    :   - [`LabelView`](LabelView.md "class in javax.swing.text")
  + ### getNextVisualPositionFrom

    public int getNextVisualPositionFrom(int pos,
    [Position.Bias](Position.Bias.md "class in javax.swing.text") b,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") a,
    int direction,
    [Position.Bias](Position.Bias.md "class in javax.swing.text")[] biasRet)
    throws [BadLocationException](BadLocationException.md "class in javax.swing.text")

    Provides a way to determine the next visually represented model
    location that one might place a caret. Some views may not be
    visible, they might not be in the same order found in the model, or
    they just might not allow access to some of the locations in the
    model.
    This method enables specifying a position to convert
    within the range of >=0. If the value is -1, a position
    will be calculated automatically. If the value < -1,
    the `BadLocationException` will be thrown.

    Overrides:
    :   `getNextVisualPositionFrom` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `pos` - the position to convert
    :   `b` - the bias
    :   `a` - the allocated region to render into
    :   `direction` - the direction from the current position that can
        be thought of as the arrow keys typically found on a keyboard.
        This may be SwingConstants.WEST, SwingConstants.EAST,
        SwingConstants.NORTH, or SwingConstants.SOUTH.
    :   `biasRet` - the returned bias

    Returns:
    :   the location within the model that best represents the next
        location visual position.

    Throws:
    :   `BadLocationException` - the given position is not a valid
        position within the document
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - for an invalid direction
  + ### insertUpdate

    public void insertUpdate([DocumentEvent](../event/DocumentEvent.md "interface in javax.swing.event") e,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") a,
    [ViewFactory](ViewFactory.md "interface in javax.swing.text") f)

    Gives notification that something was inserted into
