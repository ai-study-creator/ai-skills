javax.swing.text.AsyncBoxView

All Implemented Interfaces:
:   `SwingConstants`

---

public class AsyncBoxView
extends [View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text")

A box that does layout asynchronously. This
is useful to keep the GUI event thread moving by
not doing any layout on it. The layout is done
on a granularity of operations on the child views.
After each child view is accessed for some part
of layout (a potentially time consuming operation)
the remaining tasks can be abandoned or a new higher
priority task (i.e. to service a synchronous request
or a visible area) can be taken on.

While the child view is being accessed
a read lock is acquired on the associated document
so that the model is stable while being accessed.

:   1.3

  + ### setEstimatedMajorSpan

    protected void setEstimatedMajorSpan(boolean isEstimated)

    Set the estimatedMajorSpan property that determines if the
    major span should be treated as being estimated. If this
    property is true, the value of setSize along the major axis
    will change the requirements along the major axis and incremental
    changes will be ignored until all of the children have been updated
    (which will cause the property to automatically be set to false).
    If the property is false the value of the majorSpan will be
    considered to be accurate and incremental changes will be
    added into the total as they are calculated.

    Fetch the object representing the layout state of
    of the child at the given index.

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - the child index. This should be a
        value >= 0 and < getViewCount().

    Returns:
    :   the object representing the layout state of
        of the child at the given index
  + ### getLayoutQueue

    protected [LayoutQueue](LayoutQueue.md "class in javax.swing.text") getLayoutQueue()

    Fetch the queue to use for layout.

    Returns:
    :   the queue to use for layout
  + ### createChildState

    protected [AsyncBoxView.ChildState](AsyncBoxView.ChildState.md "class in javax.swing.text") createChildState([View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") v)

    New ChildState records are created through
    this method to allow subclasses the extend
    the ChildState records to do/hold more.

    Parameters:
    :   `v` - the view

    Returns:
    :   new child state
  + ### majorRequirementChange

    protected void majorRequirementChange([AsyncBoxView.ChildState](AsyncBoxView.ChildState.md "class in javax.swing.text") cs,
    float delta)

    Requirements changed along the major axis.
    This is called by the thread doing layout for
    the given ChildState object when it has completed
    fetching the child views new preferences.
    Typically this would be the layout thread, but
    might be the event thread if it is trying to update
    something immediately (such as to perform a
    model/view translation).

    This is implemented to mark the major axis as having
    changed so that a future check to see if the requirements
    need to be published to the parent view will consider
    the major axis. If the span along the major axis is
    not estimated, it is updated by the given delta to reflect
    the incremental change. The delta is ignored if the
    major span is estimated.

    Parameters:
    :   `cs` - the child state
    :   `delta` - the delta
  + ### minorRequirementChange

    protected void minorRequirementChange([AsyncBoxView.ChildState](AsyncBoxView.ChildState.md "class in javax.swing.text") cs)

    Requirements changed along the minor axis.
    This is called by the thread doing layout for
    the given ChildState object when it has completed
    fetching the child views new preferences.
    Typically this would be the layout thread, but
    might be the GUI thread if it is trying to update
    something immediately (such as to perform a
    model/view translation).

    Parameters:
    :   `cs` - the child state
  + ### flushRequirementChanges

    protected void flushRequirementChanges()

    Publish the changes in preferences upward to the parent
    view. This is normally called by the layout thread.
  + ### replace

    public void replace(int offset,
    int length,
    [View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text")[] views)

    Calls the superclass to update the child views, and
    updates the status records for the children. This
    is expected to be called while a write lock is held
    on the model so that interaction with the layout
    thread will not happen (i.e. the layout thread
    acquires a read lock before doing anything).

    Overrides:
    :   `replace` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `offset` - the starting offset into the child views >= 0
    :   `length` - the number of existing views to replace >= 0
    :   `views` - the child views to insert
  + ### loadChildren

    protected void loadChildren([ViewFactory](ViewFactory.md "interface in javax.swing.text") f)

    Loads all of the children to initialize the view.
    This is called by the [`setParent`](#setParent(javax.swing.text.View))
    method. Subclasses can reimplement this to initialize
    their child views in a different manner. The default
    implementation creates a child view for each
    child element.

    Normally a write-lock is held on the Document while
    the children are being changed, which keeps the rendering
    and layout threads safe. The exception to this is when
    the view is initialized to represent an existing element
    (via this method), so it is synchronized to exclude
    preferenceChanged while we are initializing.

    Parameters:
    :   `f` - the view factory

    See Also:
    :   - [`setParent(javax.swing.text.View)`](#setParent(javax.swing.text.View))
  + ### getViewIndexAtPosition

    protected int getViewIndexAtPosition(int pos,
    [Position.Bias](Position.Bias.md "class in javax.swing.text") b)

    Fetches the child view index representing the given position in
    the model. This is implemented to fetch the view in the case
    where there is a child view for each child element.

    Parameters:
    :   `pos` - the position >= 0
    :   `b` - the position bias

    Returns:
    :   index of the view representing the given position, or
        -1 if no view represents that position
  + ### updateLayout

    protected void updateLayout([DocumentEvent.ElementChange](../event/DocumentEvent.ElementChange.md "interface in javax.swing.event") ec,
    [DocumentEvent](../event/DocumentEvent.md "interface in javax.swing.event") e,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") a)

    Update the layout in response to receiving notification of
    change from the model. This is implemented to note the
    change on the ChildLocator so that offsets of the children
    will be correctly computed.

    Overrides:
    :   `updateLayout` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `ec` - changes to the element this view is responsible
        for (may be null if there were no changes).
    :   `e` - the change information from the associated document
    :   `a` - the current allocation of the view

    See Also:
    :   - [`View.insertUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)`](View.md#insertUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent,java.awt.Shape,javax.swing.text.ViewFactory))
        - [`View.removeUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)`](View.md#removeUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent,java.awt.Shape,javax.swing.text.ViewFactory))
        - [`View.changedUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)`](View.md#changedUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent,java.awt.Shape,javax.swing.text.ViewFactory))
  + ### setParent

    public void setParent([View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") parent)

    Sets the parent of the view.
    This is reimplemented to provide the superclass
    behavior as well as calling the `loadChildren`
    method if this view does not already have children.
    The children should not be loaded in the
    constructor because the act of setting the parent
    may cause them to try to search up the hierarchy
    (to get the hosting Container for example).
    If this view has children (the view is being moved
    from one place in the view hierarchy to another),
    the `loadChildren` method will not be called.

    Overrides:
    :   `setParent` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `parent` - the parent of the view, null if none
  + ### preferenceChanged

    public void preferenceChanged([View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") child,
    boolean width,
    boolean height)

    Child views can call this on the parent to indicate that
    the preference has changed and should be reconsidered
    for layout. This is reimplemented to queue new work
    on the layout thread. This method gets messaged from
    multiple threads via the children.

    Overrides:
    :   `preferenceChanged` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `child` - the child view
    :   `width` - true if the width preference has changed
    :   `height` - true if the height preference has changed

    See Also:
    :   - [`JComponent.revalidate()`](../JComponent.md#revalidate())
  + ### setSize

    public void setSize(float width,
    float height)

    Sets the size of the view. This should cause
    layout of the view if the view caches any layout
    information.

    Since the major axis is updated asynchronously and should be
    the sum of the tiled children the call is ignored for the major
    axis. Since the minor axis is flexible, work is queued to resize
    the children if the minor span changes.

    Overrides:
    :   `setSize` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `width` - the width >= 0
    :   `height` - the height >= 0
  + ### paint

    public void paint([Graphics](../../../java/awt/Graphics.md "class in java.awt") g,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") alloc)

    Render the view using the given allocation and
    rendering surface.

    This is implemented to determine whether or not the
    desired region to be rendered (i.e. the unclipped
    area) is up to date or not. If up-to-date the children
    are rendered. If not up-to-date, a task to build
    the desired area is placed on the layout queue as
    a high priority task. This keeps by event thread
    moving by rendering if ready, and postponing until
    a later time if not ready (since paint requests
    can be rescheduled).

    Specified by:
    :   `paint` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `g` - the rendering surface to use
    :   `alloc` - the allocated region to render into

    See Also:
    :   - [`View.paint(java.awt.Graphics, java.awt.Shape)`](View.md#paint(java.awt.Graphics,java.awt.Shape))
  + ### getPreferredSpan

    public float getPreferredSpan(int axis)

    Determines the preferred span for this view along an
    axis.

    Specified by:
    :   `getPreferredSpan` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - may be either View.X\_AXIS or View.Y\_AXIS

    Returns:
    :   the span the view would like to be rendered into >= 0.
        Typically the view is told to render into the span
        that is returned, although there is no guarantee.
        The parent may choose to resize or break the view.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - for an invalid axis type
  + ### getMinimumSpan

    public float getMinimumSpan(int axis)

    Determines the minimum span for this view along an
    axis.

    Overrides:
    :   `getMinimumSpan` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - may be either View.X\_AXIS or View.Y\_AXIS

    Returns:
    :   the span the view would like to be rendered into >= 0.
        Typically the view is told to render into the span
        that is returned, although there is no guarantee.
        The parent may choose to resize or break the view.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - for an invalid axis type

    See Also:
    :   - [`View.getPreferredSpan(int)`](View.md#getPreferredSpan(int))
  + ### getMaximumSpan

    public float getMaximumSpan(int axis)

    Determines the maximum span for this view along an
    axis.

    Overrides:
    :   `getMaximumSpan` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - may be either View.X\_AXIS or View.Y\_AXIS

    Returns:
    :   the span the view would like to be rendered into >= 0.
        Typically the view is told to render into the span
        that is returned, although there is no guarantee.
        The parent may choose to resize or break the view.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - for an invalid axis type

    See Also:
    :   - [`View.getPreferredSpan(int)`](View.md#getPreferredSpan(int))
  + ### getViewCount

    public int getViewCount()

    Returns the number of views in this view. Since
    the default is to not be a composite view this
    returns 0.

    Overrides:
    :   `getViewCount` in class `View`

    Returns:
    :   the number of views >= 0

    See Also:
    :   - [`View.getViewCount()`](View.md#getViewCount())
  + ### getView

    public [View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") getView(int n)

    Gets the nth child view. Since there are no
    children by default, this returns null.

    Overrides:
    :   `getView` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `n` - the number of the view to get, >= 0 && < getViewCount()

    Returns:
    :   the view
  + ### getChildAllocation

    public [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") getChildAllocation(int index,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") a)

    Fetches the allocation for the given child view.
    This enables finding out where various views
    are located, without assuming the views store
    their location. This returns null since the
    default is to not have any child views.

    Overrides:
    :   `getChildAllocation` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - the index of the child, >= 0 && < getViewCount()
    :   `a` - the allocation to this view.

    Returns:
    :   the allocation to the child
  + ### getViewIndex

    public int getViewIndex(int pos,
    [Position.Bias](Position.Bias.md "class in javax.swing.text") b)

    Returns the child view index representing the given position in
    the model. By default a view has no children so this is implemented
    to return -1 to indicate there is no valid child index for any
    position.

    Overrides:
    :   `getViewIndex` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `pos` - the position >= 0
    :   `b` - the bias

    Returns:

        -1 if no view represents that position

    Since:
    :   1.3
  + ### modelToView

    public [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") modelToView(int pos,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") a,
    [Position.Bias](Position.Bias.md "class in javax.swing.text") b)
    throws [BadLocationException](BadLocationException.md "class in javax.swing.text")

    Provides a mapping from the document model coordinate space
    to the coordinate space of the view mapped to it.

    Specified by:
    :   `modelToView` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `pos` - the position to convert >= 0
    :   `a` - the allocated region to render into
    :   `b` - the bias toward the previous character or the
        next character represented by the offset, in case the
        position is a boundary of two views.

    Returns:
    :   the bounding box of the given position is returned

    Throws:
    :   `BadLocationException` - if the given position does
        not represent a valid location in the associated document
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - for an invalid bias argument

    :   - [`View.viewToModel(float, float, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.Position.Bias[])`](View.md#viewToModel(float,float,java.awt.Shape,javax.swing.text.Position.Bias%5B%5D))
  + ### viewToModel

    public int viewToModel(float x,
    float y,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") a,
    [Position.Bias](Position.Bias.md "class in javax.swing.text")[] biasReturn)

    Provides a mapping from the view coordinate space to the logical
    coordinate space of the model. The biasReturn argument will be
    filled in to indicate that the point given is closer to the next
    character in the model or the previous character in the model.

    This is expected to be called by the GUI thread, holding a
    read-lock on the associated model. It is implemented to
    locate the child view and determine it's allocation with a
    lock on the ChildLocator object, and to call viewToModel
    on the child view with a lock on the ChildState object
    to avoid interaction with the layout thread.

    Specified by:
    :   `viewToModel` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `x` - the X coordinate >= 0
    :   `y` - the Y coordinate >= 0
    :   `a` - the allocated region to render into
    :   `biasReturn` - the returned bias

    Returns:
    :   the location within the model that best represents the
        given point in the view >= 0. The biasReturn argument will be
        filled in to indicate that the point given is closer to the next
        character in the model or the previous character in the model.
  + ### getNextVisualPositionFrom

    public int getNextVisualPositionFrom(int pos,
    [Position.Bias](Position.Bias.md "class in javax.swing.text") b,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") a,
    int direction,
    [Position.Bias](Position.Bias.md "class in javax.swing.text")[] biasRet)
    throws [BadLocationException](BadLocationException.md "class in javax.swing.text")

    Provides a way to determine the next visually represented model
    location that one might place a caret. Some views may not be visible,
    they might not be in the same order found in the model, or they just
    might not allow access to some of the locations in the model.
    This method enables specifying a position to convert
    within the range of >=0. If the value is -1, a position
    will be calculated automatically. If the value < -1,
    the `BadLocationException` will be thrown.

    Overrides:
    :   `getNextVisualPositionFrom` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `pos` - the position to convert
    :   `b` - the bias
    :   `a` - the allocated region to render into
    :   `direction` - the direction from the current position that can
        be thought of as the arrow keys typically found on a keyboard;
        this may be one of the following:
        - `SwingConstants.WEST`
        - `SwingConstants.EAST`
        - `SwingConstants.NORTH`
        - `SwingConstants.SOUTH`
    :   `biasRet` - an array contain the bias that was checked

    Returns:
    :   the location within the model that best represents the next
        location visual position

    Throws:
    :   `BadLocationException` - the given position is not a valid
        position within the document
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `direction` is invalid
