public abstract class View
extends [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [SwingConstants](../SwingConstants.md "interface in javax.swing")

A very important part of the text package is the `View` class.
As the name suggests it represents a view of the text model,
or a piece of the text model.
It is this class that is responsible for the look of the text component.
The view is not intended to be some completely new thing that one must
learn, but rather is much like a lightweight component.

By default, a view is very light. It contains a reference to the parent
view from which it can fetch many things without holding state, and it
contains a reference to a portion of the model (`Element`).
A view does not
have to exactly represent an element in the model, that is simply a typical
and therefore convenient mapping. A view can alternatively maintain a couple
of Position objects to maintain its location in the model (i.e. represent
a fragment of an element). This is typically the result of formatting where
views have been broken down into pieces. The convenience of a substantial
relationship to the element makes it easier to build factories to produce the
views, and makes it easier to keep track of the view pieces as the model is
changed and the view must be changed to reflect the model. Simple views
therefore represent an Element directly and complex views do not.

A view has the following responsibilities:

**Participate in layout.**: The view has a `setSize` method which is like `doLayout` and `setSize` in `Component` combined. The view has a `preferenceChanged` method which is like `invalidate` in `Component` except that one can invalidate just one axis and the child requesting the change is identified. A View expresses the size that it would like to be in terms of three values, a minimum, a preferred, and a maximum span. Layout in a view is can be done independently upon each axis. For a properly functioning View implementation, the minimum span will be <= the preferred span which in turn will be <= the maximum span. ![The above text describes this graphic.](doc-files/View-flexibility.jpg) The minimum set of methods for layout are: * [`getMinimumSpan`](#getMinimumSpan(int))* [`getPreferredSpan`](#getPreferredSpan(int))* [`getMaximumSpan`](#getMaximumSpan(int))* [`getAlignment`](#getAlignment(int))* [`preferenceChanged`](#preferenceChanged(javax.swing.text.View,boolean,boolean))* [`setSize`](#setSize(float,float)) The `setSize` method should be prepared to be called a number of times (i.e. It may be called even if the size didn't change). The `setSize` method is generally called to make sure the View layout is complete prior to trying to perform an operation on it that requires an up-to-date layout. A view's size should *always* be set to a value within the minimum and maximum span specified by that view. Additionally, the view must always call the `preferenceChanged` method on the parent if it has changed the values for the layout it would like, and expects the parent to honor. The parent View is not required to recognize a change until the `preferenceChanged` has been sent. This allows parent View implementations to cache the child requirements if desired. The calling sequence looks something like the following: ![Sample calling sequence between parent view and child view: setSize, getMinimum, getPreferred, getMaximum, getAlignment, setSize](doc-files/View-layout.jpg) The exact calling sequence is up to the layout functionality of the parent view (if the view has any children). The view may collect the preferences of the children prior to determining what it will give each child, or it might iteratively update the children one at a time. **Render a portion of the model.**: This is done in the paint method, which is pretty much like a component paint method. Views are expected to potentially populate a fairly large tree. A `View` has the following semantics for rendering: * The view gets its allocation from the parent at paint time, so it must be prepared to redo layout if the allocated area is different from what it is prepared to deal with.* The coordinate system is the same as the hosting `Component` (i.e. the `Component` returned by the [`getContainer`](#getContainer()) method). This means a child view lives in the same coordinate system as the parent view unless the parent has explicitly changed the coordinate system. To schedule itself to be repainted a view can call repaint on the hosting `Component`.* The default is to *not clip* the children. It is more efficient to allow a view to clip only if it really feels it needs clipping.* The `Graphics` object given is not initialized in any way. A view should set any settings needed.* A `View` is inherently transparent. While a view may render into its entire allocation, typically a view does not. Rendering is performed by traversing down the tree of `View` implementations. Each `View` is responsible for rendering its children. This behavior is depended upon for thread safety. While view implementations do not necessarily have to be implemented with thread safety in mind, other view implementations that do make use of concurrency can depend upon a tree traversal to guarantee thread safety.* The order of views relative to the model is up to the implementation. Although child views will typically be arranged in the same order that they occur in the model, they may be visually arranged in an entirely different order. View implementations may have Z-Order associated with them if the children are overlapping. The methods for rendering are: * [`paint`](#paint(java.awt.Graphics,java.awt.Shape)) **Translate between the model and view coordinate systems.**: Because the view objects are produced from a factory and therefore cannot necessarily be counted upon to be in a particular pattern, one must be able to perform translation to properly locate spatial representation of the model. The methods for doing this are: * [`modelToView`](#modelToView(int,javax.swing.text.Position.Bias,int,javax.swing.text.Position.Bias,java.awt.Shape))* [`viewToModel`](#viewToModel(float,float,java.awt.Shape,javax.swing.text.Position.Bias%5B%5D))* [`getDocument`](#getDocument())* [`getElement`](#getElement())* [`getStartOffset`](#getStartOffset())* [`getEndOffset`](#getEndOffset()) The layout must be valid prior to attempting to make the translation. The translation is not valid, and must not be attempted while changes are being broadcasted from the model via a `DocumentEvent`. **Respond to changes from the model.**: If the overall view is represented by many pieces (which is the best situation if one want to be able to change the view and write the least amount of new code), it would be impractical to have a huge number of `DocumentListener`s. If each view listened to the model, only a few would actually be interested in the changes broadcasted at any given time. Since the model has no knowledge of views, it has no way to filter the broadcast of change information. The view hierarchy itself is instead responsible for propagating the change information. At any level in the view hierarchy, that view knows enough about its children to best distribute the change information further. Changes are therefore broadcasted starting from the root of the view hierarchy. The methods for doing this are: * [`insertUpdate`](#insertUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent,java.awt.Shape,javax.swing.text.ViewFactory))* [`removeUpdate`](#removeUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent,java.awt.Shape,javax.swing.text.ViewFactory))* [`changedUpdate`](#changedUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent,java.awt.Shape,javax.swing.text.ViewFactory))

    public abstract float getPreferredSpan(int axis)

    Determines the preferred span for this view along an
    axis.

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - may be either `View.X_AXIS` or
        `View.Y_AXIS`

    Returns:
    :   the span the view would like to be rendered into.
        Typically the view is told to render into the span
        that is returned, although there is no guarantee.
        The parent may choose to resize or break the view
  + ### getMinimumSpan

    public float getMinimumSpan(int axis)

    Determines the minimum span for this view along an
    axis.

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - may be either `View.X_AXIS` or
        `View.Y_AXIS`

  + ### getMaximumSpan

    public float getMaximumSpan(int axis)

    Determines the maximum span for this view along an
    axis.

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - may be either `View.X_AXIS` or
        `View.Y_AXIS`

  + ### preferenceChanged

    public void preferenceChanged([View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") child,
    boolean width,
    boolean height)

    Child views can call this on the parent to indicate that
    the preference has changed and should be reconsidered
    for layout. By default this just propagates upward to
    the next parent. The root view will call
    `revalidate` on the associated text component.

    Parameters:
    :   `child` - the child view
    :   `width` - true if the width preference has changed
    :   `height` - true if the height preference has changed

    See Also:
    :   - [`JComponent.revalidate()`](../JComponent.md#revalidate())
  + ### getAlignment

    public float getAlignment(int axis)

    Determines the desired alignment for this view along an
    axis. The desired alignment is returned. This should be
    a value >= 0.0 and <= 1.0, where 0 indicates alignment at
    the origin and 1.0 indicates alignment to the full span
    away from the origin. An alignment of 0.5 would be the
    center of the view.

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - may be either `View.X_AXIS` or
        `View.Y_AXIS`

    Returns:
    :   the value 0.5
  + ### paint

    public abstract void paint([Graphics](../../../java/awt/Graphics.md "class in java.awt") g,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") allocation)

    Renders using the given rendering surface and area on that
    surface. The view may need to do layout and create child
    views to enable itself to render into the given allocation.

    Parameters:
    :   `g` - the rendering surface to use
    :   `allocation` - the allocated region to render into
  + ### setParent

    public void setParent([View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") parent)

    Establishes the parent view for this view. This is
    guaranteed to be called before any other methods if the
    parent view is functioning properly. This is also
    the last method called, since it is called to indicate
    the view has been removed from the hierarchy as
    well. When this method is called to set the parent to
    null, this method does the same for each of its children,
    propagating the notification that they have been
    disconnected from the view tree. If this is
    reimplemented, `super.setParent()` should
    be called.

    Parameters:
    :   `parent` - the new parent, or `null` if the view is
        being removed from a parent
  + ### getViewCount

    public int getViewCount()

    Returns the number of views in this view. Since
    the default is to not be a composite view this
    returns 0.

    Returns:
    :   the number of views >= 0
  + ### getView

    public [View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") getView(int n)

    Gets the *n*th child view. Since there are no
    children by default, this returns `null`.

    Parameters:
    :   `n` - the number of the view to get, >= 0 && < getViewCount()

    Returns:
    :   the view
  + ### removeAll

    public void removeAll()

    Removes all of the children. This is a convenience
    call to `replace`.

    Since:
    :   1.3
  + ### remove

    public void remove(int i)

    Removes one of the children at the given position.
    This is a convenience call to `replace`.

    Parameters:
    :   `i` - the position

    Since:
    :   1.3
  + ### insert

    public void insert(int offs,
    [View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") v)

    Inserts a single child view. This is a convenience
    call to `replace`.

    Parameters:
    :   `offs` - the offset of the view to insert before >= 0
    :   `v` - the view

    Since:
    :   1.3

    See Also:
    :   - [`replace(int, int, javax.swing.text.View[])`](#replace(int,int,javax.swing.text.View%5B%5D))
  + ### append

    public void append([View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") v)

    Appends a single child view. This is a convenience
    call to `replace`.

    Parameters:
    :   `v` - the view

    Since:
    :   1.3

    See Also:
    :   - [`replace(int, int, javax.swing.text.View[])`](#replace(int,int,javax.swing.text.View%5B%5D))
  + ### replace

    public void replace(int offset,
    int length,
    [View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text")[] views)

    Replaces child views. If there are no views to remove
    this acts as an insert. If there are no views to
    add this acts as a remove. Views being removed will
    have the parent set to `null`, and the internal reference
    to them removed so that they can be garbage collected.
    This is implemented to do nothing, because by default
    a view has no children.

    Parameters:
    :   `offset` - the starting index into the child views to insert
        the new views. This should be a value >= 0 and <= getViewCount
    :   `length` - the number of existing child views to remove
        This should be a value >= 0 and <= (getViewCount() - offset).
    :   `views` - the child views to add. This value can be
        `null` to indicate no children are being added
        (useful to remove).

    Since:
    :   1.3
  + ### getViewIndex

    public int getViewIndex(int pos,
    [Position.Bias](Position.Bias.md "class in javax.swing.text") b)

    Returns the child view index representing the given position in
    the model. By default a view has no children so this is implemented
    to return -1 to indicate there is no valid child index for any
    position.

    Parameters:
    :   `pos` - the position >= 0
    :   `b` - the bias

    Returns:
    :   index of the view representing the given position, or
        -1 if no view represents that position

    Since:
    :   1.3
  + ### getChildAllocation

    public [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") getChildAllocation(int index,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") a)

    Fetches the allocation for the given child view.
    This enables finding out where various views
    are located, without assuming how the views store
    their location. This returns `null` since the
    default is to not have any child views.

    Parameters:

    int direction,
    [Position.Bias](Position.Bias.md "class in javax.swing.text")[] biasRet)
    throws [BadLocationException](BadLocationException.md "class in javax.swing.text")

    Provides a way to determine the next visually represented model
    location at which one might place a caret.
    Some views may not be visible,
    they might not be in the same order found in the model, or they just
    might not allow access to some of the locations in the model.
    This method enables specifying a position to convert
    within the range of >=0. If the value is -1, a position
    will be calculated automatically. If the value < -1,
    the `BadLocationException` will be thrown.

    Parameters:
    :   `pos` - the position to convert
    :   `b` - the bias
    :   `a` - the allocated region in which to render
    :   `direction` - the direction from the current position that can
        be thought of as the arrow keys typically found on a keyboard.
        This will be one of the following values:
        - SwingConstants.WEST- SwingConstants.EAST- SwingConstants.NORTH- SwingConstants.SOUTH
    :   `biasRet` - the returned bias

    Returns:
    :   the location within the model that best represents the next
        location visual position

    Throws:
    :   `BadLocationException` - the given position is not a valid
        position within the document
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `direction`
        doesn't have one of the legal values above

    :   `a` - the area of the view, which encompasses the requested character
    :   `b` - the bias toward the previous character or the
        next character represented by the offset, in case the
        position is a boundary of two views; `b` will have one
        of these values:
        - `Position.Bias.Forward`- `Position.Bias.Backward`

    Returns:
    :   the bounding box, in view coordinate space,
        of the character at the specified position

    Throws:
    :   `BadLocationException` - if the specified position does
        not represent a valid location in the associated document

  + ### getGraphics

    public [Graphics](../../../java/awt/Graphics.md "class in java.awt") getGraphics()

    Fetch a `Graphics` for rendering.
    This can be used to determine
    font characteristics, and will be different for a print view
    than a component view.

    Returns:
    :   a `Graphics` object for rendering

    Since:
    :   1.3
  + ### getAttributes

    public [AttributeSet](AttributeSet.md "interface in javax.swing.text") getAttributes()

    Fetches the attributes to use when rendering. By default
    this simply returns the attributes of the associated element.
    This method should be used rather than using the element
    directly to obtain access to the attributes to allow
    view-specific attributes to be mixed in or to allow the
    view to have view-specific conversion of attributes by
    subclasses.
    Each view should document what attributes it recognizes
    for the purpose of rendering or layout, and should always
    access them through the `AttributeSet` returned
    by this method.

    Returns:
    :   the attributes to use when rendering
  + ### breakView

    public [View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") breakView(int axis,
    int offset,
    float pos,
    float len)

    Tries to break this view on the given axis. This is
    called by views that try to do formatting of their
    children. For example, a view of a paragraph will
    typically try to place its children into row and
    views representing chunks of text can sometimes be
    broken down into smaller pieces.

    This is implemented to return the view itself, which
    represents the default behavior on not being
    breakable. If the view does support breaking, the
    starting offset of the view returned should be the
    given offset, and the end offset should be less than
    or equal to the end offset of the view being broken.

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - may be either `View.X_AXIS` or
        `View.Y_AXIS`
    :   `offset` - the location in the document model
        that a broken fragment would occupy >= 0. This
        would be the starting offset of the fragment
        returned
    :   `pos` - the position along the axis that the
        broken view would occupy >= 0. This may be useful for
        things like tab calculations
    :   `len` - specifies the distance along the axis
        where a potential break is desired >= 0

    Returns:
    :   the fragment of the view that represents the
        given span, if the view can be broken. If the view
        doesn't support breaking behavior, the view itself is
        returned.

    See Also:
    :   - [`ParagraphView`](ParagraphView.md "class in javax.swing.text")
  + ### createFragment

    public [View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") createFragment(int p0,
    int p1)

    Creates a view that represents a portion of the element.
    This is potentially useful during formatting operations
    for taking measurements of fragments of the view. If
    the view doesn't support fragmenting (the default), it
    should return itself.

    Parameters:
    :   `p0` - the starting offset >= 0. This should be a value
        greater or equal to the element starting offset and
        less than the element ending offset.
    :   `p1` - the ending offset > p0. This should be a value
        less than or equal to the elements end offset and
        greater than the elements starting offset.

    Returns:
    :   the view fragment, or itself if the view doesn't
        support breaking into fragments

    :   - [`LabelView`](LabelView.md "class in javax.swing.text")
  + ### getBreakWeight

    public int getBreakWeight(int axis,
    float pos,
    float len)

    Determines how attractive a break opportunity in
    this view is. This can be used for determining which
    view is the most attractive to call `breakView`
    on in the process of formatting. A view that represents
    text that has whitespace in it might be more attractive
    than a view that has no whitespace, for example. The
    higher the weight, the more attractive the break. A
    value equal to or lower than `BadBreakWeight`
    should not be considered for a break. A value greater
    than or equal to `ForcedBreakWeight` should
    be broken.

    This is implemented to provide the default behavior
    of returning `BadBreakWeight` unless the length
    is greater than the length of the view in which case the
    entire view represents the fragment. Unless a view has
    been written to support breaking behavior, it is not
    attractive to try and break the view. An example of
    a view that does support breaking is `LabelView`.
    An example of a view that uses break weight is
    `ParagraphView`.

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - may be either `View.X_AXIS` or
        `View.Y_AXIS`
    :   `pos` - the potential location of the start of the
        broken view >= 0. This may be useful for calculating tab
        positions
    :   `len` - specifies the relative length from *pos*
        where a potential break is desired >= 0

    Returns:
    :   the weight, which should be a value between
        ForcedBreakWeight and BadBreakWeight

  + ### getResizeWeight

    public int getResizeWeight(int axis)

    Determines the resizability of the view along the
    given axis. A value of 0 or less is not resizable.

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - may be either `View.X_AXIS` or
        `View.Y_AXIS`

    Returns:
    :   the weight
  + ### setSize

    public void setSize(float width,
    float height)

    Sets the size of the view. This should cause
    layout of the view along the given axis, if it
    has any layout duties.

    Parameters:
    :   `width` - the width >= 0
    :   `height` - the height >= 0
  + ### getContainer

    public [Container](../../../java/awt/Container.md "class in java.awt") getContainer()

    Fetches the container hosting the view. This is useful for
    things like scheduling a repaint, finding out the host
    components font, etc. The default implementation
    of this is to forward the query to the parent view.

    Returns:
    :   the container, `null` if none
  + ### getViewFactory

    public [ViewFactory](ViewFactory.md "interface in javax.swing.text") getViewFactory()

    Fetches the `ViewFactory` implementation that is feeding
    the view hierarchy. Normally the views are given this
    as an argument to updates from the model when they
    are most likely to need the factory, but this
    method serves to provide it at other times.

    Returns:
    :   the factory, `null` if none

    Returns the tooltip text at the specified location. The default
    implementation returns the value from the child View identified by
    the passed in location.

    Parameters:
    :   `x` - the x coordinate
    :   `y` - the y coordinate
    :   `allocation` - current allocation of the View.

    Returns:

    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") allocation)

    Returns the child view index representing the given position in
    the view. This iterates over all the children returning the
    first with a bounds that contains `x`, `y`.

    Parameters:
    :   `x` - the x coordinate
    :   `y` - the y coordinate
    :   `allocation` - current allocation of the View.

    Returns:
    :   index of the view representing the given location, or
        -1 if no view represents that position

    [DocumentEvent](../event/DocumentEvent.md "interface in javax.swing.event") e,
    [ViewFactory](ViewFactory.md "interface in javax.swing.text") f)

    Updates the child views in response to receiving notification
    that the model changed, and there is change record for the
    element this view is responsible for. This is implemented
    to assume the child views are directly responsible for the
    child elements of the element this view represents. The
    `ViewFactory` is used to create child views for each element
    specified as added in the `ElementChange`, starting at the
    index specified in the given `ElementChange`. The number of
    child views representing the removed elements specified are
    removed.

    Parameters:
    :   `ec` - the change information for the element this view
        is responsible for. This should not be `null` if
        this method gets called
    :   `e` - the change information from the associated document
    :   `f` - the factory to use to build child views

    Returns:
    :   whether or not the child views represent the
        child elements of the element this view is responsible
        for. Some views create children that represent a portion
        of the element they are responsible for, and should return
        false. This information is used to determine if views
        in the range of the added elements should be forwarded to
        or not

    notified).

    Parameters:
    :   `ec` - changes to the element this view is responsible
        for (may be `null` if there were no changes).
    :   `e` - the change information from the associated document
    :   `a` - the current allocation of the view
    :   `f` - the factory to use to rebuild if the view has children

    Since:
    :   1.3

  + ### forwardUpdateToView

    protected void forwardUpdateToView([View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") v,
    [DocumentEvent](../event/DocumentEvent.md "interface in javax.swing.event") e,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") a,
    [ViewFactory](ViewFactory.md "interface in javax.swing.text") f)

    Forwards the `DocumentEvent` to the give child view. This
    simply messages the view with a call to `insertUpdate`,
    `removeUpdate`, or `changedUpdate` depending
    upon the type of the event. This is called by
    [`forwardUpdate`](#forwardUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent.ElementChange,javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent,java.awt.Shape,javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)) to forward
    the event to children that need it.

    Parameters:
    :   `v` - the child view to forward the event to
    :   `e` - the change information from the associated document
    :   `a` - the current allocation of the view
    :   `f` - the factory to use to rebuild if the view has children

    Since:
    :   1.3

  + ### updateLayout

    protected void updateLayout([DocumentEvent.ElementChange](../event/DocumentEvent.ElementChange.md "interface in javax.swing.event") ec,
    [DocumentEvent](../event/DocumentEvent.md "interface in javax.swing.event") e,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") a)

    Updates the layout in response to receiving notification of
    change from the model. This is implemented to call
    `preferenceChanged` to reschedule a new layout
    if the `ElementChange` record is not `null`.

    Parameters:
    :   `ec` - changes to the element this view is responsible
        for (may be `null` if there were no changes)
    :   `e` - the change information from the associated document
    :   `a` - the current allocation of the view

    [@Deprecated](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Deprecated.md "annotation interface in java.lang")
    public [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") modelToView(int pos,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") a)
    throws [BadLocationException](BadLocationException.md "class in javax.swing.text")

    Deprecated.

    Provides a mapping from the document model coordinate space
    to the coordinate space of the view mapped to it. This is
    implemented to default the bias to `Position.Bias.Forward`
    which was previously implied.

    Parameters:
    :   `pos` - the position to convert >= 0
    :   `a` - the allocated region in which to render

    Returns:
    :   the bounding box of the given position is returned

    Throws:
    :   `BadLocationException` - if the given position does
        not represent a valid location in the associated document

    public int viewToModel(float x,
    float y,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") a)

    Deprecated.

    Provides a mapping from the view coordinate space to the logical
    coordinate space of the model.

    Parameters:
    :   `x` - the X coordinate >= 0
    :   `y` - the Y coordinate >= 0
    :   `a` - the allocated region in which to render

    Returns:
    :   the location within the model that best represents the
        given point in the view >= 0
