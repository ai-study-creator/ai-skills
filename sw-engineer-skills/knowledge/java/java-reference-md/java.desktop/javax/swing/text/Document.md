public interface Document

The `Document` is a container for text that serves
as the model for swing text components. The goal for this
interface is to scale from very simple needs (a plain text textfield)
to complex needs (an HTML or XML document, for example).

**Content**

At the simplest level, text can be
modeled as a linear sequence of characters. To support
internationalization, the Swing text model uses
[unicode](http://www.unicode.org/) characters.
The sequence of characters displayed in a text component is
generally referred to as the component's *content*.

To refer to locations within the sequence, the coordinates
used are the location between two characters. As the diagram
below shows, a location in a text document can be referred to
as a position, or an offset. This position is zero-based.

![The following text describes this graphic.](doc-files/Document-coord.gif)

In the example, if the content of a document is the
sequence "The quick brown fox," as shown in the preceding diagram,
the location just before the word "The" is 0, and the location after
the word "The" and before the whitespace that follows it is 3.
The entire sequence of characters in the sequence "The" is called a
*range*.

The following methods give access to the character data
that makes up the content.

* [`getLength()`](#getLength())* [`getText(int, int)`](#getText(int,int))* [`getText(int, int, javax.swing.text.Segment)`](#getText(int,int,javax.swing.text.Segment))

**Structure**

Text is rarely represented simply as featureless content. Rather,
text typically has some sort of structure associated with it.
Exactly what structure is modeled is up to a particular Document
implementation. It might be as simple as no structure (i.e. a
simple text field), or it might be something like diagram below.

![Diagram shows Book->Chapter->Paragraph](doc-files/Document-structure.gif)

The unit of structure (i.e. a node of the tree) is referred to
by the [Element](Element.md) interface. Each Element
can be tagged with a set of attributes. These attributes
(name/value pairs) are defined by the
[AttributeSet](AttributeSet.md) interface.

The following methods give access to the document structure.

* [`getDefaultRootElement()`](#getDefaultRootElement())* [`getRootElements()`](#getRootElements())

**Mutations**

All documents need to be able to add and remove simple text.
Typically, text is inserted and removed via gestures from
a keyboard or a mouse. What effect the insertion or removal
has upon the document structure is entirely up to the
implementation of the document.

The following methods are related to mutation of the
document content:

* [`insertString(int, java.lang.String, javax.swing.text.AttributeSet)`](#insertString(int,java.lang.String,javax.swing.text.AttributeSet))* [`remove(int, int)`](#remove(int,int))* [`createPosition(int)`](#createPosition(int))

**Notification**

Mutations to the `Document` must be communicated to
interested observers. The notification of change follows the event model
guidelines that are specified for JavaBeans. In the JavaBeans
event model, once an event notification is dispatched, all listeners
must be notified before any further mutations occur to the source
of the event. Further, order of delivery is not guaranteed.

Notification is provided as two separate events,
[DocumentEvent](../event/DocumentEvent.md), and
[UndoableEditEvent](../event/UndoableEditEvent.md).
If a mutation is made to a `Document` through its api,
a `DocumentEvent` will be sent to all of the registered
`DocumentListeners`. If the `Document`
implementation supports undo/redo capabilities, an
`UndoableEditEvent` will be sent
to all of the registered `UndoableEditListener`s.
If an undoable edit is undone, a `DocumentEvent` should be
fired from the Document to indicate it has changed again.
In this case however, there should be no `UndoableEditEvent`
generated since that edit is actually the source of the change
rather than a mutation to the `Document` made through its
api.

![The preceding text describes this graphic.](doc-files/Document-notification.gif)

Referring to the above diagram, suppose that the component shown
on the left mutates the document object represented by the blue
rectangle. The document responds by dispatching a DocumentEvent to
both component views and sends an UndoableEditEvent to the listening
logic, which maintains a history buffer.

Now suppose that the component shown on the right mutates the same
document. Again, the document dispatches a DocumentEvent to both
component views and sends an UndoableEditEvent to the listening logic
that is maintaining the history buffer.

If the history buffer is then rolled back (i.e. the last UndoableEdit
undone), a DocumentEvent is sent to both views, causing both of them to
reflect the undone mutation to the document (that is, the
removal of the right component's mutation). If the history buffer again
rolls back another change, another DocumentEvent is sent to both views,
causing them to reflect the undone mutation to the document -- that is,
the removal of the left component's mutation.

The methods related to observing mutations to the document are:

* [`addDocumentListener(DocumentListener)`](#addDocumentListener(javax.swing.event.DocumentListener))* [`removeDocumentListener(DocumentListener)`](#removeDocumentListener(javax.swing.event.DocumentListener))* [`addUndoableEditListener(UndoableEditListener)`](#addUndoableEditListener(javax.swing.event.UndoableEditListener))* [`removeUndoableEditListener(UndoableEditListener)`](#removeUndoableEditListener(javax.swing.event.UndoableEditListener))

**Properties**

Document implementations will generally have some set of properties
associated with them at runtime. Two well known properties are the
[StreamDescriptionProperty](#StreamDescriptionProperty),
which can be used to describe where the `Document` came from,
and the [TitleProperty](#TitleProperty), which can be used to
name the `Document`. The methods related to the properties are:

* [`getProperty(java.lang.Object)`](#getProperty(java.lang.Object))* [`putProperty(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)`](#putProperty(java.lang.Object,java.lang.Object))

**Overview and Programming Tips**

[`Element`](Element.md "interface in javax.swing.text") is an important interface used in constructing a Document.
It has the power to describe various structural parts of a document,
such as paragraphs, lines of text, or even (in HTML documents) items in lists.
Conceptually, the Element interface captures some of the spirit of an SGML document.
So if you know SGML, you may already have some understanding of Swing's Element interface.

In the Swing text API's document model, the interface Element defines a structural piece of a Document,
like a paragraph, a line of text, or a list item in an HTML document.

Every Element is either a *branch* or a *leaf*. If an element is a branch,
the `isLeaf()` method returns false. If an element is a leaf, `isLeaf()` returns true.

Branches can have any number of children. Leaves do not have children.
To determine how many children a branch has, you can call `getElementCount()`.
To determine the parent of an Element, you can call `getParentElement()`.
Root elements don't have parents, so calling `getParentElement()` on a root returns null.

An Element represents a specific region in a Document that begins with startOffset
and ends just before endOffset.
The start offset of a branch Element is usually the start offset of its first child.
Similarly, the end offset of a branch Element is usually the end offset of its last child.

Every Element is associated with an AttributeSet that you can access by calling `getAttributes()`.
In an Element, and AttributeSet is essentially a set of key/value pairs.
These pairs are generally used for markup -- such as determining the Element's
foreground color, font size, and so on. But it is up to the model, and the developer,
to determine what is stored in the AttributeSet.

You can obtain the root Element (or Elements) of a Document by calling the
methods `getDefaultRootElement()` and `getRootElements()`, which are defined in the Document interface.

The Document interface is responsible for translating a linear view of the
characters into Element operations. It is up to each Document implementation
to define what the Element structure is.

**The PlainDocument class**

The [`PlainDocument`](PlainDocument.md "class in javax.swing.text") class defines an Element
structure in which the root node has a child node for each line of text in the model.
Figure 1 shows how two lines of text would be modeled by a PlainDocument

![The preceding text describes this graphic.](doc-files/plain1.gif)

Figure 2 shows how how those same two lines of text might map to actual content:

![The preceding text describes this graphic.](doc-files/plain2.gif)

**Inserting text into a PlainDocument**

As just mentioned, a PlainDocument contains a root Element, which in turn
contains an Element for each line of text.
When text is inserted into a PlainDocument, it creates the Elements that
are needed for an Element to exist for each newline.
To illustrate, let's say you wanted to insert a newline at offset 2 in Figure 2, above.
To accomplish this objective, you could use the Document method `insertString()`,
using this syntax:

```
document.insertString(2, "\n", null);
```

After invoking the `insertString()` method, the Element structure would look
like the one shown in Figure 3.

![The preceding text describes this graphic.](doc-files/plain3.gif)

As another example, let's say you wanted to insert the pattern "new\ntext\n"
at offset 2 as shown previously in Figure 2. This operation would have the
result shown in Figure 4.

![The preceding text describes this graphic.](doc-files/plain4.gif)

In the preceding illustrations, the name of the line Elements is changed
after the insertion to match the line numbers.
But notice that when this is done, the AttributeSets remain the same.
For example, in Figure 2, the AttributeSet of Line 2 matches that of the
AttributeSet of Line 4 in Figure 4.

**Removing text from a PlainDocument**

Removal of text results in a structure change if the deletion spans more than one line.
Consider a deletion of seven characters starting at Offset 1 shown previously in Figure 3.
In this case, the Element representing Line 2 is completely removed, as the
region it represents is contained in the deleted region.
The Elements representing Lines 1 and 3 are joined, as they are partially
contained in the deleted region. Thus, we have the result:

![The preceding text describes this graphic.](doc-files/plain5.gif)

**The Default StyledDocument Class**

The [`DefaultStyledDocument`](DefaultStyledDocument.md "class in javax.swing.text") class, used for styled text,
contains another level of Elements.
This extra level is needed so that each paragraph can contain different styles of text.
In the two paragraphs shown in Figure 6, the first paragraph contains
two styles and the second paragraph contains three styles.

![The preceding text describes this graphic.](doc-files/plain6.gif)

Figure 7 shows how those same Elements might map to content.

![The preceding text describes this graphic.](doc-files/plain7.gif)

**Inserting text into a DefaultStyledDocument**

As previously mentioned, DefaultStyledDocument maintains an Element structure
such that the root Element
contains a child Element for each paragraph. In turn, each of these
paragraph Elements contains an Element for each style of text in the paragraph.
As an example, let's say you had a document containing one paragraph,
and that this paragraph contained two styles, as shown in Figure 8.

![The preceding text describes this graphic.](doc-files/plain8.gif)

If you then wanted to insert a newline at offset 2, you would again use the
method `insertString()`, as follows:

```
 styledDocument.insertString(2, "\n",
                styledDocument.getCharacterElement(0).getAttributes());
```

This operation would have the result shown in Figure 9.

![The preceding text describes this graphic.](doc-files/plain9.gif)

It's important to note that the AttributeSet passed to `insertString()` matches
that of the attributes of Style 1. If the AttributeSet passed to `insertString()`
did not match, the result would be the situation shown in Figure 10.

![The preceding text describes this graphic.](doc-files/plain10.gif)

**Removing text from a DefaultStyledDocument**

Removing text from a DefaultStyledDocument is similar to removing text from
a PlainDocument. The only difference is the extra level of Elements.
Consider what would happen if you deleted two characters at Offset 1
from Figure 10, above. Since the second Element of Paragraph 1 is
completely contained in the deleted region, it would be removed.
Assuming the attributes of Paragraph 1's first child matched those of
Paragraph2's first child, the results would be those shown in Figure 11.

![The preceding text describes this graphic.](doc-files/plain11.gif)

If the attributes did not match, we would get the results shown in Figure 12.

![The preceding text describes this graphic.](doc-files/plain12.gif)

**The StyledDocument Class**

The [`StyledDocument`](StyledDocument.md "interface in javax.swing.text") class provides a method
named `setCharacterAttributes()`, which allows you to set the attributes
on the character Elements in a given range:

```
 public void setCharacterAttributes
          (int offset, int length, AttributeSet s, boolean replace);
```

Recall that in the diagrams shown in the previous section, all leaf Elements
shown in the drawings were also character Elements.
That means that the `setCharacterAttributes()` method could be used to set their attributes.

The `setCharacterAttributes()` method takes four arguments .
The first and second arguments identify a region in the Document that is
to be changed. The third argument specifies the new attributes
(as an AttributeSet), and the fourth argument determines if the new attributes
should be added to the existing attributes (a value of false) or
if the character Element should replace its existing attributes
with the new attributes (a value of true).

As an example, let's say you wanted to change the attributes of the
first three characters in Figure 9, shown previously.
The first two arguments passed to `setCharacterAttributes()` would be 0 and 3.
The third argument would be the AttributeSet containing the new attributes.
In the example we are considering, it doesn't matter what the fourth argument is.

As the start and end offsets of the changed region (0 and 3) fall on
character Element boundaries, no structure change is needed.
That is, only the attributes of the character Element style 1 will change.

Now let's look at an example that requires a structure change.
Instead of changing the first three characters shown in Figure 9,
let's change the first two characters.
Because the end change offset (2) does not fall on a character Element boundary,
the Element at offset 2 must be split in such a way
that offset 2 is the boundary of two Elements.
Invoking `setCharacterAttributes()` with a start offset of 0
and length of 2 has the result shown earlier in Figure 10.

**Changing Paragraph Attributes in a StyledDocument**

The StyledDocument class provides a method named `setParagraphAttributes()`,
which can be used to change the attributes of a paragraph Element:

```
 public void setParagraphAttributes
         (int offset, int length, AttributeSet s, boolean replace);
```

This method is similar to `setCharacterAttributes()`,
but it allows you to change the attributes of paragraph Elements.
It is up to the implementation of a StyledDocument to define which Elements
are paragraphs. DefaultStyledDocument interprets paragraph Elements
to be the parent Element of the character Element.
Invoking this method does not result in a structure change;
only the attributes of the paragraph Element change.

It is recommended to look into [`EditorKit`](EditorKit.md "class in javax.swing.text") and
[`View`](View.md "class in javax.swing.text").
View is responsible for rendering a particular Element, and
EditorKit is responsible for a ViewFactory that is able to decide what
View should be created based on an Element.

  + ### remove

    void remove(int offs,
    int len)
    throws [BadLocationException](BadLocationException.md "class in javax.swing.text")

    Removes a portion of the content of the document.
    This will cause a DocumentEvent of type
    DocumentEvent.EventType.REMOVE to be sent to the
    registered DocumentListeners, unless an exception
    is thrown. The notification will be sent to the
    listeners by calling the removeUpdate method on the
    DocumentListeners.

    To ensure reasonable behavior in the face
    of concurrency, the event is dispatched after the
    mutation has occurred. This means that by the time a
    notification of removal is dispatched, the document
    has already been updated and any marks created by
    `createPosition` have already changed.
    For a removal, the end of the removal range is collapsed
    down to the start of the range, and any marks in the removal
    range are collapsed down to the start of the range.

    ![Diagram shows removal of 'quick' from 'The quick brown fox.'](doc-files/Document-remove.gif)

    If the Document structure changed as result of the removal,
    the details of what Elements were inserted and removed in
    response to the change will also be contained in the generated
    DocumentEvent. It is up to the implementation of a Document
    to decide how the structure should change in response to a
    remove.

    If the Document supports undo/redo, an UndoableEditEvent will
    also be generated.

    Parameters:
    :   `offs` - the offset from the beginning >= 0
    :   `len` - the number of characters to remove >= 0

    Throws:
    :   `BadLocationException` - some portion of the removal range
        was not a valid part of the document. The location in the exception
        is the first bad position encountered.

  + ### insertString

    void insertString(int offset,
    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") str,
    [AttributeSet](AttributeSet.md "interface in javax.swing.text") a)
    throws [BadLocationException](BadLocationException.md "class in javax.swing.text")

    Inserts a string of content. This will cause a DocumentEvent
    of type DocumentEvent.EventType.INSERT to be sent to the
    registered DocumentListers, unless an exception is thrown.
    The DocumentEvent will be delivered by calling the
    insertUpdate method on the DocumentListener.
    The offset and length of the generated DocumentEvent
    will indicate what change was actually made to the Document.

    ![Diagram shows insertion of 'quick' in 'The quick brown fox'](doc-files/Document-insert.gif)

    If the Document structure changed as result of the insertion,
    the details of what Elements were inserted and removed in
    response to the change will also be contained in the generated
    DocumentEvent. It is up to the implementation of a Document
    to decide how the structure should change in response to an
    insertion.

    If the Document supports undo/redo, an UndoableEditEvent will
    also be generated.

    Parameters:
    :   `offset` - the offset into the document to insert the content >= 0.
        All positions that track change at or after the given location
        will move.
    :   `str` - the string to insert
    :   `a` - the attributes to associate with the inserted
        content. This may be null if there are no attributes.

    Throws:
    :   `BadLocationException` - the given insert position is not a valid
        position within the document

  + ### getText

    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getText(int offset,
    int length)
    throws [BadLocationException](BadLocationException.md "class in javax.swing.text")

    Fetches the text contained within the given portion
    of the document.

    Parameters:
    :   `offset` - the offset into the document representing the desired
        start of the text >= 0
    :   `length` - the length of the desired string >= 0

    Returns:
    :   the text, in a String of length >= 0

    Throws:
    :   `BadLocationException` - some portion of the given range
        was not a valid part of the document. The location in the exception
        is the first bad position encountered.
  + ### getText

    void getText(int offset,
    int length,
    [Segment](Segment.md "class in javax.swing.text") txt)
    throws [BadLocationException](BadLocationException.md "class in javax.swing.text")

    Fetches the text contained within the given portion
    of the document.

    If the partialReturn property on the txt parameter is false, the
    data returned in the Segment will be the entire length requested and
    may or may not be a copy depending upon how the data was stored.
    If the partialReturn property is true, only the amount of text that
    can be returned without creating a copy is returned. Using partial
    returns will give better performance for situations where large
    parts of the document are being scanned. The following is an example
    of using the partial return to access the entire document:

    ```
       int nleft = doc.getDocumentLength();
       Segment text = new Segment();
       int offs = 0;
       text.setPartialReturn(true);
       while (nleft > 0) {
           doc.getText(offs, nleft, text);
           // do something with text
           nleft -= text.count;
           offs += text.count;
       }
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `offset` - the offset into the document representing the desired
        start of the text >= 0
    :   `length` - the length of the desired string >= 0
    :   `txt` - the Segment object to return the text in

    Throws:
    :   `BadLocationException` - Some portion of the given range
        was not a valid part of the document. The location in the exception
        is the first bad position encountered.
  + ### getStartPosition

    [Position](Position.md "interface in javax.swing.text") getStartPosition()

    Returns a position that represents the start of the document. The
    position returned can be counted on to track change and stay
    located at the beginning of the document.

    Returns:
    :   the position
  + ### getEndPosition

    [Position](Position.md "interface in javax.swing.text") getEndPosition()

    Returns a position that represents the end of the document. The
    position returned can be counted on to track change and stay
    located at the end of the document.

    Returns:
    :   the position
  + ### createPosition

    [Position](Position.md "interface in javax.swing.text") createPosition(int offs)
    throws [BadLocationException](BadLocationException.md "class in javax.swing.text")

    This method allows an application to mark a place in
    a sequence of character content. This mark can then be
    used to tracks change as insertions and removals are made
    in the content. The policy is that insertions always
    occur prior to the current position (the most common case)
    unless the insertion location is zero, in which case the
    insertion is forced to a position that follows the
    original position.

    Parameters:
    :   `offs` - the offset from the start of the document >= 0

    Returns:
    :   the position

    Throws:
    :   `BadLocationException` - if the given position does not
        represent a valid location in the associated document
  + ### getRootElements

    [Element](Element.md "interface in javax.swing.text")[] getRootElements()

    Returns all of the root elements that are defined.

    Typically there will be only one document structure, but the interface
    supports building an arbitrary number of structural projections over the
    text data. The document can have multiple root elements to support
    multiple document structures. Some examples might be:

    - Text direction.- Lexical token streams.- Parse trees.- Conversions to formats other than the native format.- Modification specifications.- Annotations.

    Returns:
    :   the root element
  + ### getDefaultRootElement

    [Element](Element.md "interface in javax.swing.text") getDefaultRootElement()

    Returns the root element that views should be based upon,
    unless some other mechanism for assigning views to element
    structures is provided.

    Returns:
    :   the root element
  + ### render

    void render([Runnable](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Runnable.md "interface in java.lang") r)

    Allows the model to be safely rendered in the presence
    of concurrency, if the model supports being updated asynchronously.
    The given runnable will be executed in a way that allows it
    to safely read the model with no changes while the runnable
    is being executed. The runnable itself may *not*
    make any mutations.

    Parameters:
    :   `r` - a `Runnable` used to render the model
