# Class FlowView.FlowStrategy

[java.lang.Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

javax.swing.text.FlowView.FlowStrategy

Enclosing class:
:   `FlowView`

---

public static class FlowView.FlowStrategy
extends [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

Strategy for maintaining the physical form
of the flow. The default implementation is
completely stateless, and recalculates the
entire flow if the layout is invalid on the
given FlowView. Alternative strategies can
be implemented by subclassing, and might
perform incremental repair to the layout
or alternative breaking behavior.

Since:
:   1.3

  + ### insertUpdate

    public void insertUpdate([FlowView](FlowView.md "class in javax.swing.text") fv,
    [DocumentEvent](../event/DocumentEvent.md "interface in javax.swing.event") e,
    [Rectangle](../../../java/awt/Rectangle.md "class in java.awt") alloc)

    Gives notification that something was inserted into the document
    in a location that the given flow view is responsible for. The
    strategy should update the appropriate changed region (which
    depends upon the strategy used for repair).

    Parameters:
    :   `fv` - the flow view
    :   `e` - the change information from the associated document
    :   `alloc` - the current allocation of the view inside of the insets.
        This value will be null if the view has not yet been displayed.

  + ### removeUpdate

    public void removeUpdate([FlowView](FlowView.md "class in javax.swing.text") fv,
    [DocumentEvent](../event/DocumentEvent.md "interface in javax.swing.event") e,
    [Rectangle](../../../java/awt/Rectangle.md "class in java.awt") alloc)

    Gives notification that something was removed from the document
    in a location that the given flow view is responsible for.

    Parameters:
    :   `fv` - the flow view
    :   `e` - the change information from the associated document
    :   `alloc` - the current allocation of the view inside of the insets.

  + ### changedUpdate

    public void changedUpdate([FlowView](FlowView.md "class in javax.swing.text") fv,
    [DocumentEvent](../event/DocumentEvent.md "interface in javax.swing.event") e,
    [Rectangle](../../../java/awt/Rectangle.md "class in java.awt") alloc)

    Gives notification from the document that attributes were changed
    in a location that this view is responsible for.

    Parameters:
    :   `fv` - the `FlowView` containing the changes
    :   `e` - the `DocumentEvent` describing the changes
        done to the Document
    :   `alloc` - Bounds of the View

    See Also:
    :   - [`View.changedUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)`](View.md#changedUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent,java.awt.Shape,javax.swing.text.ViewFactory))
  + ### getLogicalView

    protected [View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") getLogicalView([FlowView](FlowView.md "class in javax.swing.text") fv)

    This method gives flow strategies access to the logical
    view of the FlowView.

    Parameters:
    :   `fv` - the FlowView

    Returns:
    :   the logical view of the FlowView
  + ### layout

    public void layout([FlowView](FlowView.md "class in javax.swing.text") fv)

    Update the flow on the given FlowView. By default, this causes
    all of the rows (child views) to be rebuilt to match the given
    constraints for each row. This is called by a FlowView.layout
    to update the child views in the flow.

    Parameters:
    :   `fv` - the view to reflow
  + ### layoutRow

    protected int layoutRow([FlowView](FlowView.md "class in javax.swing.text") fv,
    int rowIndex,
    int pos)

    Creates a row of views that will fit within the
    layout span of the row. This is called by the layout method.
    This is implemented to fill the row by repeatedly calling
    the createView method until the available span has been
    exhausted, a forced break was encountered, or the createView
    method returned null. If the remaining span was exhausted,
    the adjustRow method will be called to perform adjustments
    to the row to try and make it fit into the given span.

    Parameters:
    :   `fv` - the flow view
    :   `rowIndex` - the index of the row to fill in with views. The
        row is assumed to be empty on entry.
    :   `pos` - The current position in the children of
        this views element from which to start.

    Returns:
    :   the position to start the next row
  + ### adjustRow

    protected void adjustRow([FlowView](FlowView.md "class in javax.swing.text") fv,
    int rowIndex,
    int desiredSpan,
    int x)

    Adjusts the given row if possible to fit within the
    layout span. By default this will try to find the
    highest break weight possible nearest the end of
    the row. If a forced break is encountered, the
    break will be positioned there.

    Parameters:
    :   `fv` - the flow view
    :   `rowIndex` - the row to adjust to the current layout
        span.
    :   `desiredSpan` - the current layout span >= 0
    :   `x` - the location r starts at.
  + ### createView

    protected [View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") createView([FlowView](FlowView.md "class in javax.swing.text") fv,
    int startOffset,
    int spanLeft,
    int rowIndex)

    Creates a view that can be used to represent the current piece
    of the flow. This can be either an entire view from the
    logical view, or a fragment of the logical view.

    Parameters:
    :   `fv` - the view holding the flow
    :   `startOffset` - the start location for the view being created
    :   `spanLeft` - the about of span left to fill in the row
    :   `rowIndex` - the row the view will be placed into

    Returns:
    :   a view that can be used to represent the current piece
        of the flow
