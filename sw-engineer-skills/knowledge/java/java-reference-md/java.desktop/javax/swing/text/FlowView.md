public abstract class FlowView
extends [BoxView](BoxView.md "class in javax.swing.text")

A View that tries to flow it's children into some
partially constrained space. This can be used to
build things like paragraphs, pages, etc. The
flow is made up of the following pieces of functionality.

* A logical set of child views, which as used as a
  layout pool from which a physical view is formed.* A strategy for translating the logical view to
    a physical (flowed) view.* Constraints for the strategy to work against.* A physical structure, that represents the flow.
        The children of this view are where the pieces of
        of the logical views are placed to create the flow.

Since:
:   1.3

  + ### layoutSpan

    protected int layoutSpan

    Default constraint against which the flow is
    created against.
  + ### layoutPool

    protected [View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") layoutPool

    These are the views that represent the child elements
    of the element this view represents (The logical view
    to translate to a physical view). These are not
    directly children of this view. These are either
    placed into the rows directly or used for the purpose
    of breaking into smaller chunks, to form the physical
    view.
  + ### strategy

    protected [FlowView.FlowStrategy](FlowView.FlowStrategy.md "class in javax.swing.text") strategy

    The behavior for keeping the flow updated. By
    default this is a singleton shared by all instances
    of FlowView (FlowStrategy is stateless). Subclasses
    can create an alternative strategy, which might keep
    state.
* ## Constructor Details

  + ### FlowView

    public FlowView([Element](Element.md "interface in javax.swing.text") elem,
    int axis)

    Constructs a FlowView for the given element.

    Parameters:
    :   `elem` - the element that this view is responsible for
    :   `axis` - may be either View.X\_AXIS or View.Y\_AXIS
* ## Method Details

  + ### getFlowAxis

    public int getFlowAxis()

    Fetches the axis along which views should be
    flowed. By default, this will be the axis
    orthogonal to the axis along which the flow
    rows are tiled (the axis of the default flow
    rows themselves). This is typically used
    by the `FlowStrategy`.

    Returns:
    :   the axis along which views should be
        flowed
  + ### getFlowSpan

    public int getFlowSpan(int index)

    Fetch the constraining span to flow against for
    the given child index. This is called by the
    FlowStrategy while it is updating the flow.
    A flow can be shaped by providing different values
    for the row constraints. By default, the entire
    span inside of the insets along the flow axis
    is returned.

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - the index of the row being updated.
        This should be a value >= 0 and < getViewCount().

    Returns:
    :   the constraining span to flow against for
        the given child index

    See Also:
    :   - [`getFlowStart(int)`](#getFlowStart(int))
  + ### getFlowStart

    public int getFlowStart(int index)

    Fetch the location along the flow axis that the
    flow span will start at. This is called by the
    FlowStrategy while it is updating the flow.
    A flow can be shaped by providing different values
    for the row constraints.

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - the index of the row being updated.
        This should be a value >= 0 and < getViewCount().

    Returns:
    :   the location along the flow axis that the
        flow span will start at

    See Also:
    :   - [`getFlowSpan(int)`](#getFlowSpan(int))
  + ### createRow

    protected abstract [View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") createRow()

    Create a View that should be used to hold a
    a rows worth of children in a flow. This is
    called by the FlowStrategy when new children
    are added or removed (i.e. rows are added or
    removed) in the process of updating the flow.

    Returns:
    :   a View that should be used to hold a
        a rows worth of children in a flow
  + ### loadChildren

    protected void loadChildren([ViewFactory](ViewFactory.md "interface in javax.swing.text") f)

    Loads all of the children to initialize the view.
    This is called by the `setParent` method.
    This is reimplemented to not load any children directly
    (as they are created in the process of formatting).
    If the layoutPool variable is null, an instance of
    LogicalView is created to represent the logical view
    that is used in the process of formatting.

    Overrides:
    :   `loadChildren` in class `CompositeView`

    Parameters:
    :   `f` - the view factory

    See Also:
    :   - [`CompositeView.setParent(javax.swing.text.View)`](CompositeView.md#setParent(javax.swing.text.View))
  + ### getViewIndexAtPosition

    protected int getViewIndexAtPosition(int pos)

    Fetches the child view index representing the given position in
    the model.

    Overrides:
    :   `getViewIndexAtPosition` in class `CompositeView`

    Parameters:
    :   `pos` - the position >= 0

    Returns:
    :   index of the view representing the given position, or
        -1 if no view represents that position
  + ### layout

    protected void layout(int width,
    int height)

    Lays out the children. If the span along the flow
    axis has changed, layout is marked as invalid which
    which will cause the superclass behavior to recalculate
    the layout along the box axis. The FlowStrategy.layout
    method will be called to rebuild the flow rows as
    appropriate. If the height of this view changes
    (determined by the preferred size along the box axis),
    a preferenceChanged is called. Following all of that,
    the normal box layout of the superclass is performed.

    Overrides:
    :   `layout` in class `BoxView`

    Parameters:
    :   `width` - the width to lay out against >= 0. This is
        the width inside of the inset area.
    :   `height` - the height to lay out against >= 0 This
        is the height inside of the inset area.
  + ### calculateMinorAxisRequirements

    protected [SizeRequirements](../SizeRequirements.md "class in javax.swing") calculateMinorAxisRequirements(int axis,
    [SizeRequirements](../SizeRequirements.md "class in javax.swing") r)

    Calculate requirements along the minor axis. This
    is implemented to forward the request to the logical
    view by calling getMinimumSpan, getPreferredSpan, and
    getMaximumSpan on it.

    Overrides:
    :   `calculateMinorAxisRequirements` in class `BoxView`

    Parameters:
    :   `axis` - the axis being studied
    :   `r` - the `SizeRequirements` object;
        if `null` one will be created

    Returns:
    :   the newly initialized `SizeRequirements` object

    See Also:
    :   - [`SizeRequirements`](../SizeRequirements.md "class in javax.swing")
  + ### insertUpdate

    public void insertUpdate([DocumentEvent](../event/DocumentEvent.md "interface in javax.swing.event") changes,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") a,
    [ViewFactory](ViewFactory.md "interface in javax.swing.text") f)

    Gives notification that something was inserted into the document
    in a location that this view is responsible for.

    Overrides:
    :   `insertUpdate` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `changes` - the change information from the associated document
    :   `a` - the current allocation of the view
    :   `f` - the factory to use to rebuild if the view has children

    See Also:
    :   - [`View.insertUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)`](View.md#insertUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent,java.awt.Shape,javax.swing.text.ViewFactory))
  + ### removeUpdate

    public void removeUpdate([DocumentEvent](../event/DocumentEvent.md "interface in javax.swing.event") changes,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") a,
    [ViewFactory](ViewFactory.md "interface in javax.swing.text") f)

    Gives notification that something was removed from the document
    in a location that this view is responsible for.

    Overrides:
    :   `removeUpdate` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `changes` - the change information from the associated document
    :   `a` - the current allocation of the view
    :   `f` - the factory to use to rebuild if the view has children

    See Also:
    :   - [`View.removeUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)`](View.md#removeUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent,java.awt.Shape,javax.swing.text.ViewFactory))
  + ### changedUpdate

    public void changedUpdate([DocumentEvent](../event/DocumentEvent.md "interface in javax.swing.event") changes,
    [Shape](../../../java/awt/Shape.md "interface in java.awt") a,
    [ViewFactory](ViewFactory.md "interface in javax.swing.text") f)

    Gives notification from the document that attributes were changed
    in a location that this view is responsible for.

    Overrides:
    :   `changedUpdate` in class `View`

    Parameters:
    :   `changes` - the change information from the associated document
    :   `a` - the current allocation of the view
    :   `f` - the factory to use to rebuild if the view has children

    See Also:
    :   - [`View.changedUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent, java.awt.Shape, javax.swing.text.ViewFactory)`](View.md#changedUpdate(javax.swing.event.DocumentEvent,java.awt.Shape,javax.swing.text.ViewFactory))
  + ### setParent

    public void setParent([View](View.md "class in javax.swing.text") parent)

    Sets the parent of the view.
    This is reimplemented to provide the superclass
    behavior as well as calling the `loadChildren`
    method if this view does not already have children.
    The children should not be loaded in the
    constructor because the act of setting the parent
    may cause them to try to search up the hierarchy
    (to get the hosting `Container` for example).
    If this view has children (the view is being moved
    from one place in the view hierarchy to another),
    the `loadChildren` method will not be called.

    Overrides:
    :   `setParent` in class `CompositeView`

    Parameters:
    :   `parent` - the parent of the view, `null` if none
