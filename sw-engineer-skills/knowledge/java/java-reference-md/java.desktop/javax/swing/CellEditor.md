# Interface CellEditor

All Known Subinterfaces:
:   `TableCellEditor`, `TreeCellEditor`

All Known Implementing Classes:
:   `AbstractCellEditor`, `DefaultCellEditor`, `DefaultTreeCellEditor`

---

public interface CellEditor

This interface defines the methods any general editor should be able
to implement.

Having this interface enables complex components (the client of the
editor) such as `JTree` and
`JTable` to allow any generic editor to
edit values in a table cell, or tree cell, etc. Without this generic
editor interface, `JTable` would have to know about specific editors,
such as `JTextField`, `JCheckBox`, `JComboBox`,
etc. In addition, without this interface, clients of editors such as
`JTable` would not be able
to work with any editors developed in the future by the user
or a 3rd party ISV.

To use this interface, a developer creating a new editor can have the
new component implement the interface. Or the developer can
choose a wrapper based approach and provide a companion object which
implements the `CellEditor` interface (See
`DefaultCellEditor` for example). The wrapper approach
is particularly useful if the user want to use a 3rd party ISV
editor with `JTable`, but the ISV didn't implement the
`CellEditor` interface. The user can simply create an object
that contains an instance of the 3rd party editor object and "translate"
the `CellEditor` API into the 3rd party editor's API.

  edited value.

  `Object`

  `getCellEditorValue()`

  Returns the value contained in the editor.

  `boolean`

  `isCellEditable(EventObject anEvent)`

  Asks the editor if it can start editing using `anEvent`.

  `void`

  `removeCellEditorListener(CellEditorListener l)`

  Removes a listener from the list that's notified

  `boolean`

  `shouldSelectCell(EventObject anEvent)`

  Returns true if the editing cell should be selected, false otherwise.

  `boolean`

  `stopCellEditing()`

  Tells the editor to stop editing and accept any partially edited
  value as the value of the editor.

* ## Method Details

  + ### getCellEditorValue

    [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") getCellEditorValue()

    Returns the value contained in the editor.

    Returns:
    :   the value contained in the editor
  + ### isCellEditable

    boolean isCellEditable([EventObject](../../../java.base/java/util/EventObject.md "class in java.util") anEvent)

    Asks the editor if it can start editing using `anEvent`.
    `anEvent` is in the invoking component coordinate system.
    The editor can not assume the Component returned by
    `getCellEditorComponent` is installed. This method
    is intended for the use of client to avoid the cost of setting up
    and installing the editor component if editing is not possible.
    If editing can be started this method returns true.

    Parameters:
    :   `anEvent` - the event the editor should use to consider
        whether to begin editing or not

    Returns:
    :   true if editing can be started

    See Also:
    :   - [`shouldSelectCell(java.util.EventObject)`](#shouldSelectCell(java.util.EventObject))
  + ### shouldSelectCell

    boolean shouldSelectCell([EventObject](../../../java.base/java/util/EventObject.md "class in java.util") anEvent)

    Returns true if the editing cell should be selected, false otherwise.
    Typically, the return value is true, because is most cases the editing
    cell should be selected. However, it is useful to return false to
    keep the selection from changing for some types of edits.
    eg. A table that contains a column of check boxes, the user might
    want to be able to change those checkboxes without altering the
    selection. (See Netscape Communicator for just such an example)
    Of course, it is up to the client of the editor to use the return
    value, but it doesn't need to if it doesn't want to.

    Parameters:
    :   `anEvent` - the event the editor should use to start
        editing

    Returns:
    :   true if the editor would like the editing cell to be selected;
        otherwise returns false

    See Also:
    :   - [`isCellEditable(java.util.EventObject)`](#isCellEditable(java.util.EventObject))
  + ### stopCellEditing

    boolean stopCellEditing()

    Tells the editor to stop editing and accept any partially edited
    value as the value of the editor. The editor returns false if
    editing was not stopped; this is useful for editors that validate
    and can not accept invalid entries.

    Returns:
    :   true if editing was stopped; false otherwise
  + ### cancelCellEditing

    void cancelCellEditing()

    Tells the editor to cancel editing and not accept any partially
    edited value.
  + ### addCellEditorListener

    void addCellEditorListener([CellEditorListener](event/CellEditorListener.md "interface in javax.swing.event") l)

    Adds a listener to the list that's notified when the editor
    stops, or cancels editing.

    Parameters:
    :   `l` - the CellEditorListener
  + ### removeCellEditorListener

    void removeCellEditorListener([CellEditorListener](event/CellEditorListener.md "interface in javax.swing.event") l)

    Removes a listener from the list that's notified

    Parameters:
    :   `l` - the CellEditorListener
