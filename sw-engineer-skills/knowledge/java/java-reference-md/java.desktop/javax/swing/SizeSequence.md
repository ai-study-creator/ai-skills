javax.swing.SizeSequence

---

public class SizeSequence
extends [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

A `SizeSequence` object
efficiently maintains an ordered list
of sizes and corresponding positions.
One situation for which `SizeSequence`
might be appropriate is in a component
that displays multiple rows of unequal size.
In this case, a single `SizeSequence`
object could be used to track the heights
and Y positions of all rows.

Another example would be a multi-column component,
such as a `JTable`,
in which the column sizes are not all equal.
The `JTable` might use a single
`SizeSequence` object
to store the widths and X positions of all the columns.
The `JTable` could then use the
`SizeSequence` object
to find the column corresponding to a certain position.
The `JTable` could update the
`SizeSequence` object
whenever one or more column sizes changed.

The following figure shows the relationship between size and position data
for a multi-column component.

![The first item begins at position 0, the second at the position equal
 to the size of the previous item, and so on.](doc-files/SizeSequence-1.gif)

In the figure, the first index (0) corresponds to the first column,
the second index (1) to the second column, and so on.
The first column's position starts at 0,
and the column occupies *size0* pixels,
where *size0* is the value returned by
`getSize(0)`.
Thus, the first column ends at *size0* - 1.
The second column then begins at
the position *size0*
and occupies *size1* (`getSize(1)`) pixels.

Note that a `SizeSequence` object simply represents intervals
along an axis.
In our examples, the intervals represent height or width in pixels.
However, any other unit of measure (for example, time in days)
could be just as valid.

## Implementation Notes

Normally when storing the size and position of entries,
one would choose between
storing the sizes or storing their positions
instead. The two common operations that are needed during
rendering are: `getIndex(position)`
and `setSize(index, size)`.
Whichever choice of internal format is made one of these
operations is costly when the number of entries becomes large.
If sizes are stored, finding the index of the entry
that encloses a particular position is linear in the
number of entries. If positions are stored instead, setting
the size of an entry at a particular index requires updating
the positions of the affected entries, which is also a linear
calculation.

Like the above techniques this class holds an array of N integers
internally but uses a hybrid encoding, which is halfway
between the size-based and positional-based approaches.
The result is a data structure that takes the same space to store
the information but can perform most operations in Log(N) time
instead of O(N), where N is the number of entries in the list.

Two operations that remain O(N) in the number of entries are
the `insertEntries`
and `removeEntries` methods, both
of which are implemented by converting the internal array to
a set of integer sizes, copying it into the new array, and then
reforming the hybrid representation in place.

* ## Constructor Details

  + ### SizeSequence

    public SizeSequence()

    Creates a new `SizeSequence` object
    that contains no entries. To add entries, you
    can use `insertEntries` or `setSizes`.

    See Also:
    :   - [`insertEntries(int, int, int)`](#insertEntries(int,int,int))
        - [`setSizes(int[])`](#setSizes(int%5B%5D))
  + ### SizeSequence

    public SizeSequence(int numEntries)

    Creates a new `SizeSequence` object
    that contains the specified number of entries,
    all initialized to have size 0.

    Parameters:
    :   `numEntries` - the number of sizes to track

    Throws:
    :   `NegativeArraySizeException` - if
        `numEntries < 0`
  + ### SizeSequence

    public SizeSequence(int numEntries,
    int value)

    Creates a new `SizeSequence` object
    that contains the specified number of entries,
    all initialized to have size `value`.

    Parameters:
    :   `numEntries` - the number of sizes to track
    :   `value` - the initial value of each size
  + ### SizeSequence

    public SizeSequence(int[] sizes)

    Creates a new `SizeSequence` object
    that contains the specified sizes.

    Parameters:
    :   `sizes` - the array of sizes to be contained in
        the `SizeSequence`
* ## Method Details

  + ### setSizes

    public void setSizes(int[] sizes)

    Resets this `SizeSequence` object,
    using the data in the `sizes` argument.
    This method reinitializes this object so that it
    contains as many entries as the `sizes` array.
    Each entry's size is initialized to the value of the
    corresponding item in `sizes`.

    Parameters:
    :   `sizes` - the array of sizes to be contained in
        this `SizeSequence`
  + ### getSizes

    public int[] getSizes()

    Returns the size of all entries.

    Returns:
    :   a new array containing the sizes in this object
  + ### getPosition

    public int getPosition(int index)

    Returns the start position for the specified entry.
    For example, `getPosition(0)` returns 0,
    `getPosition(1)` is equal to
    `getSize(0)`,
    `getPosition(2)` is equal to
    `getSize(0)` + `getSize(1)`,
    and so on.

    Note that if `index` is greater than
    `length` the value returned may
    be meaningless.

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - the index of the entry whose position is desired

    Returns:
    :   the starting position of the specified entry
  + ### getIndex

    public int getIndex(int position)

    Returns the index of the entry
    that corresponds to the specified position.
    For example, `getIndex(0)` is 0,
    since the first entry always starts at position 0.

    Parameters:
    :   `position` - the position of the entry

    Returns:
    :   the index of the entry that occupies the specified position
  + ### getSize

    public int getSize(int index)

    Returns the size of the specified entry.
    If `index` is out of the range
    `(0 <= index < getSizes().length)`
    the behavior is unspecified.

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - the index corresponding to the entry

    Returns:
    :   the size of the entry
  + ### setSize

    public void setSize(int index,
    int size)

    Sets the size of the specified entry.
    Note that if the value of `index`
    does not fall in the range:
    `(0 <= index < getSizes().length)`
    the behavior is unspecified.

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - the index corresponding to the entry
    :   `size` - the size of the entry
  + ### insertEntries

    public void insertEntries(int start,
    int length,
    int value)

    Adds a contiguous group of entries to this `SizeSequence`.
    Note that the values of `start` and
    `length` must satisfy the following
    conditions: `(0 <= start < getSizes().length)
    AND (length >= 0)`. If these conditions are
    not met, the behavior is unspecified and an exception
    may be thrown.

    Parameters:
    :   `start` - the index to be assigned to the first entry
        in the group
    :   `length` - the number of entries in the group
    :   `value` - the size to be assigned to each new entry

    Throws:
    :   `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` - if the parameters
        are outside of the range:
        (`0 <= start < (getSizes().length)) AND (length >= 0)`
  + ### removeEntries

    public void removeEntries(int start,
    int length)

    Removes a contiguous group of entries
    from this `SizeSequence`.
    Note that the values of `start` and
    `length` must satisfy the following
    conditions: `(0 <= start < getSizes().length)
    AND (length >= 0)`. If these conditions are
    not met, the behavior is unspecified and an exception
    may be thrown.

    Parameters:
