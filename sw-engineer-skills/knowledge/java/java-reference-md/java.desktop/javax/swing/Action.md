public interface Action
extends [ActionListener](../../java/awt/event/ActionListener.md "interface in java.awt.event")

The `Action` interface provides a useful extension to the
`ActionListener`
interface in cases where the same functionality may be accessed by
several controls.

In addition to the `actionPerformed` method defined by the
`ActionListener` interface, this interface allows the
application to define, in a single place:

* One or more text strings that describe the function. These strings
  can be used, for example, to display the flyover text for a button
  or to set the text in a menu item.* One or more icons that depict the function. These icons can be used
    for the images in a menu control, or for composite entries in a more
    sophisticated user interface.* The enabled/disabled state of the functionality. Instead of having
      to separately disable the menu item and the toolbar button, the
      application can disable the function that implements this interface.
      All components which are registered as listeners for the state change
      then know to disable event generation for that item and to modify the
      display accordingly.

This interface can be added to an existing class or used to create an
adapter (typically, by subclassing `AbstractAction`).
The `Action` object
can then be added to multiple `Action`-aware containers
and connected to `Action`-capable
components. The GUI controls can then be activated or
deactivated all at once by invoking the `Action` object's
`setEnabled` method.

Note that `Action` implementations tend to be more expensive
in terms of storage than a typical `ActionListener`,
which does not offer the benefits of centralized control of
functionality and broadcast of property changes. For this reason,
you should take care to only use `Action`s where their benefits
are desired, and use simple `ActionListener`s elsewhere.
  

## Swing Components Supporting `Action`

Many of Swing's components have an `Action` property. When
an `Action` is set on a component, the following things
happen:

* The `Action` is added as an `ActionListener` to
  the component.* The component configures some of its properties to match the
    `Action`.* The component installs a `PropertyChangeListener` on the
      `Action` so that the component can change its properties
      to reflect changes in the `Action`'s properties.

The following table describes the properties used by
`Swing` components that support `Actions`.
In the table, *button* refers to any
`AbstractButton` subclass, which includes not only
`JButton` but also classes such as
`JMenuItem`. Unless otherwise stated, a
`null` property value in an `Action` (or a
`Action` that is `null`) results in the
button's corresponding property being set to `null`.

Supported Action properties

| Component Property Components Action Key Notes | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` All The `isEnabled` method |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `toolTipText` All `SHORT_DESCRIPTION` |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `actionCommand` All `ACTION_COMMAND_KEY` |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `mnemonic` All buttons `MNEMONIC_KEY` A `null` value or `Action` results in the button's `mnemonic` property being set to `'\0'`.| `text` All buttons `NAME` If you do not want the text of the button to mirror that of the `Action`, set the property `hideActionText` to `true`. If `hideActionText` is `true`, setting the `Action` changes the text of the button to `null` and any changes to `NAME` are ignored. `hideActionText` is useful for tool bar buttons that typically only show an `Icon`. `JToolBar.add(Action)` sets the property to `true` if the `Action` has a non-`null` value for `LARGE_ICON_KEY` or `SMALL_ICON`.| `displayedMnemonicIndex` All buttons `DISPLAYED_MNEMONIC_INDEX_KEY` If the value of `DISPLAYED_MNEMONIC_INDEX_KEY` is beyond the bounds of the text, it is ignored. When `setAction` is called, if the value from the `Action` is `null`, the displayed mnemonic index is not updated. In any subsequent changes to `DISPLAYED_MNEMONIC_INDEX_KEY`, `null` is treated as -1.| `icon` All buttons except of `JCheckBox`, `JToggleButton` and `JRadioButton`. either `LARGE_ICON_KEY` or `SMALL_ICON` The `JMenuItem` subclasses only use `SMALL_ICON`. All other buttons will use `LARGE_ICON_KEY`; if the value is `null` they use `SMALL_ICON`.| `accelerator` All `JMenuItem` subclasses, with the exception of `JMenu`. `ACCELERATOR_KEY` |  |  |  |  | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | `selected` `JToggleButton`, `JCheckBox`, `JRadioButton`, `JCheckBoxMenuItem` and `JRadioButtonMenuItem` `SELECTED_KEY` Components that honor this property only use the value if it is `non-null`. For example, if you set an `Action` that has a `null` value for `SELECTED_KEY` on a `JToggleButton`, the `JToggleButton` will not update it's selected state in any way. Similarly, any time the `JToggleButton`'s selected state changes it will only set the value back on the `Action` if the `Action` has a `non-null` value for `SELECTED_KEY`.   Components that honor this property keep their selected state in sync with this property. When the same `Action` is used with multiple components, all the components keep their selected state in sync with this property. Mutually exclusive buttons, such as `JToggleButton`s in a `ButtonGroup`, force only one of the buttons to be selected. As such, do not use the same `Action` that defines a value for the `SELECTED_KEY` property with multiple mutually exclusive buttons. | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

`JPopupMenu`, `JToolBar` and `JMenu`
all provide convenience methods for creating a component and setting the
`Action` on the corresponding component. Refer to each of
these classes for more information.

`Action` uses `PropertyChangeListener` to
inform listeners the `Action` has changed. The beans
specification indicates that a `null` property name can
be used to indicate multiple values have changed. By default Swing
components that take an `Action` do not handle such a
change. To indicate that Swing should treat `null`
according to the beans specification set the system property
`swing.actions.reconfigureOnNull` to the `String`
value `true`.

    commonly used to specify a mnemonic. For example:
    `myAction.putValue(Action.MNEMONIC_KEY, KeyEvent.VK_A)`
    sets the mnemonic of `myAction` to 'a', while
    `myAction.putValue(Action.MNEMONIC_KEY, KeyEvent.getExtendedKeyCodeForChar('ф'))`

  + ### SELECTED\_KEY

    static final [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") SELECTED\_KEY

    The key used for storing a `Boolean` that corresponds
    to the selected state. This is typically used only for components
    that have a meaningful selection state. For example,
    `JRadioButton` and `JCheckBox` make use of
    this but instances of `JMenu` don't.

    This property differs from the others in that it is both read
    by the component and set by the component. For example,
    if an `Action` is attached to a `JCheckBox`
    the selected state of the `JCheckBox` will be set from
    that of the `Action`. If the user clicks on the
    `JCheckBox` the selected state of the `JCheckBox`
    **and** the `Action` will **both** be updated.

    avoid possible collisions with existing `Actions`.

    The key used for storing an `Integer` that corresponds
    to the index in the text (identified by the `NAME`
    property) that the decoration for a mnemonic should be rendered at. If
    the value of this property is greater than or equal to the length of
    the text, it will treated as -1.

    The key used for storing an `Icon`. This is typically

    `JToggleButton`.

    If the same `Action` is used with menus and buttons you'll
    typically specify both a `SMALL_ICON` and a
    `LARGE_ICON_KEY`. The menu will use the
    `SMALL_ICON` and the button the `LARGE_ICON_KEY`.
