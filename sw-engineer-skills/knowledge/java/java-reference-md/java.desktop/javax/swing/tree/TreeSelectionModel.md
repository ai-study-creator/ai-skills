# Interface TreeSelectionModel

All Known Implementing Classes:
:   `DefaultTreeSelectionModel`, `JTree.EmptySelectionModel`

---

public interface TreeSelectionModel

This interface represents the current state of the selection for
the tree component.
For information and examples of using tree selection models,
see [How to Use Trees](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/tree.html)
in *The Java Tutorial.*

The state of the tree selection is characterized by
a set of TreePaths, and optionally a set of integers. The mapping
from TreePath to integer is done by way of an instance of RowMapper.
It is not necessary for a TreeSelectionModel to have a RowMapper to
correctly operate, but without a RowMapper `getSelectionRows`
will return null.

A TreeSelectionModel can be configured to allow only one
path (`SINGLE_TREE_SELECTION`) a number of
contiguous paths (`CONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION`) or a number of
discontiguous paths (`DISCONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION`).
A `RowMapper` is used to determine if TreePaths are
contiguous.
In the absence of a RowMapper `CONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION` and
`DISCONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION` behave the same, that is they
allow any number of paths to be contained in the TreeSelectionModel.

For a selection model of `CONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION` any
time the paths are changed (`setSelectionPath`,
`addSelectionPath` ...) the TreePaths are again checked to
make they are contiguous. A check of the TreePaths can also be forced
by invoking `resetRowSelection`. How a set of discontiguous
TreePaths is mapped to a contiguous set is left to implementors of
this interface to enforce a particular policy.

Implementations should combine duplicate TreePaths that are
added to the selection. For example, the following code

```
   TreePath[] paths = new TreePath[] { treePath, treePath };
   treeSelectionModel.setSelectionPaths(paths);
```

should result in only one path being selected:
`treePath`, and
not two copies of `treePath`.

The lead TreePath is the last path that was added (or set). The lead
row is then the row that corresponds to the TreePath as determined
from the RowMapper.

* ## Field Details

  + ### SINGLE\_TREE\_SELECTION

    static final int SINGLE\_TREE\_SELECTION

    Selection can only contain one path at a time.

    See Also:
    :   - [Constant Field Values](../../../../constant-values.md#javax.swing.tree.TreeSelectionModel.SINGLE_TREE_SELECTION)
  + ### CONTIGUOUS\_TREE\_SELECTION

    static final int CONTIGUOUS\_TREE\_SELECTION

    Selection can only be contiguous. This will only be enforced if
    a RowMapper instance is provided. That is, if no RowMapper is set
    this behaves the same as DISCONTIGUOUS\_TREE\_SELECTION.

    See Also:
    :   - [Constant Field Values](../../../../constant-values.md#javax.swing.tree.TreeSelectionModel.CONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION)
  + ### DISCONTIGUOUS\_TREE\_SELECTION

    static final int DISCONTIGUOUS\_TREE\_SELECTION

    Selection can contain any number of items that are not necessarily
    contiguous.

    See Also:
    :   - [Constant Field Values](../../../../constant-values.md#javax.swing.tree.TreeSelectionModel.DISCONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION)
* ## Method Details

  + ### setSelectionMode

    void setSelectionMode(int mode)

    Sets the selection model, which must be one of SINGLE\_TREE\_SELECTION,
    CONTIGUOUS\_TREE\_SELECTION or DISCONTIGUOUS\_TREE\_SELECTION.

    This may change the selection if the current selection is not valid
    for the new mode. For example, if three TreePaths are
    selected when the mode is changed to `SINGLE_TREE_SELECTION`,
    only one TreePath will remain selected. It is up to the particular
    implementation to decide what TreePath remains selected.

    Parameters:
    :   `mode` - selection mode to be set
  + ### getSelectionMode

    int getSelectionMode()

    Returns the current selection mode, one of
    `SINGLE_TREE_SELECTION`,
    `CONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION` or
    `DISCONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION`.

    Returns:
    :   the current selection mode
  + ### setSelectionPath

    void setSelectionPath([TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree") path)

    Sets the selection to path. If this represents a change, then
    the TreeSelectionListeners are notified. If `path` is
    null, this has the same effect as invoking `clearSelection`.

    Parameters:
    :   `path` - new path to select
  + ### setSelectionPaths

    void setSelectionPaths([TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree")[] paths)

    Sets the selection to path. If this represents a change, then
    the TreeSelectionListeners are notified. If `paths` is
    null, this has the same effect as invoking `clearSelection`.

    Parameters:
    :   `paths` - new selection
  + ### addSelectionPath

    void addSelectionPath([TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree") path)

    Adds path to the current selection. If path is not currently
    in the selection the TreeSelectionListeners are notified. This has
    no effect if `path` is null.

    Parameters:
    :   `path` - the new path to add to the current selection
  + ### addSelectionPaths

    void addSelectionPaths([TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree")[] paths)

    Adds paths to the current selection. If any of the paths in
    paths are not currently in the selection the TreeSelectionListeners
    are notified. This has
    no effect if `paths` is null.

    Parameters:
    :   `paths` - the new paths to add to the current selection
  + ### removeSelectionPath

    void removeSelectionPath([TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree") path)

    Removes path from the selection. If path is in the selection
    The TreeSelectionListeners are notified. This has no effect if
    `path` is null.

    Parameters:
    :   `path` - the path to remove from the selection
  + ### removeSelectionPaths

    void removeSelectionPaths([TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree")[] paths)

    `paths`
    are in the selection, the TreeSelectionListeners are notified.
    This method has no effect if `paths` is null.

    Parameters:
    :   `paths` - the path to remove from the selection
  + ### getSelectionPath

    [TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree") getSelectionPath()

    up to implementors, and may not necessarily be the TreePath with
    the smallest integer value as determined from the
    `RowMapper`.

    Returns:
    :   the first path in the selection
  + ### getSelectionPaths

    [TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree")[] getSelectionPaths()

    empty array) if nothing is currently selected.

    Returns:
    :   the paths in the selection
  + ### getSelectionCount

    int getSelectionCount()

    Returns the number of paths that are selected.

    Returns:
    :   the number of paths that are selected
  + ### isPathSelected

    boolean isPathSelected([TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree") path)

    Returns true if the path, `path`, is in the current
    selection.

    current selection, the selection listeners are notified.
  + ### setRowMapper

    void setRowMapper([RowMapper](RowMapper.md "interface in javax.swing.tree") newMapper)

    Sets the RowMapper instance. This instance is used to determine
    the row for a particular TreePath.

    :   `newMapper` - RowMapper to be set
  + ### getRowMapper

    [RowMapper](RowMapper.md "interface in javax.swing.tree") getRowMapper()

    null (or an empty array) if there are no selected TreePaths or
    a RowMapper has not been set.

    :   all of the currently selected rows
  + ### getMinSelectionRow

    int getMinSelectionRow()

    Returns the smallest value obtained from the RowMapper for the
    current set of selected TreePaths. If nothing is selected,
    or there is no RowMapper, this will return -1.

        for the current set of selected TreePaths
  + ### getMaxSelectionRow

        for the current set of selected TreePaths
  + ### isRowSelected

    boolean isRowSelected(int row)

    Returns true if the row identified by `row` is selected.

    Parameters:
    :   `row` - row to check

    Returns:
    :   whether the row is selected
  + ### resetRowSelection

    void resetRowSelection()

    Updates this object's mapping from TreePaths to rows. This should
    be invoked when the mapping from TreePaths to integers has changed
    (for example, a node has been expanded).

    You do not normally have to call this; JTree and its associated
    listeners will invoke this for you. If you are implementing your own
    view class, then you will have to invoke this.
  + ### getLeadSelectionRow

    int getLeadSelectionRow()

    Returns the lead selection index. That is the last index that was
    added.

    :   the last path that was added
  + ### addPropertyChangeListener

    void addPropertyChangeListener([PropertyChangeListener](../../../java/beans/PropertyChangeListener.md "interface in java.beans") listener)
