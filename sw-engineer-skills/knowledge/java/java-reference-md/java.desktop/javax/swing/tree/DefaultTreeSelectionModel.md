# Class DefaultTreeSelectionModel

[java.lang.Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

javax.swing.tree.DefaultTreeSelectionModel

All Implemented Interfaces:
:   `Serializable`, `Cloneable`, `TreeSelectionModel`

Direct Known Subclasses:
:   `JTree.EmptySelectionModel`

---

public class DefaultTreeSelectionModel
extends [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Cloneable](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Cloneable.md "interface in java.lang"), [Serializable](../../../../java.base/java/io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io"), [TreeSelectionModel](TreeSelectionModel.md "interface in javax.swing.tree")

Default implementation of TreeSelectionModel. Listeners are notified
whenever
the paths in the selection change, not the rows. In order
to be able to track row changes you may wish to become a listener
for expansion events on the tree and test for changes from there.

resetRowSelection is called from any of the methods that update
the selected paths. If you subclass any of these methods to
filter what is allowed to be selected, be sure and message
`resetRowSelection` if you do not message super.
**Warning:**
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans
has been added to the `java.beans` package.
Please see [`XMLEncoder`](../../../java/beans/XMLEncoder.md "class in java.beans").

* ## Method Details

  + ### setRowMapper

    public void setRowMapper([RowMapper](RowMapper.md "interface in javax.swing.tree") newMapper)

    Sets the RowMapper instance. This instance is used to determine
    the row for a particular TreePath.

    Specified by:
    :   `setRowMapper` in interface `TreeSelectionModel`

    Parameters:
    :   `newMapper` - RowMapper to be set
  + ### getRowMapper

    public [RowMapper](RowMapper.md "interface in javax.swing.tree") getRowMapper()

    Returns the RowMapper instance that is able to map a TreePath to a
    row.

    Specified by:
    :   `getRowMapper` in interface `TreeSelectionModel`

    Returns:
    :   the RowMapper instance that is able to map a TreePath
        to a row
  + ### setSelectionMode

    public void setSelectionMode(int mode)

    Sets the selection model, which must be one of SINGLE\_TREE\_SELECTION,
    CONTIGUOUS\_TREE\_SELECTION or DISCONTIGUOUS\_TREE\_SELECTION. If mode
    is not one of the defined value,
    `DISCONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION` is assumed.

    This may change the selection if the current selection is not valid
    for the new mode. For example, if three TreePaths are
    selected when the mode is changed to `SINGLE_TREE_SELECTION`,
    only one TreePath will remain selected. It is up to the particular
    implementation to decide what TreePath remains selected.

    Setting the mode to something other than the defined types will
    result in the mode becoming `DISCONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION`.

    Specified by:
    :   `setSelectionMode` in interface `TreeSelectionModel`

    Parameters:
    :   `mode` - selection mode to be set
  + ### getSelectionMode

    public int getSelectionMode()

    Returns the selection mode, one of `SINGLE_TREE_SELECTION`,
    `DISCONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION` or
    `CONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION`.

    Specified by:
    :   `getSelectionMode` in interface `TreeSelectionModel`

    Returns:
    :   the current selection mode
  + ### setSelectionPath

    public void setSelectionPath([TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree") path)

    Sets the selection to path. If this represents a change, then
    the TreeSelectionListeners are notified. If `path` is
    null, this has the same effect as invoking `clearSelection`.

    Specified by:
    :   `setSelectionPath` in interface `TreeSelectionModel`

    Parameters:
    :   `path` - new path to select
  + ### setSelectionPaths

    public void setSelectionPaths([TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree")[] pPaths)

    Sets the selection. Whether the supplied paths are taken as the
    new selection depends upon the selection mode. If the supplied
    array is `null`, or empty, the selection is cleared. If
    the selection mode is `SINGLE_TREE_SELECTION`, only the
    first path in `pPaths` is used. If the selection
    mode is `CONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION` and the supplied paths
    are not contiguous, then only the first path in `pPaths` is
    used. If the selection mode is
    `DISCONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION`, then all paths are used.

    All `null` paths in `pPaths` are ignored.

    If this represents a change, all registered `TreeSelectionListener`s are notified.

    The lead path is set to the last unique path.

    The paths returned from `getSelectionPaths` are in the same
    order as those supplied to this method.

    Specified by:
    :   `setSelectionPaths` in interface `TreeSelectionModel`

    Parameters:
    :   `pPaths` - the new selection
  + ### addSelectionPath

    public void addSelectionPath([TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree") path)

    Adds path to the current selection. If path is not currently
    in the selection the TreeSelectionListeners are notified. This has
    no effect if `path` is null.

    Specified by:
    :   `addSelectionPath` in interface `TreeSelectionModel`

    Parameters:
    :   `path` - the new path to add to the current selection
  + ### addSelectionPaths

    public void addSelectionPaths([TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree")[] paths)

    Adds paths to the current selection. If any of the paths in
    paths are not currently in the selection the TreeSelectionListeners
    are notified. This has
    no effect if `paths` is null.

    The lead path is set to the last element in `paths`.

    If the selection mode is `CONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION`,
    and adding the new paths would make the selection discontiguous.
    Then two things can result: if the TreePaths in `paths`
    are contiguous, then the selection becomes these TreePaths,
    otherwise the TreePaths aren't contiguous and the selection becomes
    the first TreePath in `paths`.

    Specified by:
    :   `addSelectionPaths` in interface `TreeSelectionModel`

    Parameters:
    :   `paths` - the new path to add to the current selection
  + ### removeSelectionPath

    public void removeSelectionPath([TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree") path)

    Removes path from the selection. If path is in the selection
    The TreeSelectionListeners are notified. This has no effect if
    `path` is null.

    Specified by:
    :   `removeSelectionPath` in interface `TreeSelectionModel`

    Parameters:
    :   `path` - the path to remove from the selection
  + ### removeSelectionPaths

    public void removeSelectionPaths([TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree")[] paths)

    `FooListener.class`.
    For example, you can query a
    `DefaultTreeSelectionModel` `m`
    for its tree selection listeners with the following code:

        - [`getPropertyChangeListeners()`](#getPropertyChangeListeners())
  + ### getSelectionRows

    public int[] getSelectionRows()

    Returns the selection in terms of rows. There is not
    necessarily a one-to-one mapping between the `TreePath`s
    returned from `getSelectionPaths` and this method. In
    particular, if a `TreePath` is not viewable (the `RowMapper` returns `-1` for the row corresponding to the
    `TreePath`), then the corresponding row is not included
    in the returned array. For example, if the selection consists
    of two paths, `A` and `B`, with `A` at row
    `10`, and `B` not currently viewable, then this method
    returns an array with the single entry `10`.

    Returns:
    :   the smallest value obtained from the RowMapper
        for the current set of selected TreePaths
  + ### getMaxSelectionRow

    :   `getMaxSelectionRow` in interface `TreeSelectionModel`

    Returns:
    :   the largest value obtained from the RowMapper
        for the current set of selected TreePaths
  + ### isRowSelected

    Returns true if the row identified by `row` is selected.

    Specified by:
    :   `isRowSelected` in interface `TreeSelectionModel`

    Parameters:
    :   `row` - row to check

    Returns:
    :   whether the row is selected
  + ### resetRowSelection

    public void resetRowSelection()

    Updates this object's mapping from TreePath to rows. This should
    be invoked when the mapping from TreePaths to integers has changed
    (for example, a node has been expanded).

    You do not normally have to call this, JTree and its associated
    Listeners will invoke this for you. If you are implementing your own
    View class, then you will have to invoke this.

    This will invoke `insureRowContinuity` to make sure
    the currently selected TreePaths are still valid based on the
    selection mode.

    Specified by:
    :   `resetRowSelection` in interface `TreeSelectionModel`
  + ### getLeadSelectionRow

    public int getLeadSelectionRow()

    added.

    Specified by:
    :   `getLeadSelectionRow` in interface `TreeSelectionModel`

    Returns:
    :   the lead selection index
  + ### getLeadSelectionPath

    public [TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree") getLeadSelectionPath()

    Returns the last path that was added. This may differ from the
    leadSelectionPath property maintained by the JTree.

    Specified by:
    :   `getLeadSelectionPath` in interface `TreeSelectionModel`

    Returns:
    :   the last path that was added
  + ### addPropertyChangeListener

    public void addPropertyChangeListener([PropertyChangeListener](../../../java/beans/PropertyChangeListener.md "interface in java.beans") listener)

    Adds a PropertyChangeListener to the listener list.
    The listener is registered for all properties.

    Parameters:
    :   `listener` - the PropertyChangeListener to be added
  + ### removePropertyChangeListener

    public void removePropertyChangeListener([PropertyChangeListener](../../../java/beans/PropertyChangeListener.md "interface in java.beans") listener)

    Removes a PropertyChangeListener from the listener list.
    This removes a PropertyChangeListener that was registered

  + ### insureRowContinuity

    protected void insureRowContinuity()

    Makes sure the currently selected `TreePath`s are valid
    for the current selection mode.
    If the selection mode is `CONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION`
    and a `RowMapper` exists, this will make sure all
    the rows are contiguous, that is, when sorted all the rows are
    in order with no gaps.
    If the selection isn't contiguous, the selection is
    reset to contain the first set, when sorted, of contiguous rows.

    If the selection mode is `SINGLE_TREE_SELECTION` and
    more than one TreePath is selected, the selection is reset to
    contain the first path currently selected.
  + ### arePathsContiguous

    protected boolean arePathsContiguous([TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree")[] paths)

    Returns true if the paths are contiguous,
    or this object has no RowMapper.

    Parameters:
    :   `paths` - array of paths to check

    Returns:
    :   whether the paths are contiguous, or this object has no RowMapper
  + ### canPathsBeAdded

    protected boolean canPathsBeAdded([TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree")[] paths)

    Used to test if a particular set of `TreePath`s can
    be added. This will return true if `paths` is null (or
    empty), or this object has no RowMapper, or nothing is currently selected,
    or the selection mode is `DISCONTIGUOUS_TREE_SELECTION`, or
    adding the paths to the current selection still results in a
    contiguous set of `TreePath`s.

    Parameters:
    :   `paths` - array of `TreePaths` to check

    Returns:
    :   whether the particular set of `TreePaths` can be added
  + ### canPathsBeRemoved

    protected boolean canPathsBeRemoved([TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree")[] paths)

    Returns true if the paths can be removed without breaking the
    continuity of the model.
    This is rather expensive.

    Parameters:
    :   `paths` - array of `TreePath` to check

    Returns:
    :   whether the paths can be removed without breaking the
        continuity of the model
  + ### notifyPathChange

    [@Deprecated](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Deprecated.md "annotation interface in java.lang")
    protected void notifyPathChange([Vector](../../../../java.base/java/util/Vector.md "class in java.util")<?> changedPaths,
    [TreePath](TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree") oldLeadSelection)

    Deprecated.

    As of JDK version 1.7

    Notifies listeners of a change in path. changePaths should contain
    instances of PathPlaceHolder.

    Parameters:
    :   `changedPaths` - the vector of the changed paths
    :   `oldLeadSelection` - the old selection path
  + ### updateLeadIndex

    protected void updateLeadIndex()

    Updates the leadIndex instance variable.
  + ### insureUniqueness

    protected void insureUniqueness()

    This method is obsolete and its implementation is now a noop. It's
    still called by setSelectionPaths and addSelectionPaths, but only
    for backwards compatibility.
  + ### toString

    public [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Returns a string that displays and identifies this
    object's properties.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a String representation of this object
  + ### clone

    public [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") clone()
    throws [CloneNotSupportedException](../../../../java.base/java/lang/CloneNotSupportedException.md "class in java.lang")

    Returns a clone of this object with the same selection.
    This method does not duplicate
    selection listeners and property listeners.

    Overrides:
    :   `clone` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a clone of this instance.

    Throws:
    :   `CloneNotSupportedException` - never thrown by instances of
        this class
