public abstract class ComponentUI
extends [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

The base class for all UI delegate objects in the Swing pluggable
look and feel architecture. The UI delegate object for a Swing
component is responsible for implementing the aspects of the
component that depend on the look and feel.
The `JComponent` class
invokes methods from this class in order to delegate operations
(painting, layout calculations, etc.) that may vary depending on the
look and feel installed. **Client programs should not invoke methods
on this class directly.**

* ## Method Details

  + ### installUI

    public void installUI([JComponent](../JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c)

    Configures the specified component appropriately for the look and feel.
    This method is invoked when the `ComponentUI` instance is being installed
    as the UI delegate on the specified component. This method should
    completely configure the component for the look and feel,
    including the following:
    1. Install default property values for color, fonts, borders,
       icons, opacity, etc. on the component. Whenever possible,
       property values initialized by the client program should *not*
       be overridden.+ Install a `LayoutManager` on the component if necessary.+ Create/add any required sub-components to the component.+ Create/install event listeners on the component.+ Create/install a `PropertyChangeListener` on the component in order
               to detect and respond to component property changes appropriately.+ Install keyboard UI (mnemonics, traversal, etc.) on the component.+ Initialize any appropriate instance data.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - the component where this UI delegate is being installed

        - [`JComponent.setUI(javax.swing.plaf.ComponentUI)`](../JComponent.md#setUI(javax.swing.plaf.ComponentUI))
        - [`JComponent.updateUI()`](../JComponent.md#updateUI())
  + ### uninstallUI

    public void uninstallUI([JComponent](../JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c)

    Reverses configuration which was done on the specified component during
    `installUI`. This method is invoked when this
    `UIComponent` instance is being removed as the UI delegate
    for the specified component. This method should undo the
    configuration performed in `installUI`, being careful to
    leave the `JComponent` instance in a clean state (no
    extraneous listeners, look-and-feel-specific property objects, etc.).
    This should include the following:
    1. Remove any UI-set borders from the component.+ Remove any UI-set layout managers on the component.+ Remove any UI-added sub-components from the component.+ Remove any UI-added event/property listeners from the component.+ Remove any UI-installed keyboard UI from the component.+ Nullify any allocated instance data objects to allow for GC.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - the component from which this UI delegate is being removed;
        this argument is often ignored,
        but might be used if the UI object is stateless
        and shared by multiple components

  + ### paint

    public void paint([Graphics](../../../java/awt/Graphics.md "class in java.awt") g,
    [JComponent](../JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c)

    Paints the specified component appropriately for the look and feel.
    This method is invoked from the `ComponentUI.update` method when
    the specified component is being painted. Subclasses should override
    this method and use the specified `Graphics` object to
    render the content of the component.

    Parameters:
    :   `g` - the `Graphics` context in which to paint
    :   `c` - the component being painted;
        this argument is often ignored,
        but might be used if the UI object is stateless
        and shared by multiple components

    See Also:
    :   - [`update(java.awt.Graphics, javax.swing.JComponent)`](#update(java.awt.Graphics,javax.swing.JComponent))
  + ### update

    public void update([Graphics](../../../java/awt/Graphics.md "class in java.awt") g,
    [JComponent](../JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c)

    Notifies this UI delegate that it is time to paint the specified
    component. This method is invoked by `JComponent`
    when the specified component is being painted.

    By default this method fills the specified component with
    its background color if its `opaque` property is `true`,
    and then immediately calls `paint`. In general this method need
    not be overridden by subclasses; all look-and-feel rendering code should
    reside in the `paint` method.

    Parameters:
    :   `g` - the `Graphics` context in which to paint
    :   `c` - the component being painted;
        this argument is often ignored,
        but might be used if the UI object is stateless
        and shared by multiple components

  + ### getPreferredSize

    public [Dimension](../../../java/awt/Dimension.md "class in java.awt") getPreferredSize([JComponent](../JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c)

    Returns the specified component's preferred size appropriate for
    the look and feel. If `null` is returned, the preferred
    size will be calculated by the component's layout manager instead
    (this is the preferred approach for any component with a specific
    layout manager installed). The default implementation of this
    method returns `null`.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - the component whose preferred size is being queried;
        this argument is often ignored,
        but might be used if the UI object is stateless
        and shared by multiple components

    Returns:
    :   a `Dimension` object containing given component's preferred
        size appropriate for the look and feel

    See Also:
    :   - [`JComponent.getPreferredSize()`](../JComponent.md#getPreferredSize())
        - [`LayoutManager.preferredLayoutSize(java.awt.Container)`](../../../java/awt/LayoutManager.md#preferredLayoutSize(java.awt.Container))
  + ### getMinimumSize

    public [Dimension](../../../java/awt/Dimension.md "class in java.awt") getMinimumSize([JComponent](../JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c)

    Returns the specified component's minimum size appropriate for
    the look and feel. If `null` is returned, the minimum
    size will be calculated by the component's layout manager instead
    (this is the preferred approach for any component with a specific
    layout manager installed). The default implementation of this
    method invokes `getPreferredSize` and returns that value.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - the component whose minimum size is being queried;
        this argument is often ignored,
        but might be used if the UI object is stateless
        and shared by multiple components

    Returns:
    :   a `Dimension` object or `null`

    :   - [`JComponent.getMinimumSize()`](../JComponent.md#getMinimumSize())
        - [`LayoutManager.minimumLayoutSize(java.awt.Container)`](../../../java/awt/LayoutManager.md#minimumLayoutSize(java.awt.Container))
        - [`getPreferredSize(javax.swing.JComponent)`](#getPreferredSize(javax.swing.JComponent))
  + ### getMaximumSize

    public [Dimension](../../../java/awt/Dimension.md "class in java.awt") getMaximumSize([JComponent](../JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c)

    Returns the specified component's maximum size appropriate for
    the look and feel. If `null` is returned, the maximum
    size will be calculated by the component's layout manager instead
    (this is the preferred approach for any component with a specific
    layout manager installed). The default implementation of this
    method invokes `getPreferredSize` and returns that value.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - the component whose maximum size is being queried;
        this argument is often ignored,
        but might be used if the UI object is stateless
        and shared by multiple components

    Returns:
    :   a `Dimension` object or `null`

    :   - [`JComponent.getMaximumSize()`](../JComponent.md#getMaximumSize())
        - [`LayoutManager2.maximumLayoutSize(java.awt.Container)`](../../../java/awt/LayoutManager2.md#maximumLayoutSize(java.awt.Container))
  + ### contains

    public boolean contains([JComponent](../JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c,
    int x,
    int y)

    Returns `true` if the specified *x,y* location is
    contained within the look and feel's defined shape of the specified
    component. `x` and `y` are defined to be relative
    to the coordinate system of the specified component. Although
    a component's `bounds` is constrained to a rectangle,
    this method provides the means for defining a non-rectangular
    shape within those bounds for the purpose of hit detection.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - the component where the *x,y* location is being queried;
        this argument is often ignored,
        but might be used if the UI object is stateless
        and shared by multiple components
    :   `x` - the *x* coordinate of the point
    :   `y` - the *y* coordinate of the point

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the specified `x,y` location is contained
        within the look and feel's defined shape for the given component

    See Also:
    :   - [`JComponent.contains(int, int)`](../JComponent.md#contains(int,int))
        - [`Component.contains(int, int)`](../../../java/awt/Component.md#contains(int,int))
  + ### createUI

    public static [ComponentUI](ComponentUI.md "class in javax.swing.plaf") createUI([JComponent](../JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c)

    Returns an instance of the UI delegate for the specified component.
    Each subclass must provide its own static `createUI`
    method that returns an instance of that UI delegate subclass.
    If the UI delegate subclass is stateless, it may return an instance
    that is shared by multiple components. If the UI delegate is
    stateful, then it should return a new instance per component.
    The default implementation of this method throws an error, as it
    should never be invoked.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - a `JComponent` for which to create a UI delegate

    Returns:
    :   a `ComponentUI` object for `c`
  + ### getBaseline

    public int getBaseline([JComponent](../JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c,
    int width,
    int height)

    Returns the baseline. The baseline is measured from the top of
    the component. This method is primarily meant for
    `LayoutManager`s to align components along their
    baseline. A return value less than 0 indicates this component
    does not have a reasonable baseline and that
    `LayoutManager`s should not align this component on
    its baseline.

    This method returns -1. Subclasses that have a meaningful baseline
    should override appropriately.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - `JComponent` baseline is being requested for
    :   `width` - the width to get the baseline for
    :   `height` - the height to get the baseline for

    Returns:
    :   baseline or a value < 0 indicating there is no reasonable
        baseline

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `c` is `null`
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if width or height is < 0

    Since:
    :   1.6

    See Also:
    :   - [`JComponent.getBaseline(int,int)`](../JComponent.md#getBaseline(int,int))
  + ### getBaselineResizeBehavior

    public [Component.BaselineResizeBehavior](../../../java/awt/Component.BaselineResizeBehavior.md "enum class in java.awt") getBaselineResizeBehavior([JComponent](../JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c)

    Returns an enum indicating how the baseline of the component
    changes as the size changes. This method is primarily meant for
    layout managers and GUI builders.

    This method returns `BaselineResizeBehavior.OTHER`.
    Subclasses that support a baseline should override appropriately.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - `JComponent` to return baseline resize behavior for

    Returns:
    :   an enum indicating how the baseline changes as the component
        size changes

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `c` is `null`

    Since:
    :   1.6

    See Also:
    :   - [`JComponent.getBaseline(int, int)`](../JComponent.md#getBaseline(int,int))
  + ### getAccessibleChildrenCount

    public int getAccessibleChildrenCount([JComponent](../JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c)

    Returns the number of accessible children in the object. If all
    of the children of this object implement `Accessible`,
    this
    method should return the number of children of this object.
    UIs might wish to override this if they present areas on the
    screen that can be viewed as components, but actual components
    are not used for presenting those areas.
    Note: As of v1.3, it is recommended that developers call
    `Component.AccessibleAWTComponent.getAccessibleChildrenCount()` instead
    of this method.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - `JComponent` for which to get count of accessible children

    Returns:
    :   the number of accessible children in the object

    See Also:
    :   - [`getAccessibleChild(javax.swing.JComponent, int)`](#getAccessibleChild(javax.swing.JComponent,int))
  + ### getAccessibleChild

    public [Accessible](../../accessibility/Accessible.md "interface in javax.accessibility") getAccessibleChild([JComponent](../JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c,
    int i)

    Returns the `i`th `Accessible` child of the object.
    UIs might need to override this if they present areas on the
    screen that can be viewed as components, but actual components
    are not used for presenting those areas.

    Note: As of v1.3, it is recommended that developers call
    `Component.AccessibleAWTComponent.getAccessibleChild()` instead of
    this method.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - a `JComponent` for which to get a child object
    :   `i` - zero-based index of child

    Returns:
    :   the `i`th `Accessible` child of the object
