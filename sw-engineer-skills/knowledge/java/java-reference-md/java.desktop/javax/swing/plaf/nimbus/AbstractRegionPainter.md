  + ### paint

    public final void paint([Graphics2D](../../../../java/awt/Graphics2D.md "class in java.awt") g,
    [JComponent](../../JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c,
    int w,
    int h)

    Renders to the given [`Graphics2D`](../../../../java/awt/Graphics2D.md "class in java.awt") object. Implementations
    of this method *may* modify state on the `Graphics2D`, and are not
    required to restore that state upon completion. In most cases, it is recommended
    that the caller pass in a scratch graphics object. The `Graphics2D`
    must never be null.

    State on the graphics object may be honored by the `paint` method,
    but may not be. For instance, setting the antialiasing rendering hint on the
    graphics may or may not be respected by the `Painter` implementation.

    The supplied object parameter acts as an optional configuration argument.
    For example, it could be of type `Component`. A `Painter`
    that expected it could then read state from that `Component` and
    use the state for painting. For example, an implementation may read the
    backgroundColor and use that.

    Generally, to enhance reusability, most standard `Painter`s ignore
    this parameter. They can thus be reused in any context. The `object`
    may be null. Implementations must not throw a NullPointerException if the object
    parameter is null.

    Finally, the `width` and `height` arguments specify the
    width and height that the `Painter` should paint into. More
    specifically, the specified width and height instruct the painter that it should
    paint fully within this width and height. Any specified clip on the
    `g` param will further constrain the region.

    For example, suppose I have a `Painter` implementation that draws
    a gradient. The gradient goes from white to black. It "stretches" to fill the
    painted region. Thus, if I use this `Painter` to paint a 500 x 500
    region, the far left would be black, the far right would be white, and a smooth
    gradient would be painted between. I could then, without modification, reuse the
    `Painter` to paint a region that is 20x20 in size. This region would
    also be black on the left, white on the right, and a smooth gradient painted
    between.

    Specified by:
    :   `paint` in interface `Painter<JComponent>`

    Parameters:
    :   `g` - The Graphics2D to render to. This must not be null.
    :   `c` - an optional configuration parameter. This may be null.
    :   `w` - width of the area to paint.
    :   `h` - height of the area to paint.
  + ### getExtendedCacheKeys

    protected [Object](../../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")[] getExtendedCacheKeys([JComponent](../../JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c)

    Get any extra attributes which the painter implementation would like
    to include in the image cache lookups. This is checked for every call
    of the paint(g, c, w, h) method.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - The component on the current paint call

    Returns:
    :   Array of extra objects to be included in the cache key
  + ### getPaintContext

    protected abstract [AbstractRegionPainter.PaintContext](AbstractRegionPainter.PaintContext.md "class in javax.swing.plaf.nimbus") getPaintContext()

    Gets the PaintContext for this painting operation. This method is called on every
    paint, and so should be fast and produce no garbage. The PaintContext contains
    information such as cache hints. It also contains data necessary for decoding
    points at runtime, such as the stretching insets, the canvas size at which the
    encoded points were defined, and whether the stretching insets are inverted.

    This method allows for subclasses to package the painting of different states
    with possibly different canvas sizes, etc, into one AbstractRegionPainter implementation.

    Returns:
    :   a PaintContext associated with this paint operation.
  + ### configureGraphics

    protected void configureGraphics([Graphics2D](../../../../java/awt/Graphics2D.md "class in java.awt") g)

    Configures the given Graphics2D. Often, rendering hints or compositing rules are
    applied to a Graphics2D object prior to painting, which should affect all of the
    subsequent painting operations. This method provides a convenient hook for configuring
    the Graphics object prior to rendering, regardless of whether the render operation is
    performed to an intermediate buffer or directly to the display.

    Parameters:
    :   `g` - The Graphics2D object to configure. Will not be null.
  + ### doPaint

    protected abstract void doPaint([Graphics2D](../../../../java/awt/Graphics2D.md "class in java.awt") g,
    [JComponent](../../JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c,
    int width,
    int height,
    [Object](../../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")[] extendedCacheKeys)

    Actually performs the painting operation. Subclasses must implement this method.
    The graphics object passed may represent the actual surface being rendered to,
    or it may be an intermediate buffer. It has also been pre-translated. Simply render
    the component as if it were located at 0, 0 and had a width of `width`
    and a height of `height`. For performance reasons, you may want to read
    the clip from the Graphics2D object and only render within that space.

    Parameters:
    :   `g` - The Graphics2D surface to paint to
    :   `c` - The JComponent related to the drawing event. For example, if the
        region being rendered is Button, then `c` will be a
        JButton. If the region being drawn is ScrollBarSlider, then the
        component will be JScrollBar. This value may be null.
    :   `width` - The width of the region to paint. Note that in the case of
        painting the foreground, this value may differ from c.getWidth().
    :   `height` - The height of the region to paint. Note that in the case of
        painting the foreground, this value may differ from c.getHeight().
    :   `extendedCacheKeys` - The result of the call to getExtendedCacheKeys()

    protected final float decodeX(float x)

    Decodes and returns a float value representing the actual pixel location for
    the given encoded X value.

    Parameters:
    :   `x` - an encoded x value (0...1, or 1...2, or 2...3)

    Returns:

    protected final float decodeAnchorX(float x,
    float dx)

    Decodes and returns a float value representing the actual pixel location for
    the anchor point given the encoded X value of the control point, and the offset
    distance to the anchor from that control point.

    Parameters:
    :   `x` - an encoded x value of the bezier control point (0...1, or 1...2, or 2...3)
    :   `dx` - the offset distance to the anchor from the control point x

    Returns:
    :   the decoded x location of the control point

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `x < 0` or `x > 3`
  + ### decodeAnchorY

    protected final float decodeAnchorY(float y,
    float dy)

    Decodes and returns a float value representing the actual pixel location for
    the anchor point given the encoded Y value of the control point, and the offset
    distance to the anchor from that control point.

    Parameters:

  + ### decodeGradient

    protected final [LinearGradientPaint](../../../../java/awt/LinearGradientPaint.md "class in java.awt") decodeGradient(float x1,
    float y1,
    float x2,
    float y2,
    float[] midpoints,
    [Color](../../../../java/awt/Color.md "class in java.awt")[] colors)

    Given parameters for creating a LinearGradientPaint, this method will
    create and return a linear gradient paint. One primary purpose for this
    method is to avoid creating a LinearGradientPaint where the start and
    end points are equal. In such a case, the end y point is slightly
    increased to avoid the overlap.

    Parameters:
    :   `x1` - x1
    :   `y1` - y1
    :   `x2` - x2
    :   `y2` - y2
    :   `midpoints` - the midpoints
    :   `colors` - the colors

    Returns:
    :   a valid LinearGradientPaint. This method never returns null.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `midpoints` array is null,
        or `colors` array is null,
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if start and end points are the same points,
        or `midpoints.length != colors.length`,
        or `colors` is less than 2 in size,
        or a `midpoints` value is less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0,
        or the `midpoints` are not provided in strictly increasing order
  + ### decodeRadialGradient

    protected final [RadialGradientPaint](../../../../java/awt/RadialGradientPaint.md "class in java.awt") decodeRadialGradient(float x,
    float y,
    float r,
    float[] midpoints,
    [Color](../../../../java/awt/Color.md "class in java.awt")[] colors)

    Given parameters for creating a RadialGradientPaint, this method will
    create and return a radial gradient paint. One primary purpose for this
    method is to avoid creating a RadialGradientPaint where the radius
    is non-positive. In such a case, the radius is just slightly
    increased to avoid 0.

    Parameters:
    :   `x` - x-coordinate
    :   `y` - y-coordinate
    :   `r` - radius
    :   `midpoints` - the midpoints
    :   `colors` - the colors

    Returns:
    :   a valid RadialGradientPaint. This method never returns null.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `midpoints` array is null,
        or `colors` array is null
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `r` is non-positive,
        or `midpoints.length != colors.length`,
        or `colors` is less than 2 in size,
        or a `midpoints` value is less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0,
        or the `midpoints` are not provided in strictly increasing order
  + ### getComponentColor

    protected final [Color](../../../../java/awt/Color.md "class in java.awt") getComponentColor([JComponent](../../JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c,
    [String](../../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") property,
    [Color](../../../../java/awt/Color.md "class in java.awt") defaultColor,
    float saturationOffset,
    float brightnessOffset,
    int alphaOffset)

    Get a color property from the given JComponent. First checks for a
    `getXXX()` method and if that fails checks for a client
    property with key `property`. If that still fails to return
    a Color then `defaultColor` is returned.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - The component to get the color property from
    :   `property` - The name of a bean style property or client property
    :   `defaultColor` - The color to return if no color was obtained from
        the component.
    :   `saturationOffset` - additively modifies the HSB saturation component
        of the color returned (ignored if default color is returned).
    :   `brightnessOffset` - additively modifies the HSB brightness component
        of the color returned (ignored if default color is returned).
    :   `alphaOffset` - additively modifies the ARGB alpha component of the
        color returned (ignored if default color is returned).

    Returns:
    :   The color that was obtained from the component or defaultColor
