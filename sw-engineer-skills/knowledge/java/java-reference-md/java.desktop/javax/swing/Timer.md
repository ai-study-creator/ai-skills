# Class Timer

[java.lang.Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

javax.swing.Timer

All Implemented Interfaces:
:   `Serializable`

---

public class Timer
extends [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Serializable](../../../java.base/java/io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io")

Fires one or more `ActionEvent`s at specified
intervals. An example use is an animation object that uses a
`Timer` as the trigger for drawing its frames.

Setting up a timer
involves creating a `Timer` object,
registering one or more action listeners on it,
and starting the timer using
the `start` method.
For example,
the following code creates and starts a timer
that fires an action event once per second
(as specified by the first argument to the `Timer` constructor).
The second argument to the `Timer` constructor
specifies a listener to receive the timer's action events.

```
  int delay = 1000; //milliseconds
  ActionListener taskPerformer = new ActionListener() {
      public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
          //...Perform a task...
      }
  };
  new Timer(delay, taskPerformer).start();
```

`Timers` are constructed by specifying both a delay parameter
and an `ActionListener`. The delay parameter is used
to set both the initial delay and the delay between event
firing, in milliseconds. Once the timer has been started,
it waits for the initial delay before firing its
first `ActionEvent` to registered listeners.
After this first event, it continues to fire events
every time the between-event delay has elapsed, until it
is stopped.

After construction, the initial delay and the between-event
delay can be changed independently, and additional
`ActionListeners` may be added.

If you want the timer to fire only the first time and then stop,
invoke `setRepeats(false)` on the timer.

Although all `Timer`s perform their waiting
using a single, shared thread
(created by the first `Timer` object that executes),
the action event handlers for `Timer`s
execute on another thread -- the event-dispatching thread.
This means that the action handlers for `Timer`s
can safely perform operations on Swing components.
However, it also means that the handlers must execute quickly
to keep the GUI responsive.

In v 1.3, another `Timer` class was added
to the Java platform: `java.util.Timer`.
Both it and `javax.swing.Timer`
provide the same basic functionality,
but `java.util.Timer`
is more general and has more features.
The `javax.swing.Timer` has two features
that can make it a little easier to use with GUIs.
First, its event handling metaphor is familiar to GUI programmers
and can make dealing with the event-dispatching thread
a bit simpler.
Second, its
automatic thread sharing means that you don't have to
take special steps to avoid spawning
too many threads.
Instead, your timer uses the same thread
used to make cursors blink,
tool tips appear,
and so on.

You can find further documentation
and several examples of using timers by visiting
[How to Use Timers](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/misc/timer.html),
a section in *The Java Tutorial.*

**Warning:**
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans
has been added to the `java.beans` package.

  + ### Timer

    public Timer(int delay,
    [ActionListener](../../java/awt/event/ActionListener.md "interface in java.awt.event") listener)

    Creates a `Timer` and initializes both the initial delay and
    between-event delay to `delay` milliseconds. If `delay`
    is less than or equal to zero, the timer fires as soon as it
    is started. If `listener` is not `null`,
    it's registered as an action listener on the timer.

    Parameters:
    :   `delay` - milliseconds for the initial and between-event delay
    :   `listener` - an initial listener; can be `null`

    Returns an array of all the objects currently registered as
    `FooListener`s
    upon this `Timer`.
    `FooListener`s
    are registered using the `addFooListener` method.

    You can specify the `listenerType` argument
    with a class literal, such as `FooListener.class`.
    For example, you can query a `Timer`
    instance `t`
    for its action listeners
    with the following code:

    ```
    ActionListener[] als = (ActionListener[])(t.getListeners(ActionListener.class));
    ```

    If no such listeners exist,
    this method returns an empty array.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of `EventListener` class being requested

    Parameters:
    :   `listenerType` - the type of listeners requested;
        this parameter should specify an interface
        that descends from `java.util.EventListener`

    Returns:
    :   an array of all objects registered as
        `FooListener`s
        on this timer,
        or an empty array if no such
        listeners have been added

    Throws:
    :   `ClassCastException` - if `listenerType` doesn't
        specify a class or interface that implements
        `java.util.EventListener`

    Enables or disables the timer log. When enabled, a message
    is posted to `System.out` whenever the timer goes off.

    Parameters:
    :   `flag` - `true` to enable logging

    See Also:
    :   - [`getLogTimers()`](#getLogTimers())
  + ### getLogTimers

    public static boolean getLogTimers()

    :   - [`setLogTimers(boolean)`](#setLogTimers(boolean))
  + ### setDelay

    public void setDelay(int delay)

    Sets the `Timer`'s between-event delay, the number of milliseconds
    between successive action events. This does not affect the initial delay
    property, which can be set by the `setInitialDelay` method.

    Parameters:
    :   `delay` - the delay in milliseconds

    See Also:
    :   - [`setInitialDelay(int)`](#setInitialDelay(int))
  + ### getDelay

    public int getDelay()

    Returns the delay, in milliseconds,
    between firings of action events.

    Returns:
    :   the delay, in milliseconds, between firings of action events

    See Also:
    :   - [`setDelay(int)`](#setDelay(int))
        - [`getInitialDelay()`](#getInitialDelay())
  + ### setInitialDelay

    public void setInitialDelay(int initialDelay)

    Sets the `Timer`'s initial delay, the time
    in milliseconds to wait after the timer is started
    before firing the first event. Upon construction, this
    is set to be the same as the between-event delay,
    but then its value is independent and remains unaffected
    by changes to the between-event delay.

    Parameters:
    :   `initialDelay` - the initial delay, in milliseconds

    See Also:
    :   - [`setDelay(int)`](#setDelay(int))
  + ### getInitialDelay

    public int getInitialDelay()

    Returns the `Timer`'s initial delay.

    Returns:
    :   the `Timer`'s initial delay, in milliseconds

    See Also:
    :   - [`setInitialDelay(int)`](#setInitialDelay(int))
        - [`setDelay(int)`](#setDelay(int))
  + ### setRepeats

    public void setRepeats(boolean flag)

    If `flag` is `false`,
    instructs the `Timer` to send only one
    action event to its listeners.

    Parameters:
    :   `flag` - specify `false` to make the timer
        stop after sending its first action event
  + ### isRepeats

    public boolean isRepeats()

    Returns `true` (the default)
    if the `Timer` will send
    an action event
    to its listeners multiple times.

    Returns:
    :   true if the `Timer` will send an action event to its
        listeners multiple times

    See Also:
    :   - [`setRepeats(boolean)`](#setRepeats(boolean))
  + ### setCoalesce

    public void setCoalesce(boolean flag)

    Sets whether the `Timer` coalesces multiple pending
    `ActionEvent` firings.
    A busy application may not be able
    to keep up with a `Timer`'s event generation,
    causing multiple
    action events to be queued. When processed,
    the application sends these events one after the other, causing the
    `Timer`'s listeners to receive a sequence of
    events with no delay between them. Coalescing avoids this situation
    by reducing multiple pending events to a single event.
    `Timer`s
    coalesce events by default.

    Parameters:
    :   `flag` - specify `false` to turn off coalescing
  + ### isCoalesce

    public boolean isCoalesce()

    Returns `true` if the `Timer` coalesces
    multiple pending action events.

    Returns:
    :   true if the `Timer` coalesces multiple pending
        action events

    See Also:
    :   - [`setCoalesce(boolean)`](#setCoalesce(boolean))
  + ### setActionCommand

    public void setActionCommand([String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") command)

    Sets the string that will be delivered as the action command
    in `ActionEvent`s fired by this timer.
    `null` is an acceptable value.

    Parameters:
    :   `command` - the action command

    Since:
    :   1.6
  + ### getActionCommand

    public [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getActionCommand()

    Returns the string that will be delivered as the action command
    in `ActionEvent`s fired by this timer. May be
    `null`, which is also the default.

    Returns:
    :   the action command used in firing events

    Since:
    :   1.6
  + ### start

    public void start()

    Starts the `Timer`,
    causing it to start sending action events
    to its listeners.

    See Also:
    :   - [`stop()`](#stop())

    public boolean isRunning()

    Returns `true` if the `Timer` is running.

    Returns:
    :   true if the `Timer` is running, false otherwise

    See Also:
