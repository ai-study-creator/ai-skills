* ## Method Details

  + ### treeNodesChanged

    void treeNodesChanged([TreeModelEvent](TreeModelEvent.md "class in javax.swing.event") e)

    Invoked after a node (or a set of siblings) has changed in some
    way. The node(s) have not changed locations in the tree or
    altered their children arrays, but other attributes have
    changed and may affect presentation. Example: the name of a
    file has changed, but it is in the same location in the file
    system.

    To indicate the root has changed, childIndices and children
    will be null.

    Use `e.getPath()` to get the parent of the changed node(s).
    `e.getChildIndices()` returns the index(es) of the changed node(s).

    Parameters:
    :   `e` - a `TreeModelEvent` describing changes to a tree model
  + ### treeNodesInserted

    void treeNodesInserted([TreeModelEvent](TreeModelEvent.md "class in javax.swing.event") e)

    Invoked after nodes have been inserted into the tree.

    Use `e.getPath()` to get the parent of the new node(s).
    `e.getChildIndices()` returns the index(es) of the new node(s)
    in ascending order.

    Parameters:
    :   `e` - a `TreeModelEvent` describing changes to a tree model
  + ### treeNodesRemoved

    void treeNodesRemoved([TreeModelEvent](TreeModelEvent.md "class in javax.swing.event") e)

    Invoked after nodes have been removed from the tree. Note that
    if a subtree is removed from the tree, this method may only be
    invoked once for the root of the removed subtree, not once for
    each individual set of siblings removed.

    Use `e.getPath()` to get the former parent of the deleted
    node(s). `e.getChildIndices()` returns, in ascending order, the
    index(es) the node(s) had before being deleted.

    Parameters:
    :   `e` - a `TreeModelEvent` describing changes to a tree model
  + ### treeStructureChanged

    void treeStructureChanged([TreeModelEvent](TreeModelEvent.md "class in javax.swing.event") e)

    Invoked after the tree has drastically changed structure from a
    given node down. If the path returned by e.getPath() is of length
    one and the first element does not identify the current root node
    the first element should become the new root of the tree.

    Use `e.getPath()` to get the path to the node.
    `e.getChildIndices()` returns null.

    Parameters:
    :   `e` - a `TreeModelEvent` describing changes to a tree model
