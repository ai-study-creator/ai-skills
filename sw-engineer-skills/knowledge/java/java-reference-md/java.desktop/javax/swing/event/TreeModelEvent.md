    public TreeModelEvent([Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") source,
    [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")[] path,
    int[] childIndices,
    [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")[] children)

    Used to create an event when nodes have been changed, inserted, or
    removed, identifying the path to the parent of the modified items as
    an array of Objects. All of the modified objects are siblings which are
    direct descendents (not grandchildren) of the specified parent.
    The positions at which the inserts, deletes, or changes occurred are
    specified by an array of `int`. The indexes in that array
    must be in order, from lowest to highest.

    For changes, the indexes in the model correspond exactly to the indexes
    of items currently displayed in the UI. As a result, it is not really
    critical if the indexes are not in their exact order. But after multiple
    inserts or deletes, the items currently in the UI no longer correspond
    to the items in the model. It is therefore critical to specify the
    indexes properly for inserts and deletes.

    For inserts, the indexes represent the *final* state of the tree,
    after the inserts have occurred. Since the indexes must be specified in
    order, the most natural processing methodology is to do the inserts
    starting at the lowest index and working towards the highest. Accumulate
    a Vector of `Integer` objects that specify the
    insert-locations as you go, then convert the Vector to an
    array of `int` to create the event. When the postition-index
    equals zero, the node is inserted at the beginning of the list. When the
    position index equals the size of the list, the node is "inserted" at
    (appended to) the end of the list.

    For deletes, the indexes represent the *initial* state of the tree,
    before the deletes have occurred. Since the indexes must be specified in
    order, the most natural processing methodology is to use a delete-counter.
    Start by initializing the counter to zero and start work through the
    list from lowest to highest. Every time you do a delete, add the current
    value of the delete-counter to the index-position where the delete occurred,
    and append the result to a Vector of delete-locations, using
    `addElement()`. Then increment the delete-counter. The index
    positions stored in the Vector therefore reflect the effects of all previous
    deletes, so they represent each object's position in the initial tree.
    (You could also start at the highest index and working back towards the
    lowest, accumulating a Vector of delete-locations as you go using the
    `insertElementAt(Integer, 0)`.) However you produce the Vector
    of initial-positions, you then need to convert the Vector of `Integer`
    objects to an array of `int` to create the event.

    **Notes:**
    - Like the `insertNodeInto` method in the
      `DefaultTreeModel` class, `insertElementAt`
      appends to the `Vector` when the index matches the size
      of the vector. So you can use `insertElementAt(Integer, 0)`
      even when the vector is empty.
    - To create a node changed event for the root node, specify the parent
      and the child indices as `null`.

    Parameters:
    :   `source` - the Object responsible for generating the event (typically
        the creator of the event object passes `this`
        for its value)
    :   `path` - an array of Object identifying the path to the
        parent of the modified item(s), where the first element
        of the array is the Object stored at the root node and
        the last element is the Object stored at the parent node
    :   `childIndices` - an array of `int` that specifies the
        index values of the removed items. The indices must be
        in sorted order, from lowest to highest
    :   `children` - an array of Object containing the inserted, removed, or
        changed objects

    int[] childIndices,
    [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")[] children)

    Used to create an event when nodes have been changed, inserted, or
    removed, identifying the path to the parent of the modified items as
    a TreePath object. For more information on how to specify the indexes
    and objects, see
    `TreeModelEvent(Object,Object[],int[],Object[])`.

    Parameters:
    :   `source` - the Object responsible for generating the event (typically
        the creator of the event object passes `this`
        for its value)
    :   `path` - a TreePath object that identifies the path to the
        parent of the modified item(s)
    :   `childIndices` - an array of `int` that specifies the
        index values of the modified items
    :   `children` - an array of Object containing the inserted, removed, or
        changed objects

    [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")[] path)

    Used to create an event when the node structure has changed in some way,
    identifying the path to the root of a modified subtree as an array of
    Objects. A structure change event might involve nodes swapping position,
    for example, or it might encapsulate multiple inserts and deletes in the
    subtree stemming from the node, where the changes may have taken place at
    different levels of the subtree.
    > **Note:**  
    > JTree collapses all nodes under the specified node, so that only its
    > immediate children are visible.

    Parameters:
    :   `source` - the Object responsible for generating the event (typically
        the creator of the event object passes `this`
        for its value)
    :   `path` - an array of Object identifying the path to the root of the
        modified subtree, where the first element of the array is
        the object stored at the root node and the last element
        is the object stored at the changed node

    public TreeModelEvent([Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") source,
    [TreePath](../tree/TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree") path)

    Used to create an event when the node structure has changed in some way,
    identifying the path to the root of the modified subtree as a TreePath
    object. For more information on this event specification, see
    `TreeModelEvent(Object,Object[])`.

    Parameters:
    :   `source` - the Object responsible for generating the event (typically
        the creator of the event object passes `this`
        for its value)
    :   `path` - a TreePath object that identifies the path to the
        change. In the DefaultTreeModel,
        this object contains an array of user-data objects,
        but a subclass of TreePath could use some totally
        different mechanism -- for example, a node ID number

* ## Method Details

  + ### getTreePath

    public [TreePath](../tree/TreePath.md "class in javax.swing.tree") getTreePath()

    For all events, except treeStructureChanged,
    returns the parent of the changed nodes.
    For treeStructureChanged events, returns the ancestor of the
    structure that has changed. This and
    `getChildIndices` are used to get a list of the effected
    nodes.

    The one exception to this is a treeNodesChanged event that is to
    identify the root, in which case this will return the root
    and `getChildIndices` will return null.

    Returns:
    :   the TreePath used in identifying the changed nodes.

    See Also:
    :   - [`TreePath.getLastPathComponent()`](../tree/TreePath.md#getLastPathComponent())
  + ### getPath

    public [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")[] getPath()

    Convenience method to get the array of objects from the TreePath
    instance that this event wraps.

    Returns:
    :   an array of Objects, where the first Object is the one
        stored at the root and the last object is the one
        stored at the node identified by the path
  + ### getChildren

    public [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")[] getChildren()

    Returns the objects that are children of the node identified by
    `getPath` at the locations specified by
    `getChildIndices`. If this is a removal event the
    returned objects are no longer children of the parent node.

    Returns:
    :   an array of Object containing the children specified by
        the event

    See Also:
    :   - [`getPath()`](#getPath())
        - [`getChildIndices()`](#getChildIndices())
  + ### getChildIndices

    public int[] getChildIndices()

    Returns the values of the child indexes. If this is a removal event
    the indexes point to locations in the initial list where items
    were removed. If it is an insert, the indices point to locations
    in the final list where the items were added. For node changes,
    the indices point to the locations of the modified nodes.

    Returns:
    :   an array of `int` containing index locations for
        the children specified by the event
  + ### toString

    public [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Returns a string that displays and identifies this object's
    properties.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `EventObject`

    Returns:
    :   a String representation of this object
