The `JTable` is used to display and edit regular two-dimensional tables
of cells.
See [How to Use Tables](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/table.html)
in *The Java Tutorial*
for task-oriented documentation and examples of using `JTable`.

The `JTable` has many
facilities that make it possible to customize its rendering and editing
but provides defaults for these features so that simple tables can be
set up easily. For example, to set up a table with 10 rows and 10
columns of numbers:

```
      TableModel dataModel = new AbstractTableModel() {
          public int getColumnCount() { return 10; }
          public int getRowCount() { return 10;}
          public Object getValueAt(int row, int col) { return Integer.valueOf(row*col); }
      };
      JTable table = new JTable(dataModel);
      JScrollPane scrollpane = new JScrollPane(table);
```

`JTable`s are typically placed inside of a `JScrollPane`. By
default, a `JTable` will adjust its width such that
a horizontal scrollbar is unnecessary. To allow for a horizontal scrollbar,
invoke [`setAutoResizeMode(int)`](#setAutoResizeMode(int)) with `AUTO_RESIZE_OFF`.
Note that if you wish to use a `JTable` in a standalone
view (outside of a `JScrollPane`) and want the header
displayed, you can get it using [`getTableHeader()`](#getTableHeader()) and
display it separately.

To enable sorting and filtering of rows, use a
`RowSorter`.
You can set up a row sorter in either of two ways:

* Directly set the `RowSorter`. For example:
  `table.setRowSorter(new TableRowSorter(model))`.* Set the `autoCreateRowSorter`
    property to `true`, so that the `JTable`
    creates a `RowSorter` for
    you. For example: `setAutoCreateRowSorter(true)`.

When designing applications that use the `JTable` it is worth paying
close attention to the data structures that will represent the table's data.
The `DefaultTableModel` is a model implementation that
uses a `Vector` of `Vector`s of `Object`s to
store the cell values. As well as copying the data from an
application into the `DefaultTableModel`,
it is also possible to wrap the data in the methods of the
`TableModel` interface so that the data can be passed to the
`JTable` directly, as in the example above. This often results
in more efficient applications because the model is free to choose the
internal representation that best suits the data.
A good rule of thumb for deciding whether to use the `AbstractTableModel`
or the `DefaultTableModel` is to use the `AbstractTableModel`
as the base class for creating subclasses and the `DefaultTableModel`
when subclassing is not required.

The "TableExample" directory in the demo area of the source distribution
gives a number of complete examples of `JTable` usage,
covering how the `JTable` can be used to provide an
editable view of data taken from a database and how to modify
the columns in the display to use specialized renderers and editors.

The `JTable` uses integers exclusively to refer to both the rows and the columns
of the model that it displays. The `JTable` simply takes a tabular range of cells
and uses `getValueAt(int, int)` to retrieve the
values from the model during painting. It is important to remember that
the column and row indexes returned by various `JTable` methods
are in terms of the `JTable` (the view) and are not
necessarily the same indexes used by the model.

By default, columns may be rearranged in the `JTable` so that the
view's columns appear in a different order to the columns in the model.
This does not affect the implementation of the model at all: when the
columns are reordered, the `JTable` maintains the new order of the columns
internally and converts its column indices before querying the model.

So, when writing a `TableModel`, it is not necessary to listen for column
reordering events as the model will be queried in its own coordinate
system regardless of what is happening in the view.
In the examples area there is a demonstration of a sorting algorithm making
use of exactly this technique to interpose yet another coordinate system
where the order of the rows is changed, rather than the order of the columns.

Similarly when using the sorting and filtering functionality
provided by `RowSorter` the underlying
`TableModel` does not need to know how to do sorting,
rather `RowSorter` will handle it. Coordinate
conversions will be necessary when using the row based methods of
`JTable` with the underlying `TableModel`.
All of `JTable`s row based methods are in terms of the
`RowSorter`, which is not necessarily the same as that
of the underlying `TableModel`. For example, the
selection is always in terms of `JTable` so that when
using `RowSorter` you will need to convert using
`convertRowIndexToView` or
`convertRowIndexToModel`. The following shows how to
convert coordinates from `JTable` to that of the
underlying model:

```
   int[] selection = table.getSelectedRows();
   for (int i = 0; i < selection.length; i++) {
     selection[i] = table.convertRowIndexToModel(selection[i]);
   }
   // selection is now in terms of the underlying TableModel
```

By default if sorting is enabled `JTable` will persist the
selection and variable row heights in terms of the model on
sorting. For example if row 0, in terms of the underlying model,
is currently selected, after the sort row 0, in terms of the
underlying model will be selected. Visually the selection may
change, but in terms of the underlying model it will remain the
same. The one exception to that is if the model index is no longer
visible or was removed. For example, if row 0 in terms of model
was filtered out the selection will be empty after the sort.

J2SE 5 adds methods to `JTable` to provide convenient access to some
common printing needs. Simple new [`print()`](#print()) methods allow for quick
and easy addition of printing support to your application. In addition, a new
[`getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode, java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat)`](#getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode,java.text.MessageFormat,java.text.MessageFormat)) method is available for more advanced printing needs.

As for all `JComponent` classes, you can use
[`InputMap`](InputMap.md "class in javax.swing") and [`ActionMap`](ActionMap.md "class in javax.swing") to associate an
[`Action`](Action.md "interface in javax.swing") object with a [`KeyStroke`](KeyStroke.md "class in javax.swing") and execute the
action under specified conditions.

**Warning:** Swing is not thread safe. For more
information see [Swing's Threading
Policy](package-summary.md#threading).

**Warning:**
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans
has been added to the `java.beans` package.
Please see [`XMLEncoder`](../../java/beans/XMLEncoder.md "class in java.beans").

* ## Method Details

  + ### addNotify

    public void addNotify()

    Calls the `configureEnclosingScrollPane` method.

    Overrides:
    :   `addNotify` in class `JComponent`

    See Also:
    :   - [`configureEnclosingScrollPane()`](#configureEnclosingScrollPane())
  + ### configureEnclosingScrollPane

    protected void configureEnclosingScrollPane()

    If this `JTable` is the `viewportView` of an enclosing `JScrollPane`
    (the usual situation), configure this `ScrollPane` by, amongst other things,
    installing the table's `tableHeader` as the `columnHeaderView` of the scroll pane.
    When a `JTable` is added to a `JScrollPane` in the usual way,
    using `new JScrollPane(myTable)`, `addNotify` is
    called in the `JTable` (when the table is added to the viewport).
    `JTable`'s `addNotify` method in turn calls this method,
    which is protected so that this default installation procedure can
    be overridden by a subclass.

    See Also:
    :   - [`addNotify()`](#addNotify())
  + ### removeNotify

    public void removeNotify()

    Calls the `unconfigureEnclosingScrollPane` method.

    Overrides:
    :   `removeNotify` in class `JComponent`

    See Also:
    :   - [`unconfigureEnclosingScrollPane()`](#unconfigureEnclosingScrollPane())
  + ### unconfigureEnclosingScrollPane

    protected void unconfigureEnclosingScrollPane()

    Reverses the effect of `configureEnclosingScrollPane`
    by replacing the `columnHeaderView` of the enclosing
    scroll pane with `null`. `JTable`'s
    `removeNotify` method calls
    this method, which is protected so that this default uninstallation
    procedure can be overridden by a subclass.

    Since:
    :   1.3

    See Also:
    :   - [`removeNotify()`](#removeNotify())
        - [`configureEnclosingScrollPane()`](#configureEnclosingScrollPane())

    Sets a default cell renderer to be used if no renderer has been set in
    a `TableColumn`. If renderer is `null`,
    removes the default renderer for this column class.

    Parameters:
    :   `columnClass` - set the default cell renderer for this columnClass

    public [TableCellRenderer](table/TableCellRenderer.md "interface in javax.swing.table") getDefaultRenderer([Class](../../../java.base/java/lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<?> columnClass)

    Returns the cell renderer to be used when no renderer has been set in
    a `TableColumn`. During the rendering of cells the renderer is fetched from
    a `Hashtable` of entries according to the class of the cells in the column. If
    there is no entry for this `columnClass` the method returns
    the entry for the most specific superclass. The `JTable` installs entries
    for `Object`, `Number`, and `Boolean`, all of which can be modified
    or replaced.

    Sets a default cell editor to be used if no editor has been set in
    a `TableColumn`. If no editing is required in a table, or a
    particular column in a table, uses the `isCellEditable`
    method in the `TableModel` interface to ensure that this
    `JTable` will not start an editor in these columns.
    If editor is `null`, removes the default editor for this
    column class.

    Parameters:
    :   `columnClass` - set the default cell editor for this columnClass

    a `TableColumn`. During the editing of cells the editor is fetched from
    a `Hashtable` of entries according to the class of the cells in the column. If
    there is no entry for this `columnClass` the method returns
    the entry for the most specific superclass. The `JTable` installs entries

    [description](../../java/beans/BeanProperty.md#description())="determines whether automatic drag handling is enabled")
    public void setDragEnabled(boolean b)

    Turns on or off automatic drag handling. In order to enable automatic
    drag handling, this property should be set to `true`, and the
    table's `TransferHandler` needs to be `non-null`.
    The default value of the `dragEnabled` property is `false`.

    The job of honoring this property, and recognizing a user drag gesture,
    lies with the look and feel implementation, and in particular, the table's
    `TableUI`. When automatic drag handling is enabled, most look and
    feels (including those that subclass `BasicLookAndFeel`) begin a
    drag and drop operation whenever the user presses the mouse button over
    an item (in single selection mode) or a selection (in other selection
    modes) and then moves the mouse a few pixels. Setting this property to
    `true` can therefore have a subtle effect on how selections behave.

    If a look and feel is used that ignores this property, you can still
    begin a drag and drop operation by calling `exportAsDrag` on the
    table's `TransferHandler`.

    Parameters:
    :   `b` - whether or not to enable automatic drag handling

    Throws:
    :   `HeadlessException` - if
        `b` is `true` and
        `GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()`
        returns `true`

  + ### setDropMode

    public final void setDropMode([DropMode](DropMode.md "enum class in javax.swing") dropMode)

    Sets the drop mode for this component. For backward compatibility,
    the default for this property is `DropMode.USE_SELECTION`.
    Usage of one of the other modes is recommended, however, for an
    improved user experience. `DropMode.ON`, for instance,
    offers similar behavior of showing items as selected, but does so without
    affecting the actual selection in the table.

    `JTable` supports the following drop modes:
    - `DropMode.USE_SELECTION`
    - `DropMode.ON`
    - `DropMode.INSERT`
    - `DropMode.INSERT_ROWS`
    - `DropMode.INSERT_COLS`
    - `DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT`
    - `DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT_ROWS`
    - `DropMode.ON_OR_INSERT_COLS`

    The drop mode is only meaningful if this component has a
    `TransferHandler` that accepts drops.

    Parameters:
    :   `dropMode` - the drop mode to use

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the drop mode is unsupported
        or `null`

    Returns the location that this component should visually indicate
    as the drop location during a DnD operation over the component,
    or `null` if no location is to currently be shown.

    This method is not meant for querying the drop location
    from a `TransferHandler`, as the drop location is only
    set after the `TransferHandler`'s `canImport`
    has returned and has allowed for the location to be shown.

    When this property changes, a property change event with
    name "dropLocation" is fired by the component.

    public void setAutoCreateRowSorter(boolean autoCreateRowSorter)

    Specifies whether a `RowSorter` should be created for the
    table whenever its model changes.

    When `setAutoCreateRowSorter(true)` is invoked, a `TableRowSorter` is immediately created and installed on the
    table. While the `autoCreateRowSorter` property remains
    `true`, every time the model is changed, a new `TableRowSorter` is created and set as the table's row sorter.
    The default value for the `autoCreateRowSorter`
    property is `false`.

    Parameters:

    Sets the `RowSorter`. `RowSorter` is used
    to provide sorting and filtering to a `JTable`.

    This method clears the selection and resets any variable row heights.

    This method fires a `PropertyChangeEvent` when appropriate,
    with the property name `"rowSorter"`. For

    property name `"sorter"`.

    If the underlying model of the `RowSorter` differs from
    that of this `JTable` undefined behavior will result.

    Parameters:
    :   `sorter` - the `RowSorter`; `null` turns

    Sets the table's selection mode to allow only single selections, a single
    contiguous interval, or multiple intervals.

    **Note:**
    `JTable` provides all the methods for handling
    column and row selection. When setting states,
    such as `setSelectionMode`, it not only
    updates the mode for the row selection model but also sets similar
    values in the selection model of the `columnModel`.
    If you want to have the row and column selection models operating
    in different modes, set them both directly.

    Both the row and column selection models for `JTable`
    default to using a `DefaultListSelectionModel`
    so that `JTable` works the same way as the
    `JList`. See the `setSelectionMode` method
    in `JList` for details about the modes.

    Parameters:
    :   `selectionMode` - the mode used by the row and column selection models

    [description](../../java/beans/BeanProperty.md#description())="If true, an entire row is selected for each selected cell.")
    public void setRowSelectionAllowed(boolean rowSelectionAllowed)

    Sets whether the rows in this model can be selected.

    Parameters:
    :   `rowSelectionAllowed` - true if this model will allow row selection

    See Also:
    :   - [`getRowSelectionAllowed()`](#getRowSelectionAllowed())
  + ### getRowSelectionAllowed

    public boolean getRowSelectionAllowed()

    Returns true if rows can be selected.

    [description](../../java/beans/BeanProperty.md#description())="Select a rectangular region of cells rather than rows or columns.")
    public void setCellSelectionEnabled(boolean cellSelectionEnabled)

    Sets whether this table allows both a column selection and a
    row selection to exist simultaneously. When set,
    the table treats the intersection of the row and column selection
    models as the selected cells. Override `isCellSelected` to
    change this default behavior. This method is equivalent to setting
    both the `rowSelectionAllowed` property and
    `columnSelectionAllowed` property of the
    `columnModel` to the supplied value.

    Parameters:
    :   `cellSelectionEnabled` - true if simultaneous row and column
        selection is allowed

  + ### changeSelection

    public void changeSelection(int rowIndex,
    int columnIndex,
    boolean toggle,
    boolean extend)

    Updates the selection models of the table, depending on the state of the
    two flags: `toggle` and `extend`. Most changes
    to the selection that are the result of keyboard or mouse events received
    by the UI are channeled through this method so that the behavior may be
    overridden by a subclass. Some UIs may need more functionality than
    this method provides, such as when manipulating the lead for discontiguous
    selection, and may not call into this method for some selection changes.

    This implementation uses the following conventions:
    - `toggle`: *false*, `extend`: *false*.
      Clear the previous selection and ensure the new cell is selected.- `toggle`: *false*, `extend`: *true*.
        Extend the previous selection from the anchor to the specified cell,
        clearing all other selections.- `toggle`: *true*, `extend`: *false*.
          If the specified cell is selected, deselect it. If it is not selected, select it.- `toggle`: *true*, `extend`: *true*.
            Apply the selection state of the anchor to all cells between it and the
            specified cell.

    Parameters:
    :   `rowIndex` - affects the selection at `row`
    :   `columnIndex` - affects the selection at `column`
    :   `toggle` - see description above
    :   `extend` - if true, extend the current selection

    Since:
    :   1.3

    int column)

    Returns the cell value at `row` and `column`.

    **Note**: The column is specified in the table view's display
    order, and not in the `TableModel`'s column
    order. This is an important distinction because as the
    user rearranges the columns in the table,
    the column at a given index in the view will change.
    Meanwhile the user's actions never affect the model's
    column ordering.

    Parameters:
    :   `row` - the row whose value is to be queried
    :   `column` - the column whose value is to be queried

    Returns:

    Sets the value for the cell in the table model at `row`
    and `column`.

    **Note**: The column is specified in the table view's display
    order, and not in the `TableModel`'s column
    order. This is an important distinction because as the
    user rearranges the columns in the table,
    the column at a given index in the view will change.
    Meanwhile the user's actions never affect the model's
    column ordering.
    `aValue` is the new value.

    Parameters:
    :   `aValue` - the new value
    :   `row` - the row of the cell to be changed
    :   `column` - the column of the cell to be changed

    See Also:
    :   - [`getValueAt(int, int)`](#getValueAt(int,int))
  + ### isCellEditable

    public boolean isCellEditable(int row,
    int column)

    Returns true if the cell at `row` and `column`
    is editable. Otherwise, invoking `setValueAt` on the cell
    will have no effect.

    **Note**: The column is specified in the table view's display
    order, and not in the `TableModel`'s column
    order. This is an important distinction because as the
    user rearranges the columns in the table,
    the column at a given index in the view will change.
    Meanwhile the user's actions never affect the model's
    column ordering.

    Parameters:
    :   `row` - the row whose value is to be queried
    :   `column` - the column whose value is to be queried

    Returns:
    :   true if the cell is editable

  + ### addColumn

    public void addColumn([TableColumn](table/TableColumn.md "class in javax.swing.table") aColumn)

    Appends `aColumn` to the end of the array of columns held by
    this `JTable`'s column model.
    If the column name of `aColumn` is `null`,
    sets the column name of `aColumn` to the name
    returned by `getModel().getColumnName()`.

    To add a column to this `JTable` to display the
    `modelColumn`'th column of data in the model with a
    given `width`, `cellRenderer`,
    and `cellEditor` you can use:

    ```
          addColumn(new TableColumn(modelColumn, width, cellRenderer, cellEditor));
    ```

    [Any of the `TableColumn` constructors can be used
    instead of this one.]
    The model column number is stored inside the `TableColumn`
    and is used during rendering and editing to locate the appropriates
    data values in the model. The model column number does not change
    when columns are reordered in the view.

    Parameters:
    :   `aColumn` - the `TableColumn` to be added

    See Also:
    :   - [`removeColumn(javax.swing.table.TableColumn)`](#removeColumn(javax.swing.table.TableColumn))
  + ### removeColumn

    public void removeColumn([TableColumn](table/TableColumn.md "class in javax.swing.table") aColumn)

    Removes `aColumn` from this `JTable`'s
    array of columns. Note: this method does not remove the column
    of data from the model; it just removes the `TableColumn`
    that was responsible for displaying it.

    Parameters:
    :   `aColumn` - the `TableColumn` to be removed

    :   - [`addColumn(javax.swing.table.TableColumn)`](#addColumn(javax.swing.table.TableColumn))
  + ### moveColumn

    public void moveColumn(int column,
    int targetColumn)

    Moves the column `column` to the position currently
    occupied by the column `targetColumn` in the view.
    The old column at `targetColumn` is
    shifted left or right to make room.

    Parameters:
    :   `column` - the index of column to be moved
    :   `targetColumn` - the new index of the column
  + ### columnAtPoint

    public int columnAtPoint([Point](../../java/awt/Point.md "class in java.awt") point)

    Returns the index of the column that `point` lies in,
    or -1 if the result is not in the range
    [0, `getColumnCount()`-1].

    Parameters:
    :   `point` - the location of interest

    Returns:
    :   the index of the column that `point` lies in,
        or -1 if the result is not in the range
        [0, `getColumnCount()`-1]

    See Also:
    :   - [`rowAtPoint(java.awt.Point)`](#rowAtPoint(java.awt.Point))
  + ### rowAtPoint

    public int rowAtPoint([Point](../../java/awt/Point.md "class in java.awt") point)

    Returns the index of the row that `point` lies in,
    or -1 if the result is not in the range
    [0, `getRowCount()`-1].

    Parameters:
    :   `point` - the location of interest

    Returns:
    :   the index of the row that `point` lies in,
        or -1 if the result is not in the range
        [0, `getRowCount()`-1]

    See Also:
    :   - [`columnAtPoint(java.awt.Point)`](#columnAtPoint(java.awt.Point))
  + ### getCellRect

    public [Rectangle](../../java/awt/Rectangle.md "class in java.awt") getCellRect(int row,
    int column,
    boolean includeSpacing)

    Returns a rectangle for the cell that lies at the intersection of
    `row` and `column`.
    If `includeSpacing` is true then the value returned
    has the full height and width of the row and column
    specified. If it is false, the returned rectangle is inset by the
    intercell spacing to return the true bounds of the rendering or
    editing component as it will be set during rendering.

    If the column index is valid but the row index is less
    than zero the method returns a rectangle with the
    `y` and `height` values set appropriately
    and the `x` and `width` values both set
    to zero. In general, when either the row or column indices indicate a
    cell outside the appropriate range, the method returns a rectangle
    depicting the closest edge of the closest cell that is within
    the table's range. When both row and column indices are out
    of range the returned rectangle covers the closest
    point of the closest cell.

    In all cases, calculations that use this method to calculate
    results along one axis will not fail because of anomalies in
    calculations along the other axis. When the cell is not valid
    the `includeSpacing` parameter is ignored.

    Parameters:
    :   `row` - the row index where the desired cell
        is located
    :   `column` - the column index where the desired cell
        is located in the display; this is not
        necessarily the same as the column index
        in the data model for the table; the
        [`convertColumnIndexToView(int)`](#convertColumnIndexToView(int))
        method may be used to convert a data
        model column index to a display
        column index
    :   `includeSpacing` - if false, return the true cell bounds -
        computed by subtracting the intercell
        spacing from the height and widths of
        the column and row models

    Returns:
    :   the rectangle containing the cell at location
        `row`,`column`

  + ### doLayout

    public void doLayout()

    Causes this table to lay out its rows and columns. Overridden so
    that columns can be resized to accommodate a change in the size of
    a containing parent.
    Resizes one or more of the columns in the table
    so that the total width of all of this `JTable`'s
    columns is equal to the width of the table.

    Before the layout begins the method gets the
    `resizingColumn` of the `tableHeader`.
    When the method is called as a result of the resizing of an enclosing window,
    the `resizingColumn` is `null`. This means that resizing
    has taken place "outside" the `JTable` and the change -
    or "delta" - should be distributed to all of the columns regardless
    of this `JTable`'s automatic resize mode.

    If the `resizingColumn` is not `null`, it is one of
    the columns in the table that has changed size rather than
    the table itself. In this case the auto-resize modes govern
    the way the extra (or deficit) space is distributed
    amongst the available columns.

    The modes are:
    - AUTO\_RESIZE\_OFF: Don't automatically adjust the column's
      widths at all. Use a horizontal scrollbar to accommodate the
      columns when their sum exceeds the width of the
      `Viewport`. If the `JTable` is not
      enclosed in a `JScrollPane` this may
      leave parts of the table invisible.- AUTO\_RESIZE\_NEXT\_COLUMN: Use just the column after the
        resizing column. This results in the "boundary" or divider
        between adjacent cells being independently adjustable.- AUTO\_RESIZE\_SUBSEQUENT\_COLUMNS: Use all columns after the
          one being adjusted to absorb the changes. This is the
          default behavior.- AUTO\_RESIZE\_LAST\_COLUMN: Automatically adjust the
            size of the last column only. If the bounds of the last column
            prevent the desired size from being allocated, set the
            width of the last column to the appropriate limit and make
            no further adjustments.- AUTO\_RESIZE\_ALL\_COLUMNS: Spread the delta amongst all the columns
              in the `JTable`, including the one that is being
              adjusted.

    **Note:** When a `JTable` makes adjustments
    to the widths of the columns it respects their minimum and
    maximum values absolutely. It is therefore possible that,
    even after this method is called, the total width of the columns
    is still not equal to the width of the table. When this happens
    the `JTable` does not put itself
    in AUTO\_RESIZE\_OFF mode to bring up a scroll bar, or break other
    commitments of its current auto-resize mode -- instead it
    allows its bounds to be set larger (or smaller) than the total of the
    column minimum or maximum, meaning, either that there
    will not be enough room to display all of the columns, or that the
    columns will not fill the `JTable`'s bounds.
    These respectively, result in the clipping of some columns
    or an area being painted in the `JTable`'s
    background color during painting.

    The mechanism for distributing the delta amongst the available
    columns is provided in a private method in the `JTable`
    class:

    ```
       adjustSizes(long targetSize, final Resizable3 r, boolean inverse)
    ```

    an explanation of which is provided in the following section.
    `Resizable3` is a private
    interface that allows any data structure containing a collection
    of elements with a size, preferred size, maximum size and minimum size
    to have its elements manipulated by the algorithm.

    #### Distributing the delta

    ##### Overview

    Call "DELTA" the difference between the target size and the
    sum of the preferred sizes of the elements in r. The individual
    sizes are calculated by taking the original preferred
    sizes and adding a share of the DELTA - that share being based on
    how far each preferred size is from its limiting bound (minimum or
    maximum).

    ##### Definition

    Call the individual constraints min[i], max[i], and pref[i].

    Call their respective sums: MIN, MAX, and PREF.

    Each new size will be calculated using:

    ```
              size[i] = pref[i] + delta[i]
    ```

    where each individual delta[i] is calculated according to:

    If (DELTA < 0) we are in shrink mode where:

    ```
                            DELTA
              delta[i] = ------------ * (pref[i] - min[i])
                         (PREF - MIN)
    ```

    If (DELTA > 0) we are in expand mode where:

    ```
                            DELTA
              delta[i] = ------------ * (max[i] - pref[i])
                          (MAX - PREF)
    ```

    The overall effect is that the total size moves that same percentage,
    k, towards the total minimum or maximum and that percentage guarantees
    accommodation of the required space, DELTA.

    ##### Details

    Naive evaluation of the formulae presented here would be subject to
    the aggregated rounding errors caused by doing this operation in finite
    precision (using ints). To deal with this, the multiplying factor above,
    is constantly recalculated and this takes account of the rounding
    errors in the previous iterations. The result is an algorithm that
    produces a set of integers whose values exactly sum to the supplied
    `targetSize`, and does so by spreading the rounding
    errors evenly over the given elements.

    ##### When the MAX and MIN bounds are hit

    When `targetSize` is outside the [MIN, MAX] range,
    the algorithm sets all sizes to their appropriate limiting value
    (maximum or minimum).

    public [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getToolTipText([MouseEvent](../../java/awt/event/MouseEvent.md "class in java.awt.event") event)

    Overrides `JComponent`'s `getToolTipText`
    method in order to allow the renderer's tips to be used
    if it has text set.

    **Note:** For `JTable` to properly display

    `JTable` must be a registered component with the
    `ToolTipManager`.
    This is done automatically in `initializeLocalVars`,
    but if at a later point `JTable` is told
    `setToolTipText(null)` it will unregister the table
    component, and no tips from renderers will display anymore.

    and returns the default renderer for this type of data.

    **Note:**
    Throughout the table package, the internal implementations always
    use this method to provide renderers so that this default behavior
    can be safely overridden by a subclass.

    Parameters:
    :   `row` - the row of the cell to render, where 0 is the first row
    :   `column` - the column of the cell to render,
        where 0 is the first column

    int row,
    int column)

    Prepares the renderer by querying the data model for the
    value and selection state
    of the cell at `row`, `column`.
    Returns the component (may be a `Component`
    or a `JComponent`) under the event location.

    During a printing operation, this method will configure the
    renderer without indicating selection or focus, to prevent
    them from appearing in the printed output. To do other
    customizations based on whether or not the table is being
    printed, you can check the value of
    [`JComponent.isPaintingForPrint()`](JComponent.md#isPaintingForPrint()), either here
    or within custom renderers.

    **Note:**
    Throughout the table package, the internal implementations always
    use this method to prepare renderers so that this default behavior
    can be safely overridden by a subclass.

    Parameters:
    :   `renderer` - the `TableCellRenderer` to prepare
    :   `row` - the row of the cell to render, where 0 is the first row
    :   `column` - the column of the cell to render,

    int column)

    Returns an appropriate editor for the cell specified by
    `row` and `column`. If the
    `TableColumn` for this column has a non-null editor,
    returns that. If not, finds the class of the data in this
    column (using `getColumnClass`)
    and returns the default editor for this type of data.

    **Note:**
    Throughout the table package, the internal implementations always
    use this method to provide editors so that this default behavior
    can be safely overridden by a subclass.

    Prints this `JTable`. Takes steps that the majority of
    developers would take in order to print a `JTable`.
    In short, it prepares the table, calls `getPrintable` to
    fetch an appropriate `Printable`, and then sends it to the
    printer.

    A `boolean` parameter allows you to specify whether or not
    a printing dialog is displayed to the user. When it is, the user may
    use the dialog to change the destination printer or printing attributes,
    or even to cancel the print. Another two parameters allow for a
    `PrintService` and printing attributes to be specified.
    These parameters can be used either to provide initial values for the
    print dialog, or to specify values when the dialog is not shown.

    A second `boolean` parameter allows you to specify whether
    or not to perform printing in an interactive mode. If `true`,
    a modal progress dialog, with an abort option, is displayed for the
    duration of printing . This dialog also prevents any user action which
    may affect the table. However, it can not prevent the table from being
    modified by code (for example, another thread that posts updates using
    `SwingUtilities.invokeLater`). It is therefore the
    responsibility of the developer to ensure that no other code modifies
    the table in any way during printing (invalid modifications include
    changes in: size, renderers, or underlying data). Printing behavior is
    undefined when the table is changed during printing.

    If `false` is specified for this parameter, no dialog will
    be displayed and printing will begin immediately on the event-dispatch
    thread. This blocks any other events, including repaints, from being
    processed until printing is complete. Although this effectively prevents
    the table from being changed, it doesn't provide a good user experience.
    For this reason, specifying `false` is only recommended when
    printing from an application with no visible GUI.

    Note: Attempting to show the printing dialog or run interactively, while
    in headless mode, will result in a `HeadlessException`.

    Before fetching the printable, this method will gracefully terminate
    editing, if necessary, to prevent an editor from showing in the printed
    result. Additionally, `JTable` will prepare its renderers
    during printing such that selection and focus are not indicated.
    As far as customizing further how the table looks in the printout,
    developers can provide custom renderers or paint code that conditionalize
    on the value of [`JComponent.isPaintingForPrint()`](JComponent.md#isPaintingForPrint()).

    See [`getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode, java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat)`](#getPrintable(javax.swing.JTable.PrintMode,java.text.MessageFormat,java.text.MessageFormat)) for more description on how the table is
    printed.

    Parameters:
    :   `printMode` - the printing mode that the printable should use
    :   `headerFormat` - a `MessageFormat` specifying the text
        to be used in printing a header,
        or `null` for none
    :   `footerFormat` - a `MessageFormat` specifying the text
        to be used in printing a footer,
        or `null` for none
    :   `showPrintDialog` - whether or not to display a print dialog
    :   `attr` - a `PrintRequestAttributeSet`
        specifying any printing attributes,
        or `null` for none
    :   `interactive` - whether or not to print in an interactive mode
    :   `service` - the destination `PrintService`,
        or `null` to use the default printer

    Returns:
    :   true, unless printing is cancelled by the user

    Throws:
    :   `HeadlessException` - if the method is asked to show a printing
        dialog or run interactively, and
        `GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless`
        returns `true`
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its
        [`SecurityManager.checkPrintJobAccess()`](../../../java.base/java/lang/SecurityManager.md#checkPrintJobAccess())

    public [Printable](../../java/awt/print/Printable.md "interface in java.awt.print") getPrintable([JTable.PrintMode](JTable.PrintMode.md "enum class in javax.swing") printMode,
    [MessageFormat](../../../java.base/java/text/MessageFormat.md "class in java.text") headerFormat,

    Return a `Printable` for use in printing this JTable.

    This method is meant for those wishing to customize the default
    `Printable` implementation used by `JTable`'s
    `print` methods. Developers wanting simply to print the table
    should use one of those methods directly.

    The `Printable` can be requested in one of two printing modes.
    In both modes, it spreads table rows naturally in sequence across
    multiple pages, fitting as many rows as possible per page.
    `PrintMode.NORMAL` specifies that the table be
    printed at its current size. In this mode, there may be a need to spread
    columns across pages in a similar manner to that of the rows. When the
    need arises, columns are distributed in an order consistent with the
    table's `ComponentOrientation`.
    `PrintMode.FIT_WIDTH` specifies that the output be
    scaled smaller, if necessary, to fit the table's entire width
    (and thereby all columns) on each page. Width and height are scaled
    equally, maintaining the aspect ratio of the output.

    The `Printable` heads the portion of table on each page
    with the appropriate section from the table's `JTableHeader`,
    if it has one.

    Header and footer text can be added to the output by providing
    `MessageFormat` arguments. The printing code requests
    Strings from the formats, providing a single item which may be included
    in the formatted string: an `Integer` representing the current
    page number.

    You are encouraged to read the documentation for
    `MessageFormat` as some characters, such as single-quote,
    are special and need to be escaped.

    Here's an example of creating a `MessageFormat` that can be
    used to print "Duke's Table: Page - " and the current page number:

    ```
         // notice the escaping of the single quote
         // notice how the page number is included with "{0}"
         MessageFormat format = new MessageFormat("Duke''s Table: Page - {0}");
    ```

    The `Printable` constrains what it draws to the printable
    area of each page that it prints. Under certain circumstances, it may
    find it impossible to fit all of a page's content into that area. In
    these cases the output may be clipped, but the implementation
    makes an effort to do something reasonable. Here are a few situations
    where this is known to occur, and how they may be handled by this
    particular implementation:
    - In any mode, when the header or footer text is too wide to fit
      completely in the printable area -- print as much of the text as
      possible starting from the beginning, as determined by the table's
      `ComponentOrientation`.- In any mode, when a row is too tall to fit in the
        printable area -- print the upper-most portion of the row
        and paint no lower border on the table.- In `PrintMode.NORMAL` when a column
          is too wide to fit in the printable area -- print the center
          portion of the column and leave the left and right borders
          off the table.

    It is entirely valid for this `Printable` to be wrapped
    inside another in order to create complex reports and documents. You may
    even request that different pages be rendered into different sized
    printable areas. The implementation must be prepared to handle this
    (possibly by doing its layout calculations on the fly). However,
    providing different heights to each page will likely not work well
    with `PrintMode.NORMAL` when it has to spread columns
    across pages.

    As far as customizing how the table looks in the printed result,
    `JTable` itself will take care of hiding the selection
    and focus during printing. For additional customizations, your
    renderers or painting code can customize the look based on the value
    of [`JComponent.isPaintingForPrint()`](JComponent.md#isPaintingForPrint())

    Also, *before* calling this method you may wish to *first*
    modify the state of the table, such as to cancel cell editing or
    have the user size the table appropriately. However, you must not
    modify the state of the table *after* this `Printable`
    has been fetched (invalid modifications include changes in size or
    underlying data). The behavior of the returned `Printable`
    is undefined once the table has been changed.

    Parameters:
    :   `printMode` - the printing mode that the printable should use
    :   `headerFormat` - a `MessageFormat` specifying the text to
        be used in printing a header, or null for none
    :   `footerFormat` - a `MessageFormat` specifying the text to
        be used in printing a footer, or null for none

    Returns:
    :   a `Printable` for printing this JTable
