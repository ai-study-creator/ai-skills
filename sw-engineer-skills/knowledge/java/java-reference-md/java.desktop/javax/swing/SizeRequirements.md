# Class SizeRequirements

[java.lang.Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

javax.swing.SizeRequirements

All Implemented Interfaces:
:   `Serializable`

---

public class SizeRequirements
extends [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Serializable](../../../java.base/java/io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io")

For the convenience of layout managers,
calculates information about the size and position of components.
All size and position calculation methods are class methods
that take arrays of SizeRequirements as arguments.
The SizeRequirements class supports two types of layout:
> tiled: The components are placed end-to-end, starting either at coordinate 0 (the leftmost or topmost position) or at the coordinate representing the end of the allocated span (the rightmost or bottommost position). aligned: The components are aligned as specified by each component's X or Y alignment value.

Each SizeRequirements object contains information
about either the width (and X alignment)
or height (and Y alignment)
of a single component or a group of components:
> `minimum`: The smallest reasonable width/height of the component or component group, in pixels. `preferred`: The natural width/height of the component or component group, in pixels. `maximum`: The largest reasonable width/height of the component or component group, in pixels. `alignment`: The X/Y alignment of the component or component group.

**Warning:**
Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with
future Swing releases. The current serialization support is
appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running
the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage
of all JavaBeans
has been added to the `java.beans` package.
Please see [`XMLEncoder`](../../java/beans/XMLEncoder.md "class in java.beans").

  + ### calculateTiledPositions

    public static void calculateTiledPositions(int allocated,
    [SizeRequirements](SizeRequirements.md "class in javax.swing") total,
    [SizeRequirements](SizeRequirements.md "class in javax.swing")[] children,
    int[] offsets,
    int[] spans)

    Creates a set of offset/span pairs representing how to
    lay out a set of components end-to-end.
    This method requires that you specify
    the total amount of space to be allocated,
    the size requirements for each component to be placed
    (specified as an array of SizeRequirements), and
    the total size requirement of the set of components.
    You can get the total size requirement
    by invoking the getTiledSizeRequirements method. The components
    will be tiled in the forward direction with offsets increasing from 0.

    Parameters:
    :   `allocated` - the total span to be allocated >= 0.
    :   `total` - the total of the children requests. This argument
        is optional and may be null.
    :   `children` - the size requirements for each component.
    :   `offsets` - the offset from 0 for each child where
        the spans were allocated (determines placement of the span).
    :   `spans` - the span allocated for each child to make the
        total target span.
  + ### calculateTiledPositions

    public static void calculateTiledPositions(int allocated,
    [SizeRequirements](SizeRequirements.md "class in javax.swing") total,
    [SizeRequirements](SizeRequirements.md "class in javax.swing")[] children,
    int[] offsets,
    int[] spans,
    boolean forward)

    Creates a set of offset/span pairs representing how to
    lay out a set of components end-to-end.
    This method requires that you specify
    the total amount of space to be allocated,
    the size requirements for each component to be placed
    (specified as an array of SizeRequirements), and
    the total size requirement of the set of components.
    You can get the total size requirement
    by invoking the getTiledSizeRequirements method.
    This method also requires a flag indicating whether components
    should be tiled in the forward direction (offsets increasing
    from 0) or reverse direction (offsets decreasing from the end
    of the allocated space). The forward direction represents
    components tiled from left to right or top to bottom. The
    reverse direction represents components tiled from right to left
    or bottom to top.

    Parameters:
    :   `allocated` - the total span to be allocated >= 0.
    :   `total` - the total of the children requests. This argument
        is optional and may be null.
    :   `children` - the size requirements for each component.
    :   `offsets` - the offset from 0 for each child where
        the spans were allocated (determines placement of the span).
    :   `spans` - the span allocated for each child to make the
        total target span.
    :   `forward` - tile with offsets increasing from 0 if true
        and with offsets decreasing from the end of the allocated space
        if false.

  + ### calculateAlignedPositions

    public static void calculateAlignedPositions(int allocated,
    [SizeRequirements](SizeRequirements.md "class in javax.swing") total,
    [SizeRequirements](SizeRequirements.md "class in javax.swing")[] children,
    int[] offsets,
    int[] spans)

    Creates a bunch of offset/span pairs specifying how to
    lay out a set of components with the specified alignments.
    The resulting span allocations will overlap, with each one
    fitting as well as possible into the given total allocation.
    This method requires that you specify
    the total amount of space to be allocated,
    the size requirements for each component to be placed
    (specified as an array of SizeRequirements), and
    the total size requirements of the set of components
    (only the alignment field of which is actually used).
    You can get the total size requirement by invoking
    getAlignedSizeRequirements.
    Normal alignment will be done with an alignment value of 0.0f
    representing the left/top edge of a component.

    Parameters:
    :   `allocated` - the total span to be allocated >= 0.
    :   `total` - the total of the children requests.
    :   `children` - the size requirements for each component.
    :   `offsets` - the offset from 0 for each child where
        the spans were allocated (determines placement of the span).
    :   `spans` - the span allocated for each child to make the
        total target span.
  + ### calculateAlignedPositions

    public static void calculateAlignedPositions(int allocated,
    [SizeRequirements](SizeRequirements.md "class in javax.swing") total,
    [SizeRequirements](SizeRequirements.md "class in javax.swing")[] children,
    int[] offsets,
    int[] spans,
    boolean normal)

    Creates a set of offset/span pairs specifying how to
    lay out a set of components with the specified alignments.
    The resulting span allocations will overlap, with each one
    fitting as well as possible into the given total allocation.
    This method requires that you specify
    the total amount of space to be allocated,
    the size requirements for each component to be placed
    (specified as an array of SizeRequirements), and
    the total size requirements of the set of components
    (only the alignment field of which is actually used)
    You can get the total size requirement by invoking
    getAlignedSizeRequirements.
    This method also requires a flag indicating whether normal or
    reverse alignment should be performed. With normal alignment
    the value 0.0f represents the left/top edge of the component
    to be aligned. With reverse alignment, 0.0f represents the
    right/bottom edge.

    Parameters:
    :   `allocated` - the total span to be allocated >= 0.
    :   `total` - the total of the children requests.
    :   `children` - the size requirements for each component.
