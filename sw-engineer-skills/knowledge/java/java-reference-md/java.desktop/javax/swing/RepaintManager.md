# Class RepaintManager

[java.lang.Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

javax.swing.RepaintManager

---

public class RepaintManager
extends [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

This class manages repaint requests, allowing the number
of repaints to be minimized, for example by collapsing multiple
requests into a single repaint for members of a component tree.

As of 1.6 `RepaintManager` handles repaint requests
for Swing's top level components (`JApplet`,
`JWindow`, `JFrame` and `JDialog`).
Any calls to `repaint` on one of these will call into the
appropriate `addDirtyRegion` method.

Since:
:   1.2

* ## Constructor Details

  + ### RepaintManager

    public RepaintManager()

    Create a new RepaintManager instance. You rarely call this constructor.
    directly. To get the default RepaintManager, use
    RepaintManager.currentManager(JComponent) (normally "this").
* ## Method Details

  + ### currentManager

    public static [RepaintManager](RepaintManager.md "class in javax.swing") currentManager([Component](../../java/awt/Component.md "class in java.awt") c)

    Return the RepaintManager for the calling thread given a Component.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - a Component -- unused in the default implementation, but could
        be used by an overridden version to return a different RepaintManager
        depending on the Component

    Returns:
    :   the RepaintManager object
  + ### currentManager

    public static [RepaintManager](RepaintManager.md "class in javax.swing") currentManager([JComponent](JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") c)

    Return the RepaintManager for the calling thread given a JComponent.

    Note: This method exists for backward binary compatibility with earlier
    versions of the Swing library. It simply returns the result returned by
    [`currentManager(Component)`](#currentManager(java.awt.Component)).

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - a JComponent -- unused

    Returns:
    :   the RepaintManager object
  + ### setCurrentManager

    public static void setCurrentManager([RepaintManager](RepaintManager.md "class in javax.swing") aRepaintManager)

    Set the RepaintManager that should be used for the calling
    thread. **aRepaintManager** will become the current RepaintManager
    for the calling thread's thread group.

    Parameters:
    :   `aRepaintManager` - the RepaintManager object to use
  + ### addInvalidComponent

    public void addInvalidComponent([JComponent](JComponent.md "class in javax.swing") invalidComponent)

    Mark the component as in need of layout and queue a runnable
    for the event dispatching thread that will validate the components
    first isValidateRoot() ancestor.

    Parameters:
    :   `invalidComponent` - a component

    Return the offscreen buffer that should be used as a double buffer with
    the component `c`.
    By default there is a double buffer per RepaintManager.
    The buffer might be smaller than `(proposedWidth,proposedHeight)`
    This happens when the maximum double buffer size as been set for the receiving
    repaint manager.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - the component

    Return a volatile offscreen buffer that should be used as a
    double buffer with the specified component `c`.
    The image returned will be an instance of VolatileImage, or null
    if a VolatileImage object could not be instantiated.
    This buffer might be smaller than `(proposedWidth,proposedHeight)`.

  + ### setDoubleBufferingEnabled

    public void setDoubleBufferingEnabled(boolean aFlag)

    Enables or disables double buffering in this RepaintManager.
    CAUTION: The default value for this property is set for optimal
    paint performance on the given platform and it is not recommended
    that programs modify this property directly.

    Parameters:
    :   `aFlag` - true to activate double buffering

    See Also:
    :   - [`isDoubleBufferingEnabled()`](#isDoubleBufferingEnabled())
  + ### isDoubleBufferingEnabled

    public boolean isDoubleBufferingEnabled()

    Returns true if this RepaintManager is double buffered.
    The default value for this property may vary from platform
    to platform. On platforms where native double buffering
    is supported in the AWT, the default value will be `false`
    to avoid unnecessary buffering in Swing.
    On platforms where native double buffering is not supported,
    the default value will be `true`.

    Returns:
    :   true if this object is double buffered
