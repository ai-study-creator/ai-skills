public class ReverbType
extends [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

The `ReverbType` class provides methods for accessing various
reverberation settings to be applied to an audio signal.

Reverberation simulates the reflection of sound off of the walls, ceiling,
and floor of a room. Depending on the size of the room, and how absorbent or
reflective the materials in the room's surfaces are, the sound might bounce
around for a long time before dying away.

The reverberation parameters provided by `ReverbType` consist of the
delay time and intensity of early reflections, the delay time and intensity
of late reflections, and an overall decay time. Early reflections are the
initial individual low-order reflections of the direct signal off the
surfaces in the room. The late reflections are the dense, high-order
reflections that characterize the room's reverberation. The delay times for
the start of these two reflection types give the listener a sense of the
overall size and complexity of the room's shape and contents. The larger the
room, the longer the reflection delay times. The early and late reflections'
intensities define the gain (in decibels) of the reflected signals as
compared to the direct signal. These intensities give the listener an
impression of the absorptive nature of the surfaces and objects in the room.
The decay time defines how long the reverberation takes to exponentially
decay until it is no longer perceptible ("effective zero"). The larger and
less absorbent the surfaces, the longer the decay time.

The set of parameters defined here may not include all aspects of
reverberation as specified by some systems. For example, the Midi
Manufacturer's Association (MMA) has an Interactive Audio Special Interest
Group (IASIG), which has a 3-D Working Group that has defined a Level 2 Spec
(I3DL2). I3DL2 supports filtering of reverberation and control of reverb
density. These properties are not included in the JavaSound 1.0 definition of
a reverb control. In such a case, the implementing system should either
extend the defined reverb control to include additional parameters, or else
interpret the system's additional capabilities in a way that fits the model
described here.

If implementing JavaSound on a I3DL2-compliant device:

* Filtering is disabled (high-frequency attenuations are set to 0.0 dB)* Density parameters are set to midway between minimum and maximum

The following table shows what parameter values an implementation might use
for a representative set of reverberation settings.
