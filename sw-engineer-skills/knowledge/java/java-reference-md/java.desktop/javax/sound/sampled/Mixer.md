public interface Mixer
extends [Line](Line.md "interface in javax.sound.sampled")

A mixer is an audio device with one or more lines. It need not be designed
for mixing audio signals. A mixer that actually mixes audio has multiple
input (source) lines and at least one output (target) line. The former are
often instances of classes that implement [`SourceDataLine`](SourceDataLine.md "interface in javax.sound.sampled"), and the
latter, [`TargetDataLine`](TargetDataLine.md "interface in javax.sound.sampled"). [`Port`](Port.md "interface in javax.sound.sampled") objects, too, are either source
lines or target lines. A mixer can accept prerecorded, loopable sound as
input, by having some of its source lines be instances of objects that
implement the [`Clip`](Clip.md "interface in javax.sound.sampled") interface.

Through methods of the `Line` interface, which `Mixer` extends, a
mixer might provide a set of controls that are global to the mixer. For
example, the mixer can have a master gain control. These global controls are
distinct from the controls belonging to each of the mixer's individual lines.

Some mixers, especially those with internal digital mixing capabilities, may
provide additional capabilities by implementing the `DataLine`
interface.

A mixer can support synchronization of its lines. When one line in a
synchronized group is started or stopped, the other lines in the group
automatically start or stop simultaneously with the explicitly affected one.

    Indicates whether the mixer supports a line (or lines) that match the
    specified `Line.Info` object. Some lines may only be supported when
    this mixer is open.

    Parameters:
    :   `info` - describes the line for which support is queried

    Returns:
    :   `true` if at least one matching line is supported,
        `false` otherwise

    [Line](Line.md "interface in javax.sound.sampled") getLine([Line.Info](Line.Info.md "class in javax.sound.sampled") info)
    throws [LineUnavailableException](LineUnavailableException.md "class in javax.sound.sampled")

    Obtains a line that is available for use and that matches the description
    in the specified `Line.Info` object.

    If a `DataLine` is requested, and `info` is an instance of
    `DataLine.Info` specifying at least one fully qualified audio
    format, the last one will be used as the default format of the returned
    `DataLine`.

    Parameters:
    :   `info` - describes the desired line

    Returns:
    :   a line that is available for use and that matches the description
        in the specified `Line.Info` object

    Throws:
    :   `LineUnavailableException` - if a matching line is not available due
        to resource restrictions
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if this mixer does not support any lines
        matching the description
    :   `SecurityException` - if a matching line is not available due to
        security restrictions
  + ### getMaxLines

    int getMaxLines([Line.Info](Line.Info.md "class in javax.sound.sampled") info)

    Obtains the approximate maximum number of lines of the requested type
    that can be open simultaneously on the mixer.

    Certain types of mixers do not have a hard bound and may allow opening
    more lines. Since certain lines are a shared resource, a mixer may not be
    able to open the maximum number of lines if another process has opened
    lines of this mixer.

    The requested type is any line that matches the description in the
    provided `Line.Info` object. For example, if the info object
    represents a speaker port, and the mixer supports exactly one speaker
    port, this method should return 1. If the info object represents a source
    data line and the mixer supports the use of 32 source data lines
    simultaneously, the return value should be 32. If there is no limit, this
    function returns [`AudioSystem.NOT_SPECIFIED`](AudioSystem.md#NOT_SPECIFIED).

    Parameters:
    :   `info` - a `Line.Info` that describes the line for which the
        number of supported instances is queried

    Returns:
    :   the maximum number of matching lines supported, or
        `AudioSystem.NOT_SPECIFIED`
  + ### getSourceLines

    [Line](Line.md "interface in javax.sound.sampled")[] getSourceLines()

    Obtains the set of all source lines currently open to this mixer.

    Returns:
    :   the source lines currently open to the mixer. If no source lines
        are currently open to this mixer, an array of length 0 is
        returned.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if the matching lines are not available due to
        security restrictions
  + ### getTargetLines

    [Line](Line.md "interface in javax.sound.sampled")[] getTargetLines()

    Obtains the set of all target lines currently open from this mixer.

    Returns:
    :   target lines currently open from the mixer. If no target lines
        are currently open from this mixer, an array of length 0 is
        returned.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if the matching lines are not available due to
        security restrictions
  + ### synchronize

    void synchronize([Line](Line.md "interface in javax.sound.sampled")[] lines,
    boolean maintainSync)

    Synchronizes two or more lines. Any subsequent command that starts or
    stops audio playback or capture for one of these lines will exert the
    same effect on the other lines in the group, so that they start or stop
    playing or capturing data simultaneously.

    Parameters:
    :   `lines` - the lines that should be synchronized
    :   `maintainSync` - `true` if the synchronization must be
        precisely maintained (i.e., the synchronization must be
        sample-accurate) at all times during operation of the lines, or
        `false` if precise synchronization is required only during
        start and stop operations

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the lines cannot be synchronized.
        This may occur if the lines are of different types or have
        different formats for which this mixer does not support
        synchronization, or if all lines specified do not belong to this
        mixer.
  + ### unsynchronize

    void unsynchronize([Line](Line.md "interface in javax.sound.sampled")[] lines)

    Releases synchronization for the specified lines. The array must be
    identical to one for which synchronization has already been established;
    otherwise an exception may be thrown. However, `null` may be
    specified, in which case all currently synchronized lines that belong to
    this mixer are unsynchronized.

    Parameters:
    :   `lines` - the synchronized lines for which synchronization should be
        released, or `null` for all this mixer's synchronized lines

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the lines cannot be unsynchronized.
        This may occur if the argument specified does not exactly match a
        set of lines for which synchronization has already been
        established.
  + ### isSynchronizationSupported

    boolean isSynchronizationSupported([Line](Line.md "interface in javax.sound.sampled")[] lines,
    boolean maintainSync)

    Reports whether this mixer supports synchronization of the specified set
    of lines.

    Parameters:
    :   `lines` - the set of lines for which synchronization support is
        queried
    :   `maintainSync` - `true` if the synchronization must be
        precisely maintained (i.e., the synchronization must be
        sample-accurate) at all times during operation of the lines, or
        `false` if precise synchronization is required only during
        start and stop operations

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the lines can be synchronized, `false`
        otherwise
