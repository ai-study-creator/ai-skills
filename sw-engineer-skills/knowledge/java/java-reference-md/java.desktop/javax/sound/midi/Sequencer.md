# Interface Sequencer

All Superinterfaces:
:   `AutoCloseable`, `MidiDevice`

---

public interface Sequencer
extends [MidiDevice](MidiDevice.md "interface in javax.sound.midi")

A hardware or software device that plays back a MIDI
[`sequence`](Sequence.md "class in javax.sound.midi") is known as a *sequencer*. A MIDI sequence
contains lists of time-stamped MIDI data, such as might be read from a
standard MIDI file. Most sequencers also provide functions for creating and
editing sequences.

The `Sequencer` interface includes methods for the following basic MIDI
sequencer operations:

* obtaining a sequence from MIDI file data* starting and stopping playback* moving to an arbitrary position in the sequence* changing the tempo (speed) of playback* synchronizing playback to an internal clock or to received MIDI
          messages* controlling the timing of another device

In addition, the following operations are supported, either directly, or
indirectly through objects that the `Sequencer` has access to:

* editing the data by adding or deleting individual MIDI events or entire
  tracks* muting or soloing individual tracks in the sequence* notifying listener objects about any meta-events or control-change
      events encountered while playing back the sequence

    void setSequence([Sequence](Sequence.md "class in javax.sound.midi") sequence)
    throws [InvalidMidiDataException](InvalidMidiDataException.md "class in javax.sound.midi")

    Sets the current sequence on which the sequencer operates.

    This method can be called even if the `Sequencer` is closed.

    Parameters:
    :   `sequence` - the sequence to be loaded

    Throws:
    :   `InvalidMidiDataException` - if the sequence contains invalid MIDI
        data, or is not supported
  + ### setSequence

    void setSequence([InputStream](../../../../java.base/java/io/InputStream.md "class in java.io") stream)
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io"),
    [InvalidMidiDataException](InvalidMidiDataException.md "class in javax.sound.midi")

    Sets the current sequence on which the sequencer operates. The stream
    must point to MIDI file data.

    This method can be called even if the `Sequencer` is closed.

    Parameters:
    :   `stream` - stream containing MIDI file data

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O exception occurs during reading of the
        stream
    :   `InvalidMidiDataException` - if invalid data is encountered in the
        stream, or the stream is not supported
  + ### getSequence

    [Sequence](Sequence.md "class in javax.sound.midi") getSequence()

    Obtains the sequence on which the Sequencer is currently operating.

    This method can be called even if the `Sequencer` is closed.

    Returns:
    :   the current sequence, or `null` if no sequence is currently
        set
  + ### start

    void start()

    Starts playback of the MIDI data in the currently loaded sequence.
    Playback will begin from the current position. If the playback position
    reaches the loop end point, and the loop count is greater than 0,
    playback will resume at the loop start point for the number of
    repetitions set with `setLoopCount`. After that, or if the loop
    count is 0, playback will continue to play to the end of the sequence.

    The implementation ensures that the synthesizer is brought to a
    consistent state when jumping to the loop start point by sending
    appropriate controllers, pitch bend, and program change events.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the `Sequencer` is closed

    See Also:
    :   - [`setLoopStartPoint(long)`](#setLoopStartPoint(long))
        - [`setLoopEndPoint(long)`](#setLoopEndPoint(long))

  + ### stop

    void stop()

    Stops recording, if active, and playback of the currently loaded
    sequence, if any.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the `Sequencer` is closed

    See Also:
    :   - [`start()`](#start())
        - [`isRunning()`](#isRunning())
  + ### isRunning

    boolean isRunning()

    Indicates whether the Sequencer is currently running. The default is
    `false`. The Sequencer starts running when either[`start()`](#start()) or
    [`startRecording()`](#startRecording()) is called. `isRunning` then returns
    `true` until playback of the sequence completes or [`stop()`](#stop()) is
    called.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the Sequencer is running, otherwise `false`
  + ### startRecording

    void startRecording()

    Starts recording and playback of MIDI data. Data is recorded to all
    enabled tracks, on the channel(s) for which they were enabled. Recording
    begins at the current position of the sequencer. Any events already in
    the track are overwritten for the duration of the recording session.
    Events from the currently loaded sequence, if any, are delivered to the
    sequencer's transmitter(s) along with messages received during recording.

    Note that tracks are not by default enabled for recording. In order to
    record MIDI data, at least one track must be specifically enabled for
    recording.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the `Sequencer` is closed

    See Also:
    :   - [`recordEnable(javax.sound.midi.Track, int)`](#recordEnable(javax.sound.midi.Track,int))
        - [`recordDisable(javax.sound.midi.Track)`](#recordDisable(javax.sound.midi.Track))
  + ### stopRecording

    Stops recording, if active. Playback of the current sequence continues.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the `Sequencer` is closed

    See Also:
    :   - [`startRecording()`](#startRecording())
        - [`isRecording()`](#isRecording())
  + ### isRecording

    boolean isRecording()

    Indicates whether the Sequencer is currently recording. The default is
    `false`. The Sequencer begins recording when
    [`startRecording()`](#startRecording()) is called, and then returns `true` until
    [`stop()`](#stop()) or [`stopRecording()`](#stopRecording()) is called.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the Sequencer is recording, otherwise
        `false`
  + ### recordEnable

    void recordEnable([Track](Track.md "class in javax.sound.midi") track,
    int channel)

    Prepares the specified track for recording events received on a
    particular channel. Once enabled, a track will receive events when
    recording is active.

    Parameters:
    :   `track` - the track to which events will be recorded
    :   `channel` - the channel on which events will be received. If -1 is
        specified for the channel value, the track will receive data from
        all channels.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - thrown if the track is not part of the
        current sequence
  + ### recordDisable

    void recordDisable([Track](Track.md "class in javax.sound.midi") track)

    Disables recording to the specified track. Events will no longer be
    recorded into this track.

        - [`getTempoInMPQ()`](#getTempoInMPQ())
  + ### setTempoFactor

    void setTempoFactor(float factor)

    Scales the sequencer's actual playback tempo by the factor provided. The
    default is 1.0. A value of 1.0 represents the natural rate (the tempo
    specified in the sequence), 2.0 means twice as fast, etc. The tempo
    factor does not affect the values returned by [`getTempoInMPQ()`](#getTempoInMPQ()) and
    [`getTempoInBPM()`](#getTempoInBPM()). Those values indicate the tempo prior to scaling.

    Note that the tempo factor cannot be adjusted when external
    synchronization is used. In that situation, `setTempoFactor` always
    sets the tempo factor to 1.0.

  + ### setTrackMute

    void setTrackMute(int track,
    boolean mute)

    Sets the mute state for a track. This method may fail for a number of
    reasons. For example, the track number specified may not be valid for the
    current sequence, or the sequencer may not support this functionality. An
    application which needs to verify whether this operation succeeded should
    follow this call with a call to [`getTrackMute(int)`](#getTrackMute(int)).

    Parameters:
    :   `track` - the track number. Tracks in the current sequence are
        numbered from 0 to the number of tracks in the sequence minus 1.
    :   `mute` - the new mute state for the track. `true` implies the
        track should be muted, `false` implies the track should be
        unmuted.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getSequence()`](#getSequence())
  + ### getTrackMute

    boolean getTrackMute(int track)

    Obtains the current mute state for a track. The default mute state for
    all tracks which have not been muted is false. In any case where the
    specified track has not been muted, this method should return false. This
    applies if the sequencer does not support muting of tracks, and if the
    specified track index is not valid.

    Parameters:
    :   `track` - the track number. Tracks in the current sequence are
        numbered from 0 to the number of tracks in the sequence minus 1.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if muted, `false` if not
  + ### setTrackSolo

    void setTrackSolo(int track,
    boolean solo)

    Sets the solo state for a track. If `solo` is `true` only
    this track and other solo'd tracks will sound. If `solo` is
    `false` then only other solo'd tracks will sound, unless no tracks
    are solo'd in which case all un-muted tracks will sound.

    This method may fail for a number of reasons. For example, the track
    number specified may not be valid for the current sequence, or the
    sequencer may not support this functionality. An application which needs
    to verify whether this operation succeeded should follow this call with a
    call to [`getTrackSolo(int)`](#getTrackSolo(int)).

    Parameters:
    :   `track` - the track number. Tracks in the current sequence are
        numbered from 0 to the number of tracks in the sequence minus 1.
    :   `solo` - the new solo state for the track. `true` implies the
        track should be solo'd, `false` implies the track should
        not be solo'd.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getSequence()`](#getSequence())
  + ### getTrackSolo

    boolean getTrackSolo(int track)

    Obtains the current solo state for a track. The default mute state for
    all tracks which have not been solo'd is false. In any case where the
    specified track has not been solo'd, this method should return false.
    This applies if the sequencer does not support soloing of tracks, and if
    the specified track index is not valid.

    Parameters:
    :   `track` - the track number. Tracks in the current sequence are
        numbered from 0 to the number of tracks in the sequence minus 1.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if solo'd, `false` if not
  + ### addMetaEventListener

    boolean addMetaEventListener([MetaEventListener](MetaEventListener.md "interface in javax.sound.midi") listener)

    Registers a meta-event listener to receive notification whenever a
    meta-event is encountered in the sequence and processed by the sequencer.
    This method can fail if, for instance, this class of sequencer does not
    support meta-event notification.

    Parameters:
    :   `listener` - listener to add

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the listener was successfully added, otherwise
        `false`

  + ### removeMetaEventListener

    void removeMetaEventListener([MetaEventListener](MetaEventListener.md "interface in javax.sound.midi") listener)

    Removes the specified meta-event listener from this sequencer's list of
    registered listeners, if in fact the listener is registered.

    Parameters:
    :   `listener` - the meta-event listener to remove

  + ### addControllerEventListener

    int[] addControllerEventListener([ControllerEventListener](ControllerEventListener.md "interface in javax.sound.midi") listener,
    int[] controllers)

    Registers a controller event listener to receive notification whenever
    the sequencer processes a control-change event of the requested type or
    types. The types are specified by the `controllers` argument, which
    should contain an array of MIDI controller numbers. (Each number should
    be between 0 and 127, inclusive. See the MIDI 1.0 Specification for the
    numbers that correspond to various types of controllers.)

    The returned array contains the MIDI controller numbers for which the
    listener will now receive events. Some sequencers might not support
    controller event notification, in which case the array has a length of 0.
    Other sequencers might support notification for some controllers but not
    all. This method may be invoked repeatedly. Each time, the returned array
    indicates all the controllers that the listener will be notified about,
    not only the controllers requested in that particular invocation.

    Parameters:
    :   `listener` - the controller event listener to add to the list of
        registered listeners
    :   `controllers` - the MIDI controller numbers for which change
        notification is requested

    Returns:
    :   the numbers of all the MIDI controllers whose changes will now be
        reported to the specified listener

  + ### removeControllerEventListener

    int[] removeControllerEventListener([ControllerEventListener](ControllerEventListener.md "interface in javax.sound.midi") listener,
    int[] controllers)

    Removes a controller event listener's interest in one or more types of
    controller event. The `controllers` argument is an array of MIDI
    numbers corresponding to the controllers for which the listener should no
    longer receive change notifications. To completely remove this listener
    from the list of registered listeners, pass in `null` for
    `controllers`. The returned array contains the MIDI controller
    numbers for which the listener will now receive events. The array has a
    length of 0 if the listener will not receive change notifications for any
    controllers.

    Parameters:
    :   `listener` - old listener
    :   `controllers` - the MIDI controller numbers for which change
        notification should be cancelled, or `null` to cancel for
        all controllers

    Returns:
    :   the numbers of all the MIDI controllers whose changes will now be
        reported to the specified listener

  + ### setLoopStartPoint

    void setLoopStartPoint(long tick)

    Sets the first MIDI tick that will be played in the loop. If the loop
    count is greater than 0, playback will jump to this point when reaching
    the loop end point.

    A value of 0 for the starting point means the beginning of the loaded
    sequence. The starting point must be lower than or equal to the ending
    point, and it must fall within the size of the loaded sequence.

    A sequencer's loop start point defaults to start of the sequence.

    Parameters:
    :   `tick` - the loop's starting position, in MIDI ticks (zero-based)

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the requested loop start point cannot
        be set, usually because it falls outside the sequence's duration
        or because the start point is after the end point

    Since:
    :   1.5

  + ### getLoopStartPoint

    long getLoopStartPoint()

    Obtains the start position of the loop, in MIDI ticks.

    Returns:
    :   the start position of the loop, in MIDI ticks (zero-based)

    Since:
    :   1.5

    See Also:
    :   - [`setLoopStartPoint(long)`](#setLoopStartPoint(long))
  + ### setLoopEndPoint

    void setLoopEndPoint(long tick)

    Sets the last MIDI tick that will be played in the loop. If the loop
    count is 0, the loop end point has no effect and playback continues to
    play when reaching the loop end point.

    A value of -1 for the ending point indicates the last tick of the
    sequence. Otherwise, the ending point must be greater than or equal to
    the starting point, and it must fall within the size of the loaded
    sequence.

    A sequencer's loop end point defaults to -1, meaning the end of the
    sequence.

    Parameters:
    :   `tick` - the loop's ending position, in MIDI ticks (zero-based), or
        -1 to indicate the final tick

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the requested loop point cannot be
        set, usually because it falls outside the sequence's duration or
        because the ending point is before the starting point

  + ### getLoopEndPoint

    long getLoopEndPoint()

    Obtains the end position of the loop, in MIDI ticks.

    Returns:
    :   the end position of the loop, in MIDI ticks (zero-based), or -1
        to indicate the end of the sequence

    Since:
    :   1.5

    See Also:
    :   - [`setLoopEndPoint(long)`](#setLoopEndPoint(long))
  + ### setLoopCount

    void setLoopCount(int count)

    Sets the number of repetitions of the loop for playback. When the
    playback position reaches the loop end point, it will loop back to the
    loop start point `count` times, after which playback will continue
    to play to the end of the sequence.

    If the current position when this method is invoked is greater than the
    loop end point, playback continues to the end of the sequence without
    looping, unless the loop end point is changed subsequently.

    A `count` value of 0 disables looping: playback will continue at
    the loop end point, and it will not loop back to the loop start point.
    This is a sequencer's default.

    If playback is stopped during looping, the current loop status is
    cleared; subsequent start requests are not affected by an interrupted
    loop operation.

    Parameters:
    :   `count` - the number of times playback should loop back from the
        loop's end position to the loop's start position, or
        [`LOOP_CONTINUOUSLY`](#LOOP_CONTINUOUSLY) to indicate that looping should
        continue until interrupted

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `count` is negative and not
        equal to [`LOOP_CONTINUOUSLY`](#LOOP_CONTINUOUSLY)

  + ### getLoopCount

    int getLoopCount()

    Obtains the number of repetitions for playback.

    Returns:
