public class ServiceRegistry
extends [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

A registry for service provider instances for Image I/O service types.

Service providers are stored in one or more *categories*,
each of which is defined by a class or interface (described by a
`Class` object) that all of its members must implement.

The set of categories supported by this class is limited
to the following standard Image I/O service types:

* [`ImageInputStreamSpi`](ImageInputStreamSpi.md "class in javax.imageio.spi")* [`ImageOutputStreamSpi`](ImageOutputStreamSpi.md "class in javax.imageio.spi")* [`ImageReaderSpi`](ImageReaderSpi.md "class in javax.imageio.spi")* [`ImageTranscoderSpi`](ImageTranscoderSpi.md "class in javax.imageio.spi")* [`ImageWriterSpi`](ImageWriterSpi.md "class in javax.imageio.spi")

An attempt to load a provider that is not a subtype of one of the
above types will result in `IllegalArgumentException`.

For the general mechanism to load service providers, see
[`ServiceLoader`](../../../../java.base/java/util/ServiceLoader.md "class in java.util"), which is
the underlying standard mechanism used by this class.

Only a single instance of a given leaf class (that is, the
actual class returned by `getClass()`, as opposed to any
inherited classes or interfaces) may be registered. That is,
suppose that the
`com.mycompany.mypkg.GreenImageReaderProvider` class
is a subclass of `javax.imageio.spi.ImageReaderSpi`.
If a `GreenImageReaderProvider` instance is
registered, it will be stored in the category defined by the
`ImageReaderSpi` class. If a new instance of
`GreenImageReaderProvider` is registered, it will replace
the previous instance. In practice, service provider objects are
usually singletons so this behavior is appropriate.

The service provider classes should be lightweight and
quick to load. Implementations of these interfaces should avoid
complex dependencies on other classes and on native code. The usual
pattern for more complex services is to register a lightweight
proxy for the heavyweight service.

An application may customize the contents of a registry as it
sees fit, so long as it has the appropriate runtime permission.

For information on how to create and deploy service providers,
refer to the documentation on [`ServiceLoader`](../../../../java.base/java/util/ServiceLoader.md "class in java.util")

    public ServiceRegistry([Iterator](../../../../java.base/java/util/Iterator.md "interface in java.util")<[Class](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<?>> categories)

    Constructs a `ServiceRegistry` instance with a
    set of categories taken from the `categories`
    argument. The categories must all be members of the set
    of service types listed in the class specification.

    Parameters:
    :   `categories` - an `Iterator` containing
        `Class` objects to be used to define categories.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if
        `categories` is `null`, or if
        one of the categories is not an allowed service type.
* ## Method Details

  + ### lookupProviders

    public static <T> [Iterator](../../../../java.base/java/util/Iterator.md "interface in java.util")<T> lookupProviders([Class](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> providerClass,
    [ClassLoader](../../../../java.base/java/lang/ClassLoader.md "class in java.lang") loader)

    Searches for implementations of a particular service class
    using the given class loader.

    The service class must be one of the service types listed
    in the class specification. If it is not, `IllegalArgumentException`
    will be thrown.

    This method transforms the name of the given service class
    into a provider-configuration filename as described in the
    class comment and then uses the `getResources`
    method of the given class loader to find all available files
    with that name. These files are then read and parsed to
    produce a list of provider-class names. The iterator that is
    returned uses the given class loader to look up and then
    instantiate each element of the list.

    Because it is possible for extensions to be installed into
    a running Java virtual machine, this method may return
    different results each time it is invoked.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the providerClass.

    Parameters:
    :   `providerClass` - a `Class` object indicating the
        class or interface of the service providers being detected.
    :   `loader` - the class loader to be used to load
        provider-configuration files and instantiate provider classes,
        or `null` if the system class loader (or, failing that
        the bootstrap class loader) is to be used.

    Returns:
    :   An `Iterator` that yields provider objects
        for the given service, in some arbitrary order. The iterator
        will throw an `Error` if a provider-configuration
        file violates the specified format or if a provider class
        cannot be found and instantiated.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if
        `providerClass` is `null`, or if it is
        not one of the allowed service types.
  + ### lookupProviders

    public static <T> [Iterator](../../../../java.base/java/util/Iterator.md "interface in java.util")<T> lookupProviders([Class](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> providerClass)

    Locates and incrementally instantiates the available providers
    of a given service using the context class loader. This
    convenience method is equivalent to:

    ```
       ClassLoader cl = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
       return Service.providers(service, cl);
    ```

    The service class must be one of the service types listed
    in the class specification. If it is not, `IllegalArgumentException`
    will be thrown.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the providerClass.

    Parameters:
    :   `providerClass` - a `Class` object indicating the
        class or interface of the service providers being detected.

    Returns:
    :   An `Iterator` that yields provider objects
        for the given service, in some arbitrary order. The iterator
        will throw an `Error` if a provider-configuration
        file violates the specified format or if a provider class
        cannot be found and instantiated.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if
        `providerClass` is `null`, or if it is
        not one of the allowed service types.
  + ### getCategories

    public [Iterator](../../../../java.base/java/util/Iterator.md "interface in java.util")<[Class](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<?>> getCategories()

    Returns an `Iterator` of `Class` objects
    indicating the current set of categories. The iterator will be
    empty if no categories exist.

    Returns:
    :   an `Iterator` containing
        `Class` objects.
  + ### registerServiceProvider

    public <T> boolean registerServiceProvider(T provider,
    [Class](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> category)

    Adds a service provider object to the registry. The provider
    is associated with the given category.

    If `provider` implements the
    `RegisterableService` interface, its
    `onRegistration` method will be called. Its
    `onDeregistration` method will be called each time
    it is deregistered from a category, for example if a
    category is removed or the registry is garbage collected.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the provider.

    Parameters:
    :   `provider` - the service provide object to be registered.
    :   `category` - the category under which to register the
        provider.

    Returns:
    :   true if no provider of the same class was previously
        registered in the same category category.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `provider` is
        `null`.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if there is no category
        corresponding to `category`.
    :   `ClassCastException` - if provider does not implement
        the `Class` defined by `category`.
  + ### registerServiceProvider

    public void registerServiceProvider([Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") provider)

    Adds a service provider object to the registry. The provider
    is associated within each category present in the registry
    whose `Class` it implements.

    If `provider` implements the
    `RegisterableService` interface, its
    `onRegistration` method will be called once for each
    category it is registered under. Its
    `onDeregistration` method will be called each time
    it is deregistered from a category or when the registry is
    finalized.

    Parameters:
    :   `provider` - the service provider object to be registered.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if
        `provider` is `null`.
  + ### registerServiceProviders

    public void registerServiceProviders([Iterator](../../../../java.base/java/util/Iterator.md "interface in java.util")<?> providers)

    Adds a set of service provider objects, taken from an
    `Iterator` to the registry. Each provider is
    associated within each category present in the registry whose
    `Class` it implements.

    For each entry of `providers` that implements
    the `RegisterableService` interface, its
    `onRegistration` method will be called once for each
    category it is registered under. Its
    `onDeregistration` method will be called each time
    it is deregistered from a category or when the registry is
    finalized.

    Parameters:
    :   `providers` - an Iterator containing service provider
        objects to be registered.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `providers`
        is `null` or contains a `null` entry.
  + ### deregisterServiceProvider

    public <T> boolean deregisterServiceProvider(T provider,
    [Class](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> category)

    Removes a service provider object from the given category. If
    the provider was not previously registered, nothing happens and
    `false` is returned. Otherwise, `true`
    is returned. If an object of the same class as
    `provider` but not equal (using `==`) to
    `provider` is registered, it will not be
    deregistered.

    If `provider` implements the
    `RegisterableService` interface, its
    `onDeregistration` method will be called.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the provider.

    Parameters:
    :   `provider` - the service provider object to be deregistered.
    :   `category` - the category from which to deregister the
        provider.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the provider was previously
        registered in the same category category,
        `false` otherwise.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `provider` is
        `null`.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if there is no category
        corresponding to `category`.
    :   `ClassCastException` - if provider does not implement
        the class defined by `category`.
  + ### deregisterServiceProvider

    public void deregisterServiceProvider([Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") provider)

    Removes a service provider object from all categories that
    contain it.

    Parameters:
    :   `provider` - the service provider object to be deregistered.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `provider` is
        `null`.
  + ### contains

    public boolean contains([Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") provider)

    Returns `true` if `provider` is currently
    registered.

    Parameters:
    :   `provider` - the service provider object to be queried.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the given provider has been
        registered.

    Throws:

  + ### getServiceProviders

    public <T> [Iterator](../../../../java.base/java/util/Iterator.md "interface in java.util")<T> getServiceProviders([Class](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> category,
    boolean useOrdering)

    Returns an `Iterator` containing all registered
    service providers in the given category. If
    `useOrdering` is `false`, the iterator
    will return all of the server provider objects in an arbitrary
    order. Otherwise, the ordering will respect any pairwise
    orderings that have been set. If the graph of pairwise
    orderings contains cycles, any providers that belong to a cycle
    will not be returned.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the category.

    Parameters:
    :   `category` - the category to be retrieved from.
    :   `useOrdering` - `true` if pairwise orderings
        should be taken account in ordering the returned objects.

    Returns:
    :   an `Iterator` containing service provider
        objects from the given category, possibly in order.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if there is no category
        corresponding to `category`.
  + ### getServiceProviders

    public <T> [Iterator](../../../../java.base/java/util/Iterator.md "interface in java.util")<T> getServiceProviders([Class](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> category,
    [ServiceRegistry.Filter](ServiceRegistry.Filter.md "interface in javax.imageio.spi") filter,
    boolean useOrdering)

    Returns an `Iterator` containing service provider
    objects within a given category that satisfy a criterion
    imposed by the supplied `ServiceRegistry.Filter`
    object's `filter` method.

    The `useOrdering` argument controls the
    ordering of the results using the same rules as
    `getServiceProviders(Class, boolean)`.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the category.

    Parameters:
    :   `category` - the category to be retrieved from.
    :   `filter` - an instance of `ServiceRegistry.Filter`
        whose `filter` method will be invoked.
    :   `useOrdering` - `true` if pairwise orderings
        should be taken account in ordering the returned objects.

    Returns:
    :   an `Iterator` containing service provider
        objects from the given category, possibly in order.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if there is no category
        corresponding to `category`.
  + ### getServiceProviderByClass

    public <T> T getServiceProviderByClass([Class](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> providerClass)

    Returns the currently registered service provider object that
    is of the given class type. At most one object of a given
    class is allowed to be registered at any given time. If no
    registered object has the desired class type, `null`
    is returned.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the provider.

    Parameters:
    :   `providerClass` - the `Class` of the desired
        service provider object.

    Returns:
    :   a currently registered service provider object with the
        desired `Class` type, or `null` is none is
        present.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `providerClass` is
        `null`.
  + ### setOrdering

    public <T> boolean setOrdering([Class](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> category,
    T firstProvider,
    T secondProvider)

    Sets a pairwise ordering between two service provider objects
    within a given category. If one or both objects are not
    currently registered within the given category, or if the
    desired ordering is already set, nothing happens and
    `false` is returned. If the providers previously
    were ordered in the reverse direction, that ordering is
    removed.

    The ordering will be used by the
    `getServiceProviders` methods when their
    `useOrdering` argument is `true`.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the category.

    Parameters:
    :   `category` - a `Class` object indicating the
        category under which the preference is to be established.
    :   `firstProvider` - the preferred provider.
    :   `secondProvider` - the provider to which
        `firstProvider` is preferred.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if a previously unset ordering
        was established.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if either provider is
        `null` or they are the same object.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if there is no category
        corresponding to `category`.
  + ### unsetOrdering

    public <T> boolean unsetOrdering([Class](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> category,
    T firstProvider,
    T secondProvider)

    Sets a pairwise ordering between two service provider objects
    within a given category. If one or both objects are not
    currently registered within the given category, or if no
    ordering is currently set between them, nothing happens
    and `false` is returned.

    The ordering will be used by the
    `getServiceProviders` methods when their
    `useOrdering` argument is `true`.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the category.

    Parameters:
    :   `category` - a `Class` object indicating the
        category under which the preference is to be disestablished.

    :   `secondProvider` - the provider to which
        `firstProvider` was formerly preferred.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if a previously set ordering was
        disestablished.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if either provider is
        `null` or they are the same object.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if there is no category
        corresponding to `category`.
