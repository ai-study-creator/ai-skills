# Class IIOParam

[java.lang.Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

javax.imageio.IIOParam

Direct Known Subclasses:
:   `ImageReadParam`, `ImageWriteParam`

---

public abstract class IIOParam
extends [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

A superclass of all classes describing how streams should be
decoded or encoded. This class contains all the variables and
methods that are shared by `ImageReadParam` and
`ImageWriteParam`.

This class provides mechanisms to specify a source region and a
destination region. When reading, the source is the stream and
the in-memory image is the destination. When writing, these are
reversed. In the case of writing, destination regions may be used
only with a writer that supports pixel replacement.

Decimation subsampling may be specified for both readers
and writers, using a movable subsampling grid.

Subsets of the source and destination bands may be selected.

  + ### IIOParam

    protected IIOParam()

    Protected constructor may be called only by subclasses.
* ## Method Details

  + ### setSourceRegion

    public void setSourceRegion([Rectangle](../../java/awt/Rectangle.md "class in java.awt") sourceRegion)

    Sets the source region of interest. The region of interest is
    described as a rectangle, with the upper-left corner of the
    source image as pixel (0, 0) and increasing values down and to
    the right. The actual number of pixels used will depend on
    the subsampling factors set by `setSourceSubsampling`.
    If subsampling has been set such that this number is zero,
    an `IllegalStateException` will be thrown.

    The source region of interest specified by this method will
    be clipped as needed to fit within the source bounds, as well
    as the destination offsets, width, and height at the time of
    actual I/O.

    A value of `null` for `sourceRegion`
    will remove any region specification, causing the entire image
    to be used.

    Parameters:
    :   `sourceRegion` - a `Rectangle` specifying the
        source region of interest, or `null`.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if
        `sourceRegion` is non-`null` and either
        `sourceRegion.x` or `sourceRegion.y` is
        negative.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if
        `sourceRegion` is non-`null` and either
        `sourceRegion.width` or
        `sourceRegion.height` is negative or 0.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if subsampling is such that
        this region will have a subsampled width or height of zero.

        - [`getDestinationOffset()`](#getDestinationOffset())
  + ### getSourceRegion

    public [Rectangle](../../java/awt/Rectangle.md "class in java.awt") getSourceRegion()

    Returns the source region to be used. The returned value is
    that set by the most recent call to
    `setSourceRegion`, and will be `null` if
    there is no region set.

    Returns:
    :   the source region of interest as a
        `Rectangle`, or `null`.

    See Also:
    :   - [`setSourceRegion(java.awt.Rectangle)`](#setSourceRegion(java.awt.Rectangle))
  + ### setSourceSubsampling

    public void setSourceSubsampling(int sourceXSubsampling,
    int sourceYSubsampling,
    int subsamplingXOffset,
    int subsamplingYOffset)

    Specifies a decimation subsampling to apply on I/O. The
    `sourceXSubsampling` and
    `sourceYSubsampling` parameters specify the
    subsampling period (*i.e.*, the number of rows and columns
    to advance after every source pixel). Specifically, a period of
    1 will use every row or column; a period of 2 will use every
    other row or column. The `subsamplingXOffset` and
    `subsamplingYOffset` parameters specify an offset
    from the region (or image) origin for the first subsampled pixel.
    Adjusting the origin of the subsample grid is useful for avoiding
    seams when subsampling a very large source image into destination
    regions that will be assembled into a complete subsampled image.
    Most users will want to simply leave these parameters at 0.

    The number of pixels and scanlines to be used are calculated
    as follows.

    The number of subsampled pixels in a scanline is given by

    `truncate[(width - subsamplingXOffset + sourceXSubsampling - 1)
    / sourceXSubsampling]`.

    If the region is such that this width is zero, an
    `IllegalStateException` is thrown.

    The number of scanlines to be used can be computed similarly.

    The ability to set the subsampling grid to start somewhere
    other than the source region origin is useful if the
    region is being used to create subsampled tiles of a large image,
    where the tile width and height are not multiples of the
    subsampling periods. If the subsampling grid does not remain
    consistent from tile to tile, there will be artifacts at the tile
    boundaries. By adjusting the subsampling grid offset for each
    tile to compensate, these artifacts can be avoided. The tradeoff
    is that in order to avoid these artifacts, the tiles are not all
    the same size. The grid offset to use in this case is given by:
      
    grid offset = [period - (region offset modulo period)] modulo period)

    If either `sourceXSubsampling` or
    `sourceYSubsampling` is 0 or negative, an
    `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown.

    If either `subsamplingXOffset` or
    `subsamplingYOffset` is negative or greater than or
    equal to the corresponding period, an
    `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown.

    There is no `unsetSourceSubsampling` method;
    simply call `setSourceSubsampling(1, 1, 0, 0)` to
    restore default values.

    Parameters:
    :   `sourceXSubsampling` - the number of columns to advance
        between pixels.
    :   `sourceYSubsampling` - the number of rows to advance between
        pixels.
    :   `subsamplingXOffset` - the horizontal offset of the first subsample
        within the region, or within the image if no region is set.
    :   `subsamplingYOffset` - the horizontal offset of the first subsample
        within the region, or within the image if no region is set.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if either period is
        negative or 0, or if either grid offset is negative or greater than
        the corresponding period.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the source region is such that
        the subsampled output would contain no pixels.

  + ### getSourceYSubsampling

    public int getSourceYSubsampling()

    Returns the number of rows to advance for each pixel.

    If `setSourceSubsampling` has not been called, 1
    is returned (which is the correct value).

  + ### getSubsamplingXOffset

    public int getSubsamplingXOffset()

    Returns the horizontal offset of the subsampling grid.

    If `setSourceSubsampling` has not been called, 0
    is returned (which is the correct value).

    Returns:
    :   the source subsampling grid X offset.

  + ### getSubsamplingYOffset

    public int getSubsamplingYOffset()

    Returns the vertical offset of the subsampling grid.

    If `setSourceSubsampling` has not been called, 0
    is returned (which is the correct value).

    Returns:
    :   the source subsampling grid Y offset.

    See Also:
    :   - [`setSourceSubsampling(int, int, int, int)`](#setSourceSubsampling(int,int,int,int))
        - [`getSubsamplingXOffset()`](#getSubsamplingXOffset())
  + ### setSourceBands

    public void setSourceBands(int[] sourceBands)

    Sets the indices of the source bands to be used. Duplicate
    indices are not allowed.

    A `null` value indicates that all source bands
    will be used.

    At the time of reading, an
    `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown by the
    reader or writer if a value larger than the largest available
    source band index has been specified or if the number of source
    bands and destination bands to be used differ. The
    `ImageReader.checkReadParamBandSettings` method may
    be used to automate this test.

    Semantically, a copy is made of the array; changes to the
    array contents subsequent to this call have no effect on
    this `IIOParam`.

    Parameters:
    :   `sourceBands` - an array of integer band indices to be
        used.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `sourceBands`
        contains a negative or duplicate value.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getSourceBands()`](#getSourceBands())
        - [`ImageReadParam.setDestinationBands(int[])`](ImageReadParam.md#setDestinationBands(int%5B%5D))
        - [`ImageReader.checkReadParamBandSettings(javax.imageio.ImageReadParam, int, int)`](ImageReader.md#checkReadParamBandSettings(javax.imageio.ImageReadParam,int,int))
  + ### getSourceBands

    public int[] getSourceBands()

    Returns the set of source bands to be used. The returned
    value is that set by the most recent call to
    `setSourceBands`, or `null` if there have
    been no calls to `setSourceBands`.

    Semantically, the array returned is a copy; changes to
    array contents subsequent to this call have no effect on this
    `IIOParam`.

    Returns:
    :   the set of source bands to be used, or
        `null`.

    See Also:
    :   - [`setSourceBands(int[])`](#setSourceBands(int%5B%5D))
  + ### setDestinationType

    public void setDestinationType([ImageTypeSpecifier](ImageTypeSpecifier.md "class in javax.imageio") destinationType)

    Sets the desired image type for the destination image, using an
    `ImageTypeSpecifier`.

    When reading, if the layout of the destination has been set
    using this method, each call to an `ImageReader`
    `read` method will return a new
    `BufferedImage` using the format specified by the
    supplied type specifier. As a side effect, any destination
    `BufferedImage` set by
    `ImageReadParam.setDestination(BufferedImage)` will
    no longer be set as the destination. In other words, this
    method may be thought of as calling
    `setDestination((BufferedImage)null)`.

    When writing, the destination type maybe used to determine
    the color type of the image. The `SampleModel`
    information will be ignored, and may be `null`. For
    example, a 4-banded image could represent either CMYK or RGBA
    data. If a destination type is set, its
    `ColorModel` will override any
    `ColorModel` on the image itself. This is crucial
    when `setSourceBands` is used since the image's
    `ColorModel` will refer to the entire image rather
    than to the subset of bands being written.

    Parameters:
    :   `destinationType` - the `ImageTypeSpecifier` to
        be used to determine the destination layout and color type.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getDestinationType()`](#getDestinationType())
  + ### getDestinationType

    public [ImageTypeSpecifier](ImageTypeSpecifier.md "class in javax.imageio") getDestinationType()

    Returns the type of image to be returned by the read, if one
    was set by a call to
    `setDestination(ImageTypeSpecifier)`, as an
    `ImageTypeSpecifier`. If none was set,
    `null` is returned.

    Returns:
    :   an `ImageTypeSpecifier` describing the
        destination type, or `null`.

    See Also:
    :   - [`setDestinationType(javax.imageio.ImageTypeSpecifier)`](#setDestinationType(javax.imageio.ImageTypeSpecifier))
  + ### setDestinationOffset

    public void setDestinationOffset([Point](../../java/awt/Point.md "class in java.awt") destinationOffset)

    Specifies the offset in the destination image at which future
    decoded pixels are to be placed, when reading, or where a
    region will be written, when writing.

    When reading, the region to be written within the
    destination `BufferedImage` will start at this
    offset and have a width and height determined by the source
    region of interest, the subsampling parameters, and the
    destination bounds.

    Normal writes are not affected by this method, only writes
    performed using `ImageWriter.replacePixels`. For
    such writes, the offset specified is within the output stream
    image whose pixels are being modified.

    There is no `unsetDestinationOffset` method;
    simply call `setDestinationOffset(new Point(0, 0))` to
    restore default values.

    Parameters:
    :   `destinationOffset` - the offset in the destination, as a
        `Point`.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if
        `destinationOffset` is `null`.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getDestinationOffset()`](#getDestinationOffset())
        - [`ImageWriter.replacePixels(java.awt.image.RenderedImage, javax.imageio.ImageWriteParam)`](ImageWriter.md#replacePixels(java.awt.image.RenderedImage,javax.imageio.ImageWriteParam))
  + ### getDestinationOffset

    public [Point](../../java/awt/Point.md "class in java.awt") getDestinationOffset()

    Returns the offset in the destination image at which pixels are
    to be placed.

    If `setDestinationOffsets` has not been called,
    a `Point` with zero X and Y values is returned
    (which is the correct value).

    Returns:
    :   the destination offset as a `Point`.

    See Also:
    :   - [`setDestinationOffset(java.awt.Point)`](#setDestinationOffset(java.awt.Point))
  + ### setController

    public void setController([IIOParamController](IIOParamController.md "interface in javax.imageio") controller)

    Sets the `IIOParamController` to be used
    to provide settings for this `IIOParam`
    object when the `activateController` method
    is called, overriding any default controller. If the
    argument is `null`, no controller will be
    used, including any default. To restore the default, use
    `setController(getDefaultController())`.

    Parameters:
    :   `controller` - An appropriate
        `IIOParamController`, or `null`.

        - [`activateController()`](#activateController())
  + ### getController

    public [IIOParamController](IIOParamController.md "interface in javax.imageio") getController()

    Returns whatever `IIOParamController` is currently
    installed. This could be the default if there is one,
    `null`, or the argument of the most recent call
    to `setController`.

    Returns:
    :   the currently installed
        `IIOParamController`, or `null`.

        - [`activateController()`](#activateController())
  + ### getDefaultController

    public [IIOParamController](IIOParamController.md "interface in javax.imageio") getDefaultController()

    Returns the default `IIOParamController`, if there
    is one, regardless of the currently installed controller. If
    there is no default controller, returns `null`.

    Returns:
    :   the default `IIOParamController`, or
        `null`.

        - [`activateController()`](#activateController())
  + ### hasController

    public boolean hasController()

    Returns `true` if there is a controller installed
    for this `IIOParam` object. This will return
    `true` if `getController` would not
    return `null`.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if a controller is installed.

        - [`getDefaultController()`](#getDefaultController())
        - [`activateController()`](#activateController())
  + ### activateController

    public boolean activateController()

    Activates the installed `IIOParamController` for
    this `IIOParam` object and returns the resulting
    value. When this method returns `true`, all values
    for this `IIOParam` object will be ready for the
    next read or write operation. If `false` is
    returned, no settings in this object will have been disturbed
    (*i.e.*, the user canceled the operation).

    Ordinarily, the controller will be a GUI providing a user
    interface for a subclass of `IIOParam` for a
    particular plug-in. Controllers need not be GUIs, however.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the controller completed normally.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if there is no controller
        currently installed.
