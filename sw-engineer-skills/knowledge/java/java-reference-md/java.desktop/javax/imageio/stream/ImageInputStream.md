public interface ImageInputStream
extends [DataInput](../../../../java.base/java/io/DataInput.md "interface in java.io"), [Closeable](../../../../java.base/java/io/Closeable.md "interface in java.io")

A seekable input stream interface for use by
`ImageReader`s. Various input sources, such as
`InputStream`s and `File`s,
as well as future fast I/O sources may be "wrapped" by a suitable
implementation of this interface for use by the Image I/O API.

* ## Method Details

  + ### setByteOrder

    void setByteOrder([ByteOrder](../../../../java.base/java/nio/ByteOrder.md "class in java.nio") byteOrder)

    Sets the desired byte order for future reads of data values
    from this stream. For example, the sequence of bytes '0x01
    0x02 0x03 0x04' if read as a 4-byte integer would have the
    value '0x01020304' using network byte order and the value
    '0x04030201' under the reverse byte order.

    The enumeration class `java.nio.ByteOrder` is
    used to specify the byte order. A value of
    `ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN` specifies so-called
    big-endian or network byte order, in which the high-order byte
    comes first. Motorola and Sparc processors store data in this
    format, while Intel processors store data in the reverse
    `ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN` order.

    The byte order has no effect on the results returned from
    the `readBits` method (or the value written by
    `ImageOutputStream.writeBits`).

    Parameters:
    :   `byteOrder` - one of `ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN` or
        `java.nio.ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN`, indicating whether
        network byte order or its reverse will be used for future
        reads.

    The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
    the read occurs.

    Parameters:
    :   `b` - an array of bytes to be written to.

        to indicate EOF.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `b` is
        `null`.
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if `off` is
        negative, `len` is negative, or `off + len`
        is greater than `b.length`.
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### readBytes

    void readBytes([IIOByteBuffer](IIOByteBuffer.md "class in javax.imageio.stream") buf,
    int len)
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads up to `len` bytes from the stream, and
    modifies the supplied `IIOByteBuffer` to indicate
    the byte array, offset, and length where the data may be found.
    The caller should not attempt to modify the data found in the
    `IIOByteBuffer`.

    The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before

    Parameters:
    :   `buf` - an IIOByteBuffer object to be modified.
    :   `len` - the maximum number of `byte`s to read.

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if `len` is
        negative.
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `buf` is
        `null`.
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### readBoolean

    boolean readBoolean()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads a byte from the stream and returns a `boolean`
    value of `true` if it is nonzero, `false`
    if it is zero.

    The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
    the read occurs.

    Specified by:
    :   `readBoolean` in interface `DataInput`

    Returns:
    :   a boolean value from the stream.

    Throws:
    :   `EOFException` - if the end of the stream is reached.
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### readByte

    byte readByte()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads a byte from the stream and returns it as a
    `byte` value. Byte values between `0x00`
    and `0x7f` represent integer values between
    `0` and `127`. Values between
    `0x80` and `0xff` represent negative
    values from `-128` to `/1`.

    The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
    the read occurs.

    Specified by:
    :   `readByte` in interface `DataInput`

    Returns:
    :   a signed byte value from the stream.

    Throws:
    :   `EOFException` - if the end of the stream is reached.

  + ### readUnsignedByte

    int readUnsignedByte()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads a byte from the stream, and (conceptually) converts it to
    an int, masks it with `0xff` in order to strip off
    any sign-extension bits, and returns it as a `byte`
    value.

    Thus, byte values between `0x00` and
    `0x7f` are simply returned as integer values between
    `0` and `127`. Values between
    `0x80` and `0xff`, which normally
    represent negative `byte` values, will be mapped into
    positive integers between `128` and
    `255`.

    The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
    the read occurs.

    Specified by:
    :   `readUnsignedByte` in interface `DataInput`

    Returns:
    :   an unsigned byte value from the stream.

    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads two bytes from the stream, and (conceptually)
    concatenates them according to the current byte order, and

    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads two bytes from the stream, and (conceptually)
    concatenates them according to the current byte order, converts
    the resulting value to an `int`, masks it with
    `0xffff` in order to strip off any sign-extension
    buts, and returns the result as an unsigned `int`
    value.

    The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
    the read occurs.

    Specified by:
    :   `readUnsignedShort` in interface `DataInput`

    as an `int`.

    The bit offset within the stream is ignored and treated as
    though it were zero.

    Specified by:
    :   `readInt` in interface `DataInput`

    Returns:
    :   a signed int value from the stream.

    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") readLine()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads the next line of text from the input stream. It reads
    successive bytes, converting each byte separately into a
    character, until it encounters a line terminator or end of
    file; the characters read are then returned as a
    `String`. Note that because this method processes
    bytes, it does not support input of the full Unicode character
    set.

    If end of file is encountered before even one byte can be
    read, then `null` is returned. Otherwise, each byte
    that is read is converted to type `char` by
    zero-extension. If the character `'\n'` is
    encountered, it is discarded and reading ceases. If the
    character `'\r'` is encountered, it is discarded
    and, if the following byte converts to the character
    `'\n'`, then that is discarded also; reading then
    ceases. If end of file is encountered before either of the
    characters `'\n'` and `'\r'` is
    encountered, reading ceases. Once reading has ceased, a
    `String` is returned that contains all the
    characters read and not discarded, taken in order. Note that
    every character in this string will have a value less than
    `\u0100`, that is, `(char)256`.

    The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
    the read occurs.

    Specified by:
    :   `readLine` in interface `DataInput`

    Returns:
    :   a String containing a line of text from the stream.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.

    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads in a string that has been encoded using a
    [modified UTF-8](../../../../java.base/java/io/DataInput.md#modified-utf-8)
    format. The general contract of `readUTF` is that
    it reads a representation of a Unicode character string encoded
    in modified UTF-8 format; this string of characters is
    then returned as a `String`.

    First, two bytes are read and used to construct an unsigned
    16-bit integer in the manner of the
    `readUnsignedShort` method, using network byte order
    (regardless of the current byte order setting). This integer
    value is called the *UTF length* and specifies the number
    of additional bytes to be read. These bytes are then converted
    to characters by considering them in groups. The length of each
    group is computed from the value of the first byte of the
    group. The byte following a group, if any, is the first byte of
    the next group.

    If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern
    `0xxxxxxx` (where `x` means "may be
    `0` or `1`"), then the group consists of
    just that byte. The byte is zero-extended to form a character.

    If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern
    `110xxxxx`, then the group consists of that byte
    `a` and a second byte `b`. If there is no
    byte `b` (because byte `a` was the last
    of the bytes to be read), or if byte `b` does not
    match the bit pattern `10xxxxxx`, then a
    `UTFDataFormatException` is thrown. Otherwise, the
    group is converted to the character:

    ```
     (char)(((a& 0x1F) << 6) | (b & 0x3F))
    ```

    If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern
    `1110xxxx`, then the group consists of that byte
    `a` and two more bytes `b` and
    `c`. If there is no byte `c` (because
    byte `a` was one of the last two of the bytes to be
    read), or either byte `b` or byte `c`
    does not match the bit pattern `10xxxxxx`, then a
    `UTFDataFormatException` is thrown. Otherwise, the
    group is converted to the character:

    ```
     (char)(((a & 0x0F) << 12) | ((b & 0x3F) << 6) | (c & 0x3F))
    ```

    If the first byte of a group matches the pattern
    `1111xxxx` or the pattern `10xxxxxx`,
    then a `UTFDataFormatException` is thrown.

    If end of file is encountered at any time during this
    entire process, then a `java.io.EOFException` is thrown.

    After every group has been converted to a character by this
    process, the characters are gathered, in the same order in
    which their corresponding groups were read from the input
    stream, to form a `String`, which is returned.

    The current byte order setting is ignored.

    The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
    the read occurs.

    **Note:** This method should not be used in
    the implementation of image formats that use standard UTF-8,
    because the modified UTF-8 used here is incompatible with
    standard UTF-8.

    :   `readUTF` in interface `DataInput`

    Returns:
    :   a String read from the stream.

    Throws:
    :   `EOFException` - if this stream reaches the end

    Reads `len` floats (32-bit IEEE single-precision
    floats) from the stream according to the current byte order,
    and stores them into `f` starting at
    index `off`. If the end of the stream is reached,
    a `java.io.EOFException` will be thrown.

    The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
    the read occurs.

    Parameters:
    :   `f` - an array of floats to be written to.
    :   `off` - the starting position within `f` to write to.
    :   `len` - the maximum number of `float`s to read.

    Reads `len` doubles (64-bit IEEE double-precision
    floats) from the stream according to the current byte order,
    and stores them into `d` starting at
    index `off`. If the end of the stream is reached,
    a `java.io.EOFException` will be thrown.

    The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
    the read occurs.

    Parameters:
    :   `d` - an array of doubles to be written to.
    :   `off` - the starting position within `d` to write to.
    :   `len` - the maximum number of `double`s to read.

    Throws:

    long getStreamPosition()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Returns the current byte position of the stream. The next read
    will take place starting at this offset.

    Returns:
    :   a long containing the position of the stream.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### getBitOffset

    int getBitOffset()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Returns the current bit offset, as an integer between 0 and 7,
    inclusive. The bit offset is updated implicitly by calls to
    the `readBits` method. A value of 0 indicates the
    most-significant bit, and a value of 7 indicates the least
    significant bit, of the byte being read.

    The bit offset is set to 0 when a stream is first
    opened, and is reset to 0 by calls to `seek`,
    `skipBytes`, or any `read` or
    `readFully` method.

    Returns:
    :   an `int` containing the bit offset between
        0 and 7, inclusive.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.

    See Also:
    :   - [`setBitOffset(int)`](#setBitOffset(int))
  + ### setBitOffset

    void setBitOffset(int bitOffset)
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Sets the bit offset to an integer between 0 and 7, inclusive.
    The byte offset within the stream, as returned by
    `getStreamPosition`, is left unchanged.
    A value of 0 indicates the
    most-significant bit, and a value of 7 indicates the least
    significant bit, of the byte being read.

    Parameters:
    :   `bitOffset` - the desired offset, as an `int`
        between 0 and 7, inclusive.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `bitOffset`
        is not between 0 and 7, inclusive.
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getBitOffset()`](#getBitOffset())
  + ### readBit

    int readBit()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads a single bit from the stream and returns it as an
    `int` with the value `0` or
    `1`. The bit offset is advanced by one and reduced
    modulo 8.

    Returns:
    :   an `int` containing the value `0`
        or `1`.

    Throws:
    :   `EOFException` - if the stream reaches the end before
        reading all the bits.
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### readBits

    long readBits(int numBits)
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads a bitstring from the stream and returns it as a
    `long`, with the first bit read becoming the most
    significant bit of the output. The read starts within the byte
    indicated by `getStreamPosition`, at the bit given
    by `getBitOffset`. The bit offset is advanced by
    `numBits` and reduced modulo 8.

    The byte order of the stream has no effect on this
    method. The return value of this method is constructed as
    though the bits were read one at a time, and shifted into
    the right side of the return value, as shown by the following
    pseudo-code:

    ```
     long accum = 0L;
     for (int i = 0; i < numBits; i++) {
       accum <<= 1; // Shift left one bit to make room
       accum |= readBit();
     }
    ```

    Note that the result of `readBits(32)` may thus not
    be equal to that of `readInt()` if a reverse network
    byte order is being used (i.e., `getByteOrder() == false`).

    If the end of the stream is encountered before all the bits
    have been read, a `java.io.EOFException` is thrown.

    Parameters:
    :   `numBits` - the number of bits to read, as an `int`
        between 0 and 64, inclusive.

    Returns:
    :   the bitstring, as a `long` with the last bit
        read stored in the least significant bit.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `numBits`
        is not between 0 and 64, inclusive.
    :   `EOFException` - if the stream reaches the end before
        reading all the bits.
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### length

    long length()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Returns the total length of the stream, if known. Otherwise,
    `-1` is returned.

    Returns:
    :   a `long` containing the length of the
        stream, if known, or else `-1`.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### skipBytes

    int skipBytes(int n)
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Moves the stream position forward by a given number of bytes. It
    is possible that this method will only be able to skip forward
    by a smaller number of bytes than requested, for example if the
    end of the stream is reached. In all cases, the actual number
    of bytes skipped is returned. The bit offset is set to zero
    prior to advancing the position.

    Specified by:
    :   `skipBytes` in interface `DataInput`

    Parameters:
    :   `n` - an `int` containing the number of bytes to
        be skipped.

    Returns:
    :   an `int` representing the number of bytes skipped.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### skipBytes

    long skipBytes(long n)
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Moves the stream position forward by a given number of bytes.
    This method is identical to `skipBytes(int)` except
    that it allows for a larger skip distance.

    Parameters:
    :   `n` - a `long` containing the number of bytes to
        be skipped.

    Returns:
    :   a `long` representing the number of bytes
        skipped.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### seek

    void seek(long pos)
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Sets the current stream position to the desired location. The
    next read will occur at this location. The bit offset is set
    to 0.

    An `IndexOutOfBoundsException` will be thrown if
    `pos` is smaller than the flushed position (as
    returned by `getflushedPosition`).

    It is legal to seek past the end of the file;
    a `java.io.EOFException` will be thrown only if a read is
    performed.

    Parameters:
    :   `pos` - a `long` containing the desired file
        pointer position.

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if `pos` is smaller
        than the flushed position.
    :   `IOException` - if any other I/O error occurs.
  + ### mark

    void mark()

    Marks a position in the stream to be returned to by a
    subsequent call to `reset`. Unlike a standard
    `InputStream`, all `ImageInputStream`s
    support marking. Additionally, calls to `mark` and
    `reset` may be nested arbitrarily.

    Unlike the `mark` methods declared by the
    `Reader` and `InputStream` interfaces, no
    `readLimit` parameter is used. An arbitrary amount
    of data may be read following the call to `mark`.

    The bit position used by the `readBits` method
    is saved and restored by each pair of calls to
    `mark` and `reset`.

    Note that it is valid for an `ImageReader` to call
    `flushBefore` as part of a read operation.
    Therefore, if an application calls `mark` prior to
    passing that stream to an `ImageReader`, the application
    should not assume that the marked position will remain valid after
    the read operation has completed.
  + ### reset

    void reset()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Returns the stream pointer to its previous position, including
    the bit offset, at the time of the most recent unmatched call
    to `mark`.

    Calls to `reset` without a corresponding call
    to `mark` have no effect.

    An `IOException` will be thrown if the previous
    marked position lies in the discarded portion of the stream.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### flushBefore

    void flushBefore(long pos)
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Discards the initial portion of the stream prior to the
    indicated position. Attempting to seek to an offset within the
    flushed portion of the stream will result in an
    `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

    Calling `flushBefore` may allow classes
    implementing this interface to free up resources such as memory
    or disk space that are being used to store data from the
    stream.

    Parameters:
    :   `pos` - a `long` containing the length of the
        stream prefix that may be flushed.

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if `pos` lies
        in the flushed portion of the stream or past the current stream
        position.
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### flush

    void flush()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Discards the initial position of the stream prior to the current
    stream position. Equivalent to
    `flushBefore(getStreamPosition())`.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### getFlushedPosition

    long getFlushedPosition()

    Returns the earliest position in the stream to which seeking
    may be performed. The returned value will be the maximum of
    all values passed into previous calls to
    `flushBefore`.

    Returns:
    :   the earliest legal position for seeking, as a
        `long`.
  + ### isCached

    boolean isCached()

    Returns `true` if this `ImageInputStream`
    caches data itself in order to allow seeking backwards.
    Applications may consult this in order to decide how frequently,
    or whether, to flush in order to conserve cache resources.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this `ImageInputStream`
        caches data.

    the cache is kept in main memory. Applications may consult
    this in order to decide how frequently, or whether, to flush
    in order to conserve cache resources.

    Returns `true` if this `ImageInputStream`
    caches data itself in order to allow seeking backwards, and
    the cache is kept in a temporary file. Applications may consult
    this in order to decide how frequently, or whether, to flush
    in order to conserve cache resources.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this `ImageInputStream`
        caches data in a temporary file.
