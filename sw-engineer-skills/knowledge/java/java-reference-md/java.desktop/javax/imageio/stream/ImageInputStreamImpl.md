    protected [ByteOrder](../../../../java.base/java/nio/ByteOrder.md "class in java.nio") byteOrder

    The byte order of the stream as an instance of the enumeration
    class `java.nio.ByteOrder`, where
    `ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN` indicates network byte order
    and `ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN` indicates the reverse
    order. By default, the value is
    `ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN`.
  + ### streamPos

    protected long streamPos

    responsible for keeping this value current from any method they
    override that alters the read position.
  + ### bitOffset

    protected int bitOffset

    The current bit offset within the stream. Subclasses are
    responsible for keeping this value current from any method they
    override that alters the bit offset.
  + ### flushedPos

    to a smaller position is not allowed. `flushedPos`
    will always be >= 0.
* ## Constructor Details

  + ### ImageInputStreamImpl

    public ImageInputStreamImpl()

    Constructs an `ImageInputStreamImpl`.
* ## Method Details

  + ### checkClosed

    protected final void checkClosed()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Throws an `IOException` if the stream has been closed.
    Subclasses may call this method from any of their methods that
    require the stream not to be closed.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if the stream is closed.
  + ### setByteOrder

    public void setByteOrder([ByteOrder](../../../../java.base/java/nio/ByteOrder.md "class in java.nio") byteOrder)

    Description copied from interface: `ImageInputStream`

    Sets the desired byte order for future reads of data values
    from this stream. For example, the sequence of bytes '0x01
    0x02 0x03 0x04' if read as a 4-byte integer would have the
    value '0x01020304' using network byte order and the value
    '0x04030201' under the reverse byte order.

    The enumeration class `java.nio.ByteOrder` is
    used to specify the byte order. A value of
    `ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN` specifies so-called
    big-endian or network byte order, in which the high-order byte
    comes first. Motorola and Sparc processors store data in this
    format, while Intel processors store data in the reverse
    `ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN` order.

    The byte order has no effect on the results returned from
    the `readBits` method (or the value written by
    `ImageOutputStream.writeBits`).

    Specified by:
    :   `setByteOrder` in interface `ImageInputStream`

    Parameters:
    :   `byteOrder` - one of `ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN` or
        `java.nio.ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN`, indicating whether
        network byte order or its reverse will be used for future
        reads.

    Description copied from interface: `ImageInputStream`

    Reads a byte from the stream and returns a `boolean`
    value of `true` if it is nonzero, `false`
    if it is zero.

    The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
    the read occurs.

    Specified by:
    :   `readBoolean` in interface `DataInput`

    Specified by:
    :   `readBoolean` in interface `ImageInputStream`

    Returns:
    :   a boolean value from the stream.

    Throws:

  + ### readByte

    public byte readByte()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Description copied from interface: `ImageInputStream`

    Reads a byte from the stream and returns it as a
    `byte` value. Byte values between `0x00`
    and `0x7f` represent integer values between
    `0` and `127`. Values between
    `0x80` and `0xff` represent negative
    values from `-128` to `/1`.

    The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
    the read occurs.

    Specified by:
    :   `readByte` in interface `DataInput`

    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Description copied from interface: `ImageInputStream`

    Reads a byte from the stream, and (conceptually) converts it to
    an int, masks it with `0xff` in order to strip off
    any sign-extension bits, and returns it as a `byte`
    value.

    Thus, byte values between `0x00` and
    `0x7f` are simply returned as integer values between
    `0` and `127`. Values between
    `0x80` and `0xff`, which normally
    represent negative `byte` values, will be mapped into
    positive integers between `128` and
    `255`.

    The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
    the read occurs.

    public [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") readLine()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Description copied from interface: `ImageInputStream`

    Reads the next line of text from the input stream. It reads
    successive bytes, converting each byte separately into a
    character, until it encounters a line terminator or end of
    file; the characters read are then returned as a
    `String`. Note that because this method processes
    bytes, it does not support input of the full Unicode character
    set.

    If end of file is encountered before even one byte can be
    read, then `null` is returned. Otherwise, each byte
    that is read is converted to type `char` by
    zero-extension. If the character `'\n'` is
    encountered, it is discarded and reading ceases. If the
    character `'\r'` is encountered, it is discarded
    and, if the following byte converts to the character
    `'\n'`, then that is discarded also; reading then
    ceases. If end of file is encountered before either of the
    characters `'\n'` and `'\r'` is
    encountered, reading ceases. Once reading has ceased, a
    `String` is returned that contains all the
    characters read and not discarded, taken in order. Note that
    every character in this string will have a value less than
    `\u0100`, that is, `(char)256`.

    The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
    the read occurs.

    Specified by:
    :   `readLine` in interface `DataInput`

    Specified by:
    :   `readLine` in interface `ImageInputStream`

    Returns:
    :   a String containing a line of text from the stream.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### readUTF

    public [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") readUTF()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Description copied from interface: `ImageInputStream`

    Reads in a string that has been encoded using a
    [modified UTF-8](../../../../java.base/java/io/DataInput.md#modified-utf-8)
    format. The general contract of `readUTF` is that
    it reads a representation of a Unicode character string encoded
    in modified UTF-8 format; this string of characters is
    then returned as a `String`.

    First, two bytes are read and used to construct an unsigned
    16-bit integer in the manner of the
    `readUnsignedShort` method, using network byte order
    (regardless of the current byte order setting). This integer
    value is called the *UTF length* and specifies the number
    of additional bytes to be read. These bytes are then converted
    to characters by considering them in groups. The length of each
    group is computed from the value of the first byte of the
    group. The byte following a group, if any, is the first byte of
    the next group.

    If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern
    `0xxxxxxx` (where `x` means "may be
    `0` or `1`"), then the group consists of
    just that byte. The byte is zero-extended to form a character.

    If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern
    `110xxxxx`, then the group consists of that byte
    `a` and a second byte `b`. If there is no
    byte `b` (because byte `a` was the last
    of the bytes to be read), or if byte `b` does not
    match the bit pattern `10xxxxxx`, then a
    `UTFDataFormatException` is thrown. Otherwise, the
    group is converted to the character:

    ```
     (char)(((a& 0x1F) << 6) | (b & 0x3F))
    ```

    If the first byte of a group matches the bit pattern
    `1110xxxx`, then the group consists of that byte
    `a` and two more bytes `b` and
    `c`. If there is no byte `c` (because
    byte `a` was one of the last two of the bytes to be
    read), or either byte `b` or byte `c`
    does not match the bit pattern `10xxxxxx`, then a
    `UTFDataFormatException` is thrown. Otherwise, the
    group is converted to the character:

    ```
     (char)(((a & 0x0F) << 12) | ((b & 0x3F) << 6) | (c & 0x3F))
    ```

    If the first byte of a group matches the pattern
    `1111xxxx` or the pattern `10xxxxxx`,
    then a `UTFDataFormatException` is thrown.

    If end of file is encountered at any time during this
    entire process, then a `java.io.EOFException` is thrown.

    After every group has been converted to a character by this
    process, the characters are gathered, in the same order in
    which their corresponding groups were read from the input
    stream, to form a `String`, which is returned.

    The current byte order setting is ignored.

    The bit offset within the stream is reset to zero before
    the read occurs.

    **Note:** This method should not be used in
    the implementation of image formats that use standard UTF-8,
    because the modified UTF-8 used here is incompatible with
    standard UTF-8.

    Specified by:
    :   `readUTF` in interface `ImageInputStream`

    Description copied from interface: `ImageInputStream`

    Returns the current bit offset, as an integer between 0 and 7,
    inclusive. The bit offset is updated implicitly by calls to
    the `readBits` method. A value of 0 indicates the
    most-significant bit, and a value of 7 indicates the least
    significant bit, of the byte being read.

    The bit offset is set to 0 when a stream is first
    opened, and is reset to 0 by calls to `seek`,
    `skipBytes`, or any `read` or
    `readFully` method.

    Specified by:
    :   `getBitOffset` in interface `ImageInputStream`

    Returns:
    :   an `int` containing the bit offset between
        0 and 7, inclusive.

    Throws:

  + ### setBitOffset

    public void setBitOffset(int bitOffset)
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Description copied from interface: `ImageInputStream`

    Sets the bit offset to an integer between 0 and 7, inclusive.
    The byte offset within the stream, as returned by
    `getStreamPosition`, is left unchanged.
    A value of 0 indicates the
    most-significant bit, and a value of 7 indicates the least
    significant bit, of the byte being read.

    Specified by:
    :   `setBitOffset` in interface `ImageInputStream`

    Parameters:
    :   `bitOffset` - the desired offset, as an `int`
        between 0 and 7, inclusive.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.

  + ### readBit

    public int readBit()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Description copied from interface: `ImageInputStream`

    Reads a single bit from the stream and returns it as an
    `int` with the value `0` or
    `1`. The bit offset is advanced by one and reduced
    modulo 8.

    Specified by:
    :   `readBit` in interface `ImageInputStream`

    Returns:
    :   an `int` containing the value `0`
        or `1`.

    Throws:
    :   `EOFException` - if the stream reaches the end before
        reading all the bits.
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### readBits

    public long readBits(int numBits)
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Description copied from interface: `ImageInputStream`

    Reads a bitstring from the stream and returns it as a
    `long`, with the first bit read becoming the most
    significant bit of the output. The read starts within the byte
    indicated by `getStreamPosition`, at the bit given
    by `getBitOffset`. The bit offset is advanced by
    `numBits` and reduced modulo 8.

    The byte order of the stream has no effect on this
    method. The return value of this method is constructed as
    though the bits were read one at a time, and shifted into
    the right side of the return value, as shown by the following
    pseudo-code:

    ```
     long accum = 0L;
     for (int i = 0; i < numBits; i++) {
       accum <<= 1; // Shift left one bit to make room
       accum |= readBit();
     }
    ```

    Note that the result of `readBits(32)` may thus not
    be equal to that of `readInt()` if a reverse network
    byte order is being used (i.e., `getByteOrder() == false`).

    If the end of the stream is encountered before all the bits
    have been read, a `java.io.EOFException` is thrown.

    Specified by:
    :   `readBits` in interface `ImageInputStream`

    Parameters:
    :   `numBits` - the number of bits to read, as an `int`
        between 0 and 64, inclusive.

    Returns:
    :   the bitstring, as a `long` with the last bit
        read stored in the least significant bit.

    Throws:
    :   `EOFException` - if the stream reaches the end before
        reading all the bits.
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### length

    public long length()

    Returns `-1L` to indicate that the stream has unknown
    length. Subclasses must override this method to provide actual
    length information.

    Specified by:
    :   `length` in interface `ImageInputStream`

    Returns:
    :   -1L to indicate unknown length.

    Resets the current stream byte and bit positions from the stack
    of marked positions.

    An `IOException` will be thrown if the previous
    marked position lies in the discarded portion of the stream.

    Specified by:
    :   `reset` in interface `ImageInputStream`

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### flushBefore

    public void flushBefore(long pos)
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Description copied from interface: `ImageInputStream`

    Discards the initial portion of the stream prior to the
    indicated position. Attempting to seek to an offset within the
    flushed portion of the stream will result in an
    `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.

    Calling `flushBefore` may allow classes
    implementing this interface to free up resources such as memory
    or disk space that are being used to store data from the
    stream.

    Specified by:
    :   `flushBefore` in interface `ImageInputStream`

    Parameters:
    :   `pos` - a `long` containing the length of the
        stream prefix that may be flushed.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### flush

    public void flush()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Description copied from interface: `ImageInputStream`

    Discards the initial position of the stream prior to the current
    stream position. Equivalent to
    `flushBefore(getStreamPosition())`.

    Specified by:
    :   `flush` in interface `ImageInputStream`

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### getFlushedPosition

    public long getFlushedPosition()

    Description copied from interface: `ImageInputStream`

    Returns the earliest position in the stream to which seeking
    may be performed. The returned value will be the maximum of
    all values passed into previous calls to
    `flushBefore`.

    Specified by:
    :   `getFlushedPosition` in interface `ImageInputStream`

    Returns:
    :   the earliest legal position for seeking, as a
        `long`.
  + ### isCached

    public boolean isCached()

    Default implementation returns false. Subclasses should
    override this if they cache data.

    Specified by:
    :   `isCached` in interface `ImageInputStream`

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this `ImageInputStream`
        caches data.

    See Also:
    :   - [`ImageInputStream.isCachedMemory()`](ImageInputStream.md#isCachedMemory())
        - [`ImageInputStream.isCachedFile()`](ImageInputStream.md#isCachedFile())
  + ### isCachedMemory

    public boolean isCachedMemory()

    Default implementation returns false. Subclasses should
    override this if they cache data in main memory.

    Specified by:
    :   `isCachedMemory` in interface `ImageInputStream`

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this `ImageInputStream`
        caches data in main memory.

    See Also:
    :   - [`ImageInputStream.isCached()`](ImageInputStream.md#isCached())
        - [`ImageInputStream.isCachedFile()`](ImageInputStream.md#isCachedFile())
  + ### isCachedFile

    public boolean isCachedFile()

    Default implementation returns false. Subclasses should
    override this if they cache data in a temporary file.

    Specified by:
    :   `isCachedFile` in interface `ImageInputStream`

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this `ImageInputStream`
        caches data in a temporary file.

    See Also:
    :   - [`ImageInputStream.isCached()`](ImageInputStream.md#isCached())

  + ### close

    public void close()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Description copied from interface: `ImageInputStream`

    Closes the stream. Attempts to access a stream that has been
    closed may result in `IOException`s or incorrect
    behavior. Calling this method may allow classes implementing
    this interface to release resources associated with the stream
    such as memory, disk space, or file descriptors.

    Specified by:
    :   `close` in interface `AutoCloseable`

    Specified by:
    :   `close` in interface `Closeable`

    Specified by:
    :   `close` in interface `ImageInputStream`

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### finalize

    [forRemoval](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Deprecated.md#forRemoval())=true)
    protected void finalize()
    throws [Throwable](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Throwable.md "class in java.lang")

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Finalization has been deprecated for removal. See
    [`Object.finalize()`](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md#finalize()) for background information and details
    about migration options.

    Finalizes this object prior to garbage collection. The
    `close` method is called to close any open input
    source. This method should not be called from application
    code.

    Overrides:
    :   `finalize` in class `Object`

    Throws:
    :   `Throwable` - if an error occurs during superclass
        finalization.
