# Interface RenderableImage

public interface RenderableImage

A RenderableImage is a common interface for rendering-independent
images (a notion which subsumes resolution independence). That is,
images which are described and have operations applied to them
independent of any specific rendering of the image. For example, a
RenderableImage can be rotated and cropped in
resolution-independent terms. Then, it can be rendered for various
specific contexts, such as a draft preview, a high-quality screen
display, or a printer, each in an optimal fashion.

A RenderedImage is returned from a RenderableImage via the
createRendering() method, which takes a RenderContext. The
RenderContext specifies how the RenderedImage should be
constructed. Note that it is not possible to extract pixels
directly from a RenderableImage.

The createDefaultRendering() and createScaledRendering() methods are
convenience methods that construct an appropriate RenderContext
internally. All of the rendering methods may return a reference to a
previously produced rendering.

* ## Field Details

  + ### HINTS\_OBSERVED

    static final [String](../../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") HINTS\_OBSERVED

    String constant that can be used to identify a property on
    a RenderedImage obtained via the createRendering or
    createScaledRendering methods. If such a property exists,
    the value of the property will be a RenderingHints object
    specifying which hints were observed in creating the rendering.

* ## Method Details

  + ### getSources

    [Vector](../../../../../java.base/java/util/Vector.md "class in java.util")<[RenderableImage](RenderableImage.md "interface in java.awt.image.renderable")> getSources()

    Returns a vector of RenderableImages that are the sources of
    image data for this RenderableImage. Note that this method may
    return an empty vector, to indicate that the image has no sources,
    or null, to indicate that no information is available.

    Returns:
    :   a (possibly empty) Vector of RenderableImages, or null.
  + ### getProperty

    [Object](../../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") getProperty([String](../../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name)

    Gets a property from the property set of this image.
    If the property name is not recognized, java.awt.Image.UndefinedProperty
    will be returned.

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - the name of the property to get, as a String.

    Returns:
    :   a reference to the property Object, or the value
        java.awt.Image.UndefinedProperty.
  + ### getPropertyNames

    [String](../../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] getPropertyNames()

    Returns a list of names recognized by getProperty.

    Returns:
    :   a list of property names.
  + ### isDynamic

    boolean isDynamic()

    Returns true if successive renderings (that is, calls to
    createRendering() or createScaledRendering()) with the same arguments
    may produce different results. This method may be used to
    determine whether an existing rendering may be cached and
    reused. It is always safe to return true.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if successive renderings with the
        same arguments might produce different results;
        `false` otherwise.
  + ### getWidth

    float getWidth()

    Gets the width in user coordinate space. By convention, the
    usual width of a RenderableImage is equal to the image's aspect
    ratio (width divided by height).

    Returns:
    :   the width of the image in user coordinates.
  + ### getHeight

    float getHeight()

    Gets the height in user coordinate space. By convention, the
    usual height of a RenderedImage is equal to 1.0F.

    Returns:
    :   the height of the image in user coordinates.
  + ### getMinX

    float getMinX()

    Gets the minimum X coordinate of the rendering-independent image data.

    Returns:
    :   the minimum X coordinate of the rendering-independent image
        data.
  + ### getMinY

    float getMinY()

    Gets the minimum Y coordinate of the rendering-independent image data.

    Returns:
    :   the minimum Y coordinate of the rendering-independent image
        data.
  + ### createScaledRendering

    [RenderedImage](../RenderedImage.md "interface in java.awt.image") createScaledRendering(int w,
    int h,
    [RenderingHints](../../RenderingHints.md "class in java.awt") hints)

    Creates a RenderedImage instance of this image with width w, and
    height h in pixels. The RenderContext is built automatically
    with an appropriate usr2dev transform and an area of interest
    of the full image. All the rendering hints come from hints
    passed in.

    If w == 0, it will be taken to equal
    Math.round(h\*(getWidth()/getHeight())).
    Similarly, if h == 0, it will be taken to equal
    Math.round(w\*(getHeight()/getWidth())). One of
    w or h must be non-zero or else an IllegalArgumentException
    will be thrown.

    The created RenderedImage may have a property identified
    by the String HINTS\_OBSERVED to indicate which RenderingHints
    were used to create the image. In addition any RenderedImages
    that are obtained via the getSources() method on the created
    RenderedImage may have such a property.

    Parameters:
    :   `w` - the width of rendered image in pixels, or 0.
    :   `h` - the height of rendered image in pixels, or 0.
    :   `hints` - a RenderingHints object containing hints.

    Returns:
    :   a RenderedImage containing the rendered data.
  + ### createDefaultRendering

    [RenderedImage](../RenderedImage.md "interface in java.awt.image") createDefaultRendering()

    Returns a RenderedImage instance of this image with a default
    width and height in pixels. The RenderContext is built
    automatically with an appropriate usr2dev transform and an area
    of interest of the full image. The rendering hints are
    empty. createDefaultRendering may make use of a stored
    rendering for speed.

    Returns:
    :   a RenderedImage containing the rendered data.
  + ### createRendering

    [RenderedImage](../RenderedImage.md "interface in java.awt.image") createRendering([RenderContext](RenderContext.md "class in java.awt.image.renderable") renderContext)

    Creates a RenderedImage that represented a rendering of this image
    using a given RenderContext. This is the most general way to obtain a
    rendering of a RenderableImage.

    The created RenderedImage may have a property identified
    by the String HINTS\_OBSERVED to indicate which RenderingHints
    (from the RenderContext) were used to create the image.
    In addition any RenderedImages
    that are obtained via the getSources() method on the created
    RenderedImage may have such a property.

    Parameters:
    :   `renderContext` - the RenderContext to use to produce the rendering.

    Returns:
    :   a RenderedImage containing the rendered data.
