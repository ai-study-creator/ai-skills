public interface ImageConsumer

The interface for objects expressing interest in image data through
the ImageProducer interfaces. When a consumer is added to an image
producer, the producer delivers all of the data about the image
using the method calls defined in this interface.

* ## Field Details

  + ### RANDOMPIXELORDER

    static final int RANDOMPIXELORDER

    The pixels will be delivered in a random order. This tells the
    ImageConsumer not to use any optimizations that depend on the
    order of pixel delivery, which should be the default assumption
    in the absence of any call to the setHints method.

    :   - [`setHints(int)`](#setHints(int))
        - [Constant Field Values](../../../../constant-values.md#java.awt.image.ImageConsumer.RANDOMPIXELORDER)
  + ### TOPDOWNLEFTRIGHT

    static final int TOPDOWNLEFTRIGHT

    The pixels will be delivered in top-down, left-to-right order.

    See Also:
    :   - [`setHints(int)`](#setHints(int))
        - [Constant Field Values](../../../../constant-values.md#java.awt.image.ImageConsumer.TOPDOWNLEFTRIGHT)
  + ### COMPLETESCANLINES

    static final int COMPLETESCANLINES

    The pixels will be delivered in (multiples of) complete scanlines
    at a time.

    See Also:
    :   - [`setHints(int)`](#setHints(int))
        - [Constant Field Values](../../../../constant-values.md#java.awt.image.ImageConsumer.COMPLETESCANLINES)
  + ### SINGLEPASS

    static final int SINGLEPASS

    The pixels will be delivered in a single pass. Each pixel will
    appear in only one call to any of the setPixels methods. An
    example of an image format which does not meet this criterion
    is a progressive JPEG image which defines pixels in multiple
    passes, each more refined than the previous.

    See Also:
    :   - [`setHints(int)`](#setHints(int))
        - [Constant Field Values](../../../../constant-values.md#java.awt.image.ImageConsumer.SINGLEPASS)
  + ### SINGLEFRAME

    static final int SINGLEFRAME

    The image contain a single static image. The pixels will be defined
    in calls to the setPixels methods and then the imageComplete method
    will be called with the STATICIMAGEDONE flag after which no more
    image data will be delivered. An example of an image type which
    would not meet these criteria would be the output of a video feed,
    or the representation of a 3D rendering being manipulated
    by the user. The end of each frame in those types of images will
    be indicated by calling imageComplete with the SINGLEFRAMEDONE flag.

  + ### IMAGEERROR

    static final int IMAGEERROR

    An error was encountered while producing the image.

    static final int SINGLEFRAMEDONE

    One frame of the image is complete but there are more frames
    to be delivered.

* ## Method Details

  + ### setDimensions

    void setDimensions(int width,
    int height)

    The dimensions of the source image are reported using the
    setDimensions method call.

    Parameters:
    :   `width` - the width of the source image
    :   `height` - the height of the source image
  + ### setProperties

    void setProperties([Hashtable](../../../../java.base/java/util/Hashtable.md "class in java.util")<?,?> props)

    Sets the extensible list of properties associated with this image.

    Parameters:
    :   `props` - the list of properties to be associated with this
        image
  + ### setColorModel

    void setColorModel([ColorModel](ColorModel.md "class in java.awt.image") model)

    Sets the ColorModel object used for the majority of
    the pixels reported using the setPixels method
    calls. Note that each set of pixels delivered using setPixels
    contains its own ColorModel object, so no assumption should
    be made that this model will be the only one used in delivering
    pixel values. A notable case where multiple ColorModel objects
    may be seen is a filtered image when for each set of pixels
    that it filters, the filter
    determines whether the
    pixels can be sent on untouched, using the original ColorModel,
    or whether the pixels should be modified (filtered) and passed
    on using a ColorModel more convenient for the filtering process.

    Parameters:
    :   `model` - the specified `ColorModel`

    See Also:
    :   - [`ColorModel`](ColorModel.md "class in java.awt.image")
  + ### setHints

    void setHints(int hintflags)

    Sets the hints that the ImageConsumer uses to process the
    pixels delivered by the ImageProducer.
    The ImageProducer can deliver the pixels in any order, but
    the ImageConsumer may be able to scale or convert the pixels
    to the destination ColorModel more efficiently or with higher
    quality if it knows some information about how the pixels will
    be delivered up front. The setHints method should be called
    before any calls to any of the setPixels methods with a bit mask
    of hints about the manner in which the pixels will be delivered.
    If the ImageProducer does not follow the guidelines for the
    indicated hint, the results are undefined.

    Parameters:
    :   `hintflags` - a set of hints that the ImageConsumer uses to
        process the pixels
  + ### setPixels

    void setPixels(int x,
    int y,
    int w,
    int h,
    [ColorModel](ColorModel.md "class in java.awt.image") model,
    byte[] pixels,
    int off,
    int scansize)

    Delivers the pixels of the image with one or more calls
    to this method. Each call specifies the location and
    size of the rectangle of source pixels that are contained in
    the array of pixels. The specified ColorModel object should
    be used to convert the pixels into their corresponding color
    and alpha components. Pixel (m,n) is stored in the pixels array
    at index (n \* scansize + m + off). The pixels delivered using
    this method are all stored as bytes.

    Parameters:
    :   `x` - the X coordinate of the upper-left corner of the
        area of pixels to be set
    :   `y` - the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner of the
        area of pixels to be set
    :   `w` - the width of the area of pixels
    :   `h` - the height of the area of pixels
    :   `model` - the specified `ColorModel`
    :   `pixels` - the array of pixels
    :   `off` - the offset into the `pixels` array
    :   `scansize` - the distance from one row of pixels to the next in
        the `pixels` array

    See Also:
    :   - [`ColorModel`](ColorModel.md "class in java.awt.image")
  + ### setPixels

    void setPixels(int x,
    int y,
    int w,
    int h,
    [ColorModel](ColorModel.md "class in java.awt.image") model,
    int[] pixels,
    int off,
    int scansize)

    The pixels of the image are delivered using one or more calls
    to the setPixels method. Each call specifies the location and
    size of the rectangle of source pixels that are contained in
    the array of pixels. The specified ColorModel object should
    be used to convert the pixels into their corresponding color
    and alpha components. Pixel (m,n) is stored in the pixels array
    at index (n \* scansize + m + off). The pixels delivered using
    this method are all stored as ints.
    this method are all stored as ints.

    Parameters:
    :   `x` - the X coordinate of the upper-left corner of the
        area of pixels to be set
    :   `y` - the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner of the
        area of pixels to be set
    :   `w` - the width of the area of pixels
    :   `h` - the height of the area of pixels
    :   `model` - the specified `ColorModel`
    :   `pixels` - the array of pixels
    :   `off` - the offset into the `pixels` array
    :   `scansize` - the distance from one row of pixels to the next in
        the `pixels` array

    :   - [`ColorModel`](ColorModel.md "class in java.awt.image")
  + ### imageComplete

    void imageComplete(int status)

    The imageComplete method is called when the ImageProducer is
    finished delivering all of the pixels that the source image
    contains, or when a single frame of a multi-frame animation has
    been completed, or when an error in loading or producing the
    image has occurred. The ImageConsumer should remove itself from the
    list of consumers registered with the ImageProducer at this time,
    unless it is interested in successive frames.

    Parameters:
    :   `status` - the status of image loading
