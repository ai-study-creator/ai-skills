java.awt.image.ImageFilter

All Implemented Interfaces:

public class ImageFilter
extends [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [ImageConsumer](ImageConsumer.md "interface in java.awt.image"), [Cloneable](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Cloneable.md "interface in java.lang")

This class implements a filter for the set of interface methods that
are used to deliver data from an ImageProducer to an ImageConsumer.
It is meant to be used in conjunction with a FilteredImageSource
object to produce filtered versions of existing images. It is a
base class that provides the calls needed to implement a "Null filter"
which has no effect on the data being passed through. Filters should
subclass this class and override the methods which deal with the
data that needs to be filtered and modify it as necessary.

    protected [ImageConsumer](ImageConsumer.md "interface in java.awt.image") consumer

    The consumer of the particular image data stream for which this
    instance of the ImageFilter is filtering data. It is not
    initialized during the constructor, but rather during the
    getFilterInstance() method call when the FilteredImageSource
    is creating a unique instance of this object for a particular
    image data stream.

    Parameters:
    :   `status` - the status of image loading

  + ### resendTopDownLeftRight

    public void resendTopDownLeftRight([ImageProducer](ImageProducer.md "interface in java.awt.image") ip)

    Responds to a request for a TopDownLeftRight (TDLR) ordered resend
    of the pixel data from an `ImageConsumer`.
    When an `ImageConsumer` being fed
    by an instance of this `ImageFilter`
    requests a resend of the data in TDLR order,
    the `FilteredImageSource`
    invokes this method of the `ImageFilter`.

    An `ImageFilter` subclass might override this method or not,
    depending on if and how it can send data in TDLR order.
    Three possibilities exist:
    - Do not override this method.
      This makes the subclass use the default implementation,
      which is to
      forward the request
      to the indicated `ImageProducer`
      using this filter as the requesting `ImageConsumer`.
      This behavior
      is appropriate if the filter can determine
      that it will forward the pixels
      in TDLR order if its upstream producer object
      sends them in TDLR order.- Override the method to simply send the data.
        This is appropriate if the filter can handle the request itself —
        for example,
        if the generated pixels have been saved in some sort of buffer.- Override the method to do nothing.
          This is appropriate
          if the filter cannot produce filtered data in TDLR order.

    Parameters:
    :   `ip` - the ImageProducer that is feeding this instance of
        the filter - also the ImageProducer that the request should be
        forwarded to if necessary

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `ip` is null

    :   - [`ImageProducer.requestTopDownLeftRightResend(java.awt.image.ImageConsumer)`](ImageProducer.md#requestTopDownLeftRightResend(java.awt.image.ImageConsumer))
  + ### clone

    public [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") clone()

    Clones this object.

    Overrides:
    :   `clone` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a clone of this instance.
