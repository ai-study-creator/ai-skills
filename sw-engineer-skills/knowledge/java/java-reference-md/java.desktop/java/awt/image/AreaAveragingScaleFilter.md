public class AreaAveragingScaleFilter
extends [ReplicateScaleFilter](ReplicateScaleFilter.md "class in java.awt.image")

An ImageFilter class for scaling images using a simple area averaging
algorithm that produces smoother results than the nearest neighbor
algorithm.

This class extends the basic ImageFilter Class to scale an existing
image and provide a source for a new image containing the resampled
image. The pixels in the source image are blended to produce pixels
for an image of the specified size. The blending process is analogous
to scaling up the source image to a multiple of the destination size
using pixel replication and then scaling it back down to the destination
size by simply averaging all the pixels in the supersized image that
fall within a given pixel of the destination image. If the data from
the source is not delivered in TopDownLeftRight order then the filter
will back off to a simple pixel replication behavior and utilize the
requestTopDownLeftRightResend() method to refilter the pixels in a
better way at the end.

It is meant to be used in conjunction with a FilteredImageSource
object to produce scaled versions of existing images. Due to
implementation dependencies, there may be differences in pixel values
of an image filtered on different platforms.

    public AreaAveragingScaleFilter(int width,
    int height)

    Constructs an AreaAveragingScaleFilter that scales the pixels from
    its source Image as specified by the width and height parameters.

    Parameters:
    :   `width` - the target width to scale the image
    :   `height` - the target height to scale the image

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `width` equals
        zero or `height` equals zero
* ## Method Details

  + ### setHints

    public void setHints(int hints)

    Detect if the data is being delivered with the necessary hints
    to allow the averaging algorithm to do its work.

    Note: This method is intended to be called by the
    `ImageProducer` of the `Image` whose
    pixels are being filtered. Developers using
    this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling
    this method directly since that operation could interfere
    with the filtering operation.

    Specified by:
    :   `setHints` in interface `ImageConsumer`

    Overrides:
    :   `setHints` in class `ImageFilter`

    Parameters:
    :   `hints` - a set of hints that the ImageConsumer uses to
        process the pixels

    :   - [`ImageConsumer.setHints(int)`](ImageConsumer.md#setHints(int))
  + ### setPixels

    public void setPixels(int x,
    int y,
    int w,
    int h,
    [ColorModel](ColorModel.md "class in java.awt.image") model,
    byte[] pixels,
    int off,
    int scansize)

    Combine the components for the delivered byte pixels into the
    accumulation arrays and send on any averaged data for rows of
    pixels that are complete. If the correct hints were not
    specified in the setHints call then relay the work to our
    superclass which is capable of scaling pixels regardless of
    the delivery hints.

    Note: This method is intended to be called by the
    `ImageProducer` of the `Image`
    whose pixels are being filtered. Developers using
    this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling
    this method directly since that operation could interfere
    with the filtering operation.

    Specified by:
    :   `setPixels` in interface `ImageConsumer`

    Overrides:
    :   `setPixels` in class `ReplicateScaleFilter`

    Parameters:
    :   `x` - the X coordinate of the upper-left corner of the
        area of pixels to be set
    :   `y` - the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner of the
        area of pixels to be set
    :   `w` - the width of the area of pixels
    :   `h` - the height of the area of pixels
    :   `model` - the specified `ColorModel`
    :   `pixels` - the array of pixels
    :   `off` - the offset into the `pixels` array
    :   `scansize` - the distance from one row of pixels to the next in
        the `pixels` array
