# Class Path2D

java.awt.geom.Path2D

All Implemented Interfaces:
:   `Shape`, `Cloneable`

Direct Known Subclasses:
:   `Path2D.Double`, `Path2D.Float`

---

public abstract sealed class Path2D
extends [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Shape](../Shape.md "interface in java.awt"), [Cloneable](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Cloneable.md "interface in java.lang")
permits [Path2D.Double](Path2D.Double.md "class in java.awt.geom"), [Path2D.Float](Path2D.Float.md "class in java.awt.geom")

The `Path2D` class provides a simple, yet flexible
shape which represents an arbitrary geometric path.
It can fully represent any path which can be iterated by the
[`PathIterator`](PathIterator.md "interface in java.awt.geom") interface including all of its segment
types and winding rules and it implements all of the
basic hit testing methods of the [`Shape`](../Shape.md "interface in java.awt") interface.

Use [`Path2D.Float`](Path2D.Float.md "class in java.awt.geom") when dealing with data that can be represented
and used with floating point precision. Use [`Path2D.Double`](Path2D.Double.md "class in java.awt.geom")
for data that requires the accuracy or range of double precision.

`Path2D` provides exactly those facilities required for
basic construction and management of a geometric path and
implementation of the above interfaces with little added
interpretation.
If it is useful to manipulate the interiors of closed
geometric shapes beyond simple hit testing then the
[`Area`](Area.md "class in java.awt.geom") class provides additional capabilities
specifically targeted at closed figures.
While both classes nominally implement the `Shape`
interface, they differ in purpose and together they provide
two useful views of a geometric shape where `Path2D`
deals primarily with a trajectory formed by path segments
and `Area` deals more with interpretation and manipulation
of enclosed regions of 2D geometric space.

The [`PathIterator`](PathIterator.md "interface in java.awt.geom") interface has more detailed descriptions
of the types of segments that make up a path and the winding rules
that control how to determine which regions are inside or outside
the path.

    public final void append([Shape](../Shape.md "interface in java.awt") s,
    boolean connect)

    Appends the geometry of the specified `Shape` object to the
    path, possibly connecting the new geometry to the existing path
    segments with a line segment.
    If the `connect` parameter is `true` and the

    If the destination coordinates of such a connecting `lineTo`
    segment match the ending coordinates of a currently open
    subpath then the segment is omitted as superfluous.
    The winding rule of the specified `Shape` is ignored
    and the appended geometry is governed by the winding
    rule specified for this path.

    Parameters:
    :   `s` - the `Shape` whose geometry is appended
        to this path
    :   `connect` - a boolean to control whether or not to turn an initial
        `moveTo` segment into a `lineTo` segment

    to the path, possibly connecting the new geometry to the existing
    path segments with a line segment.
    If the `connect` parameter is `true` and the
    path is not empty then any initial `moveTo` in the
    geometry of the appended `Shape` is turned into a
    `lineTo` segment.
    If the destination coordinates of such a connecting `lineTo`
    segment match the ending coordinates of a currently open
    subpath then the segment is omitted as superfluous.

    and the appended geometry is governed by the winding
    rule specified for this path.

    Parameters:
    :   `pi` - the `PathIterator` whose geometry is appended to
        this path
    :   `connect` - a boolean to control whether or not to turn an initial
        `moveTo` segment into a `lineTo` segment
        to connect the new geometry to the existing path

  + ### getWindingRule

    public final int getWindingRule()

    Returns the fill style winding rule.

    Returns:
    :   an integer representing the current winding rule.

        [`WIND_NON_ZERO`](#WIND_NON_ZERO)

    Since:
    :   1.6

    See Also:

    Returns the coordinates most recently added to the end of the path
    as a [`Point2D`](Point2D.md "class in java.awt.geom") object.

    Returns:
    :   a `Point2D` object containing the ending coordinates of
        the path or `null` if there are no points in the path.

    Since:
    :   1.6
  + ### reset

    public final void reset()

    Resets the path to empty. The append position is set back to the

    Transforms the geometry of this path using the specified
    [`AffineTransform`](AffineTransform.md "class in java.awt.geom").
    The geometry is transformed in place, which permanently changes the
    boundary defined by this object.

    Parameters:

  + ### createTransformedShape

    public final [Shape](../Shape.md "interface in java.awt") createTransformedShape([AffineTransform](AffineTransform.md "class in java.awt.geom") at)

    Returns a new `Shape` representing a transformed version
    of this `Path2D`.
    Note that the exact type and coordinate precision of the return
    value is not specified for this method.
    The method will return a Shape that contains no less precision
    for the transformed geometry than this `Path2D` currently
    maintains, but it may contain no more precision either.
    If the tradeoff of precision vs. storage size in the result is
    important then the convenience constructors in the
    [`Path2D.Float`](Path2D.Float.md#%3Cinit%3E(java.awt.Shape,java.awt.geom.AffineTransform))
    and
    [`Path2D.Double`](Path2D.Double.md#%3Cinit%3E(java.awt.Shape,java.awt.geom.AffineTransform))
    subclasses should be used to make the choice explicit.

    Parameters:
    :   `at` - the `AffineTransform` used to transform a
        new `Shape`.

    Returns:
    :   a new `Shape`, transformed with the specified
        `AffineTransform`.

    Since:
    :   1.6
  + ### getBounds

    public final [Rectangle](../Rectangle.md "class in java.awt") getBounds()

    Returns an integer [`Rectangle`](../Rectangle.md "class in java.awt") that completely encloses the
    `Shape`. Note that there is no guarantee that the
    returned `Rectangle` is the smallest bounding box that
    encloses the `Shape`, only that the `Shape`
    lies entirely within the indicated `Rectangle`. The
    returned `Rectangle` might also fail to completely
    enclose the `Shape` if the `Shape` overflows
    the limited range of the integer data type. The
    `getBounds2D` method generally returns a
    tighter bounding box due to its greater flexibility in
    representation.

    Note that the
    [definition of insideness](../Shape.md#def_insideness) can lead to situations where points
    on the defining outline of the `shape` may not be considered
    contained in the returned `bounds` object, but only in cases
    where those points are also not considered contained in the original
    `shape`.

    If a `point` is inside the `shape` according to the
    [`contains(point)`](../Shape.md#contains(double,double)) method, then
    it must be inside the returned `Rectangle` bounds object
    according to the [`contains(point)`](../Shape.md#contains(double,double))
    method of the `bounds`. Specifically:

    `shape.contains(x,y)` requires `bounds.contains(x,y)`

    If a `point` is not inside the `shape`, then it might
    still be contained in the `bounds` object:

    `bounds.contains(x,y)` does not imply `shape.contains(x,y)`

    Specified by:
    :   `getBounds` in interface `Shape`

    Returns:
    :   an integer `Rectangle` that completely encloses
        the `Shape`.

    boundary of the specified [`PathIterator`](PathIterator.md "interface in java.awt.geom").

    Tests if the specified [`Point2D`](Point2D.md "class in java.awt.geom") is inside the closed
    boundary of the specified [`PathIterator`](PathIterator.md "interface in java.awt.geom").

    This method provides a basic facility for implementors of
    the [`Shape`](../Shape.md "interface in java.awt") interface to implement support for the
    [`Shape.contains(Point2D)`](../Shape.md#contains(java.awt.geom.Point2D)) method.

    Parameters:
    :   `pi` - the specified `PathIterator`
    :   `p` - the specified `Point2D`

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the specified coordinates are inside the
        specified `PathIterator`; `false` otherwise

    public final boolean contains(double x,

    Tests if the specified coordinates are inside the boundary of the
    `Shape`, as described by the
    [definition of insideness](../Shape.md#def_insideness).

    Specified by:
    :   `contains` in interface `Shape`

    Parameters:
    :   `x` - the specified X coordinate to be tested
    :   `y` - the specified Y coordinate to be tested

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the specified coordinates are inside
        the `Shape` boundary; `false`
        otherwise.

    Since:
    :   1.6
  + ### contains

    public final boolean contains([Point2D](Point2D.md "class in java.awt.geom") p)

    Tests if a specified [`Point2D`](Point2D.md "class in java.awt.geom") is inside the boundary
    of the `Shape`, as described by the
    [definition of insideness](../../../../java.desktop/java/awt/Shape.md#def_insideness).

    Specified by:
    :   `contains` in interface `Shape`

    Parameters:
    :   `p` - the specified `Point2D` to be tested

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the specified `Point2D` is
        inside the boundary of the `Shape`;
        `false` otherwise.

    public static boolean contains([PathIterator](PathIterator.md "interface in java.awt.geom") pi,
    double x,
    double y,
    double w,
    double h)

    Tests if the specified rectangular area is entirely inside the
    closed boundary of the specified [`PathIterator`](PathIterator.md "interface in java.awt.geom").

    This method provides a basic facility for implementors of
    the [`Shape`](../Shape.md "interface in java.awt") interface to implement support for the
    [`Shape.contains(double, double, double, double)`](../Shape.md#contains(double,double,double,double)) method.

    This method object may conservatively return false in
    cases where the specified rectangular area intersects a
    segment of the path, but that segment does not represent a
    boundary between the interior and exterior of the path.
    Such segments could lie entirely within the interior of the
    path if they are part of a path with a [`WIND_NON_ZERO`](#WIND_NON_ZERO)
    winding rule or if the segments are retraced in the reverse
    direction such that the two sets of segments cancel each
    other out without any exterior area falling between them.
    To determine whether segments represent true boundaries of
    the interior of the path would require extensive calculations
    involving all of the segments of the path and the winding
    rule and are thus beyond the scope of this implementation.

    Parameters:
    :   `pi` - the specified `PathIterator`
    :   `x` - the specified X coordinate
    :   `y` - the specified Y coordinate
    :   `w` - the width of the specified rectangular area
    :   `h` - the height of the specified rectangular area

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the specified `PathIterator` contains
        the specified rectangular area; `false` otherwise.

    public static boolean contains([PathIterator](PathIterator.md "interface in java.awt.geom") pi,

    Tests if the specified [`Rectangle2D`](Rectangle2D.md "class in java.awt.geom") is entirely inside the
    closed boundary of the specified [`PathIterator`](PathIterator.md "interface in java.awt.geom").

    This method provides a basic facility for implementors of
    the [`Shape`](../Shape.md "interface in java.awt") interface to implement support for the
    [`Shape.contains(Rectangle2D)`](../Shape.md#contains(java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D)) method.

    This method object may conservatively return false in
    cases where the specified rectangular area intersects a
    segment of the path, but that segment does not represent a
    boundary between the interior and exterior of the path.
    Such segments could lie entirely within the interior of the
    path if they are part of a path with a [`WIND_NON_ZERO`](#WIND_NON_ZERO)
    winding rule or if the segments are retraced in the reverse
    direction such that the two sets of segments cancel each
    other out without any exterior area falling between them.
    To determine whether segments represent true boundaries of
    the interior of the path would require extensive calculations
    involving all of the segments of the path and the winding
    rule and are thus beyond the scope of this implementation.

    Parameters:
    :   `pi` - the specified `PathIterator`
    :   `r` - a specified `Rectangle2D`

    public final boolean contains(double x,

    Tests if the interior of the `Shape` entirely contains
    the specified rectangular area. All coordinates that lie inside
    the rectangular area must lie within the `Shape` for the
    entire rectangular area to be considered contained within the
    `Shape`.

    The `Shape.contains()` method allows a `Shape`
    implementation to conservatively return `false` when:
    - the `intersect` method returns `true` and- the calculations to determine whether or not the
        `Shape` entirely contains the rectangular area are
        prohibitively expensive.This means that for some `Shapes` this method might
    return `false` even though the `Shape` contains
    the rectangular area.
    The [`Area`](Area.md "class in java.awt.geom") class performs
    more accurate geometric computations than most
    `Shape` objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
    answer is required.

    This method object may conservatively return false in

    public final boolean intersects(double x,

    Tests if the interior of the `Shape` intersects the

    The rectangular area is considered to intersect the `Shape`
    if any point is contained in both the interior of the

    public final [PathIterator](PathIterator.md "interface in java.awt.geom") getPathIterator([AffineTransform](AffineTransform.md "class in java.awt.geom") at,
    double flatness)

    Returns an iterator object that iterates along the `Shape`
    boundary and provides access to a flattened view of the
    `Shape` outline geometry.

    Only SEG\_MOVETO, SEG\_LINETO, and SEG\_CLOSE point types are
    returned by the iterator.

    If an optional `AffineTransform` is specified,
    the coordinates returned in the iteration are transformed
    accordingly.

    The amount of subdivision of the curved segments is controlled
    by the `flatness` parameter, which specifies the
    maximum distance that any point on the unflattened transformed
    curve can deviate from the returned flattened path segments.
    Note that a limit on the accuracy of the flattened path might be
    silently imposed, causing very small flattening parameters to be
    treated as larger values. This limit, if there is one, is
    defined by the particular implementation that is used.

    Each call to this method returns a fresh `PathIterator`
    object that traverses the `Shape` object geometry
    independently from any other `PathIterator` objects in use at
    the same time.

    It is recommended, but not guaranteed, that objects
    implementing the `Shape` interface isolate iterations
    that are in process from any changes that might occur to the original
    object's geometry during such iterations.

    The iterator for this class is not multi-threaded safe,
    which means that this `Path2D` class does not
    guarantee that modifications to the geometry of this
    `Path2D` object do not affect any iterations of
    that geometry that are already in process.

    Specified by:
    :   `getPathIterator` in interface `Shape`

    Parameters:
    :   `at` - an optional `AffineTransform` to be applied to the
        coordinates as they are returned in the iteration, or
        `null` if untransformed coordinates are desired
    :   `flatness` - the maximum distance that the line segments used to
        approximate the curved segments are allowed to deviate
        from any point on the original curve

    Returns:
    :   a new `PathIterator` that independently traverses
        a flattened view of the geometry of the `Shape`.
