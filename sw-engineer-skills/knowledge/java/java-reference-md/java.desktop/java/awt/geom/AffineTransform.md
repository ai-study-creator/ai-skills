---

public class AffineTransform
extends [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Cloneable](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Cloneable.md "interface in java.lang"), [Serializable](../../../../java.base/java/io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io")

The `AffineTransform` class represents a 2D affine transform
that performs a linear mapping from 2D coordinates to other 2D
coordinates that preserves the "straightness" and
"parallelness" of lines. Affine transformations can be constructed
using sequences of translations, scales, flips, rotations, and shears.

Such a coordinate transformation can be represented by a 3 row by
3 column matrix with an implied last row of [ 0 0 1 ]. This matrix
transforms source coordinates `(x,y)` into
destination coordinates `(x',y')` by considering
them to be a column vector and multiplying the coordinate vector
by the matrix according to the following process:

```
      [ x']   [  m00  m01  m02  ] [ x ]   [ m00x + m01y + m02 ]
      [ y'] = [  m10  m11  m12  ] [ y ] = [ m10x + m11y + m12 ]
      [ 1 ]   [   0    0    1   ] [ 1 ]   [         1         ]
```

## Handling 90-Degree Rotations

In some variations of the `rotate` methods in the
`AffineTransform` class, a double-precision argument
specifies the angle of rotation in radians.
These methods have special handling for rotations of approximately
90 degrees (including multiples such as 180, 270, and 360 degrees),
so that the common case of quadrant rotation is handled more
efficiently.
This special handling can cause angles very close to multiples of
90 degrees to be treated as if they were exact multiples of
90 degrees.
For small multiples of 90 degrees the range of angles treated
as a quadrant rotation is approximately 0.00000121 degrees wide.
This section explains why such special care is needed and how
it is implemented.

Since 90 degrees is represented as `PI/2` in radians,
and since PI is a transcendental (and therefore irrational) number,
it is not possible to exactly represent a multiple of 90 degrees as
an exact double precision value measured in radians.
As a result it is theoretically impossible to describe quadrant
rotations (90, 180, 270 or 360 degrees) using these values.
Double precision floating point values can get very close to
non-zero multiples of `PI/2` but never close enough
for the sine or cosine to be exactly 0.0, 1.0 or -1.0.
The implementations of `Math.sin()` and
`Math.cos()` correspondingly never return 0.0
for any case other than `Math.sin(0.0)`.
These same implementations do, however, return exactly 1.0 and
-1.0 for some range of numbers around each multiple of 90
degrees since the correct answer is so close to 1.0 or -1.0 that
the double precision significand cannot represent the difference
as accurately as it can for numbers that are near 0.0.

The net result of these issues is that if the
`Math.sin()` and `Math.cos()` methods
are used to directly generate the values for the matrix modifications
during these radian-based rotation operations then the resulting
transform is never strictly classifiable as a quadrant rotation
even for a simple case like `rotate(Math.PI/2.0)`,
due to minor variations in the matrix caused by the non-0.0 values
obtained for the sine and cosine.
If these transforms are not classified as quadrant rotations then
subsequent code which attempts to optimize further operations based
upon the type of the transform will be relegated to its most general
implementation.

Because quadrant rotations are fairly common,
this class should handle these cases reasonably quickly, both in
applying the rotations to the transform and in applying the resulting
transform to the coordinates.
To facilitate this optimal handling, the methods which take an angle
of rotation measured in radians attempt to detect angles that are
intended to be quadrant rotations and treat them as such.
These methods therefore treat an angle *theta* as a quadrant
rotation if either `Math.sin(theta)` or
`Math.cos(theta)` returns exactly 1.0 or -1.0.
As a rule of thumb, this property holds true for a range of
approximately 0.0000000211 radians (or 0.00000121 degrees) around
small multiples of `Math.PI/2.0`.

        apply to this transform

  + ### getDeterminant

    public double getDeterminant()

    Returns the determinant of the matrix representation of the transform.
    The determinant is useful both to determine if the transform can
    be inverted and to get a single value representing the
    combined X and Y scaling of the transform.

    If the determinant is non-zero, then this transform is
    invertible and the various methods that depend on the inverse
    transform do not need to throw a
    [`NoninvertibleTransformException`](NoninvertibleTransformException.md "class in java.awt.geom").
    If the determinant is zero then this transform can not be
    inverted since the transform maps all input coordinates onto
    a line or a point.
    If the determinant is near enough to zero then inverse transform
    operations might not carry enough precision to produce meaningful
    results.

    If this transform represents a uniform scale, as indicated by
    the `getType` method then the determinant also
    represents the square of the uniform scale factor by which all of
    the points are expanded from or contracted towards the origin.
    If this transform represents a non-uniform scale or more general
    transform then the determinant is not likely to represent a
    value useful for any purpose other than determining if inverse
    transforms are possible.

    Mathematically, the determinant is calculated using the formula:

    ```
              |  m00  m01  m02  |
              |  m10  m11  m12  |  =  m00 * m11 - m01 * m10
              |   0    0    1   |
    ```

    Returns:
    :   the determinant of the matrix used to transform the
        coordinates.

  + ### getMatrix

    public void getMatrix(double[] flatmatrix)

    Retrieves the 6 specifiable values in the 3x3 affine transformation
    matrix and places them into an array of double precisions values.
    The values are stored in the array as
    { m00 m10 m01 m11 m02 m12 }.
    An array of 4 doubles can also be specified, in which case only the
    first four elements representing the non-transform
    parts of the array are retrieved and the values are stored into
    the array as { m00 m10 m01 m11 }

    Returns the `m00` element of the 3x3 affine transformation matrix.

    way to provide a new user space
    that is mapped to the former user space by `Tx`.
    Cx is updated to perform the combined transformation.
    Transforming a point p by the updated transform Cx' is
    equivalent to first transforming p by `Tx` and then
    transforming the result by the original transform Cx like this:
    Cx'(p) = Cx(Tx(p))
    In matrix notation, if this transform Cx is
    represented by the matrix [this] and `Tx` is represented

    in a less commonly used way such that `Tx` modifies the
    coordinate transformation relative to the absolute pixel
    space rather than relative to the existing user space.
    Cx is updated to perform the combined transformation.
    Transforming a point p by the updated transform Cx' is
    equivalent to first transforming p by the original transform
    Cx and then transforming the result by
    `Tx` like this:
    Cx'(p) = Tx(Cx(p))
    In matrix notation, if this transform Cx
    is represented by the matrix [this] and `Tx` is
    represented by the matrix [Tx] then this method does the

    The inverse transform Tx' of this transform Tx
    maps coordinates transformed by Tx back
    to their original coordinates.
    In other words, Tx'(Tx(p)) = p = Tx(Tx'(p)).

    If this transform maps all coordinates onto a point or a line
    then it will not have an inverse, since coordinates that do
    not lie on the destination point or line will not have an inverse
    mapping.
    The `getDeterminant` method can be used to determine if this
    transform has no inverse, in which case an exception will be
    thrown if the `createInverse` method is called.

    Returns:
    :   a new `AffineTransform` object representing the
        inverse transformation.

    Throws:

    The inverse transform Tx' of this transform Tx
    maps coordinates transformed by Tx back
    to their original coordinates.
    In other words, Tx'(Tx(p)) = p = Tx(Tx'(p)).

    If this transform maps all coordinates onto a point or a line
    then it will not have an inverse, since coordinates that do
    not lie on the destination point or line will not have an inverse
    mapping.
    The `getDeterminant` method can be used to determine if this
    transform has no inverse, in which case an exception will be
    thrown if the `invert` method is called.

    public [Point2D](Point2D.md "class in java.awt.geom") transform([Point2D](Point2D.md "class in java.awt.geom") ptSrc,
    [Point2D](Point2D.md "class in java.awt.geom") ptDst)

    Transforms the specified `ptSrc` and stores the result
    in `ptDst`.
    If `ptDst` is `null`, a new [`Point2D`](Point2D.md "class in java.awt.geom")
    object is allocated and then the result of the transformation is
    stored in this object.
    In either case, `ptDst`, which contains the
    transformed point, is returned for convenience.
    If `ptSrc` and `ptDst` are the same
    object, the input point is correctly overwritten with
    the transformed point.

    Parameters:
    :   `ptSrc` - the specified `Point2D` to be transformed
    :   `ptDst` - the specified `Point2D` that stores the
        result of transforming `ptSrc`

        `ptSrc` and storing the result in `ptDst`.

    [Point2D](Point2D.md "class in java.awt.geom")[] ptDst,
    int dstOff,
    int numPts)

    Transforms an array of point objects by this transform.
    If any element of the `ptDst` array is
    `null`, a new `Point2D` object is allocated
    and stored into that element before storing the results of the
    transformation.

    Note that this method does not take any precautions to
    avoid problems caused by storing results into `Point2D`
    objects that will be used as the source for calculations
    further down the source array.
    This method does guarantee that if a specified `Point2D`
    object is both the source and destination for the same single point
    transform operation then the results will not be stored until
    the calculations are complete to avoid storing the results on
    top of the operands.
    If, however, the destination `Point2D` object for one
    operation is the same object as the source `Point2D`
    object for another operation further down the source array then
    the original coordinates in that point are overwritten before
    they can be converted.

    Parameters:
    :   `ptSrc` - the array containing the source point objects
    :   `srcOff` - the offset to the first point object to be
        transformed in the source array
    :   `ptDst` - the array into which the transform point objects are
        returned
    :   `dstOff` - the offset to the location of the first

    A relative distance vector is transformed without applying the
    translation components of the affine transformation matrix
    using the following equations:

    ```
      [  x' ]   [  m00  m01 (m02) ] [  x  ]   [ m00x + m01y ]
      [  y' ] = [  m10  m11 (m12) ] [  y  ] = [ m10x + m11y ]
