java.awt.geom.Area

All Implemented Interfaces:
:   `Shape`, `Cloneable`

---

public class Area
extends [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Shape](../Shape.md "interface in java.awt"), [Cloneable](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Cloneable.md "interface in java.lang")

An `Area` object stores and manipulates a
resolution-independent description of an enclosed area of
2-dimensional space.
`Area` objects can be transformed and can perform
various Constructive Area Geometry (CAG) operations when combined
with other `Area` objects.
The CAG operations include area
[`addition`](#add(java.awt.geom.Area)), [`subtraction`](#subtract(java.awt.geom.Area)),
[`intersection`](#intersect(java.awt.geom.Area)), and [`exclusive or`](#exclusiveOr(java.awt.geom.Area)).
See the linked method documentation for examples of the various
operations.

The `Area` class implements the `Shape`
interface and provides full support for all of its hit-testing
and path iteration facilities, but an `Area` is more
specific than a generalized path in a number of ways:

* Only closed paths and sub-paths are stored.
  `Area` objects constructed from unclosed paths
  are implicitly closed during construction as if those paths
  had been filled by the `Graphics2D.fill` method.* The interiors of the individual stored sub-paths are all
    non-empty and non-overlapping. Paths are decomposed during
    construction into separate component non-overlapping parts,
    empty pieces of the path are discarded, and then these
    non-empty and non-overlapping properties are maintained
    through all subsequent CAG operations. Outlines of different
    component sub-paths may touch each other, as long as they
    do not cross so that their enclosed areas overlap.* The geometry of the path describing the outline of the
      `Area` resembles the path from which it was
      constructed only in that it describes the same enclosed
      2-dimensional area, but may use entirely different types
      and ordering of the path segments to do so.

Interesting issues which are not always obvious when using
the `Area` include:

* Creating an `Area` from an unclosed (open)
  `Shape` results in a closed outline in the
  `Area` object.* Creating an `Area` from a `Shape`
    which encloses no area (even when "closed") produces an
    empty `Area`. A common example of this issue
    is that producing an `Area` from a line will
    be empty since the line encloses no area. An empty
    `Area` will iterate no geometry in its
    `PathIterator` objects.* A self-intersecting `Shape` may be split into
      two (or more) sub-paths each enclosing one of the
      non-intersecting portions of the original path.* An `Area` may take more path segments to
        describe the same geometry even when the original
        outline is simple and obvious. The analysis that the
        `Area` class must perform on the path may
        not reflect the same concepts of "simple and obvious"
        as a human being perceives.

    public boolean isEmpty()

    Tests whether this `Area` object encloses any area.

        otherwise.

    Since:
    :   1.2
  + ### isSingular

    public boolean isSingular()

    Tests whether this `Area` is comprised of a single
    closed subpath. This method returns `true` if the
    path contains 0 or 1 subpaths, or `false` if the path
    contains more than 1 subpath. The subpaths are counted by the
    number of [`SEG_MOVETO`](PathIterator.md#SEG_MOVETO) segments
    that appear in the path.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the `Area` is comprised
        of a single basic geometry; `false` otherwise.

    public [Rectangle2D](Rectangle2D.md "class in java.awt.geom") getBounds2D()

    Returns a high precision bounding [`Rectangle2D`](Rectangle2D.md "class in java.awt.geom") that
    completely encloses this `Area`.

    The Area class will attempt to return the tightest bounding
    box possible for the Shape. The bounding box will not be
    padded to include the control points of curves in the outline
    of the Shape, but should tightly fit the actual geometry of
    the outline itself.

    box possible for the Shape. The bounding box will not be
    padded to include the control points of curves in the outline
    of the Shape, but should tightly fit the actual geometry of
    the outline itself. Since the returned object represents
    the bounding box with integers, the bounding box can only be
    as tight as the nearest integer coordinates that encompass
    the geometry of the Shape.

    Specified by:
    :   `getBounds` in interface `Shape`

    Returns:

    Transforms the geometry of this `Area` using the specified
    [`AffineTransform`](AffineTransform.md "class in java.awt.geom"). The geometry is transformed in place, which
    permanently changes the enclosed area defined by this object.

    Parameters:
    :   `t` - the transformation used to transform the area

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `t` is null

    Since:

    public [Area](Area.md "class in java.awt.geom") createTransformedArea([AffineTransform](AffineTransform.md "class in java.awt.geom") t)

    Creates a new `Area` object that contains the same
    geometry as this `Area` transformed by the specified

        the new `Area`

    Returns:
    :   a new `Area` object representing the transformed
        geometry.

    Specified by:
    :   `contains` in interface `Shape`

    Parameters:
    :   `x` - the specified X coordinate to be tested
    :   `y` - the specified Y coordinate to be tested

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the specified coordinates are inside
        the `Shape` boundary; `false`
        otherwise.

    Since:
    :   1.2
  + ### contains

    public boolean contains([Point2D](Point2D.md "class in java.awt.geom") p)

    Tests if a specified [`Point2D`](Point2D.md "class in java.awt.geom") is inside the boundary
    of the `Shape`, as described by the
    [definition of insideness](../../../../java.desktop/java/awt/Shape.md#def_insideness).

    Specified by:
    :   `contains` in interface `Shape`

    Parameters:
    :   `p` - the specified `Point2D` to be tested

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the specified `Point2D` is
        inside the boundary of the `Shape`;
        `false` otherwise.

    :   1.2
  + ### contains

    public boolean contains(double x,
    double y,
    double w,
    double h)

    Tests if the interior of the `Shape` entirely contains
    the specified rectangular area. All coordinates that lie inside
    the rectangular area must lie within the `Shape` for the
    entire rectangular area to be considered contained within the
    `Shape`.

    The `Shape.contains()` method allows a `Shape`
    implementation to conservatively return `false` when:
    - the `intersect` method returns `true` and- the calculations to determine whether or not the
        `Shape` entirely contains the rectangular area are
        prohibitively expensive.This means that for some `Shapes` this method might
    return `false` even though the `Shape` contains
    the rectangular area.
    The [`Area`](Area.md "class in java.awt.geom") class performs
    more accurate geometric computations than most
    `Shape` objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
    answer is required.

    Specified by:
    :   `contains` in interface `Shape`

    Parameters:
    :   `x` - the X coordinate of the upper-left corner
        of the specified rectangular area
    :   `y` - the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
        of the specified rectangular area
    :   `w` - the width of the specified rectangular area
    :   `h` - the height of the specified rectangular area

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the interior of the `Shape`
        entirely contains the specified rectangular area;
        `false` otherwise or, if the `Shape`
        contains the rectangular area and the
        `intersects` method returns `true`
        and the containment calculations would be too expensive to
        perform.

    Tests if the interior of the `Shape` entirely contains the
    specified `Rectangle2D`.
    The `Shape.contains()` method allows a `Shape`
    implementation to conservatively return `false` when:
    - the `intersect` method returns `true` and- the calculations to determine whether or not the
        `Shape` entirely contains the `Rectangle2D`
        are prohibitively expensive.This means that for some `Shapes` this method might
    return `false` even though the `Shape` contains
    the `Rectangle2D`.
    The [`Area`](Area.md "class in java.awt.geom") class performs
    more accurate geometric computations than most
    `Shape` objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
    answer is required.

    Specified by:
    :   `contains` in interface `Shape`

    Parameters:
    :   `r` - The specified `Rectangle2D`

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the interior of the `Shape`
        entirely contains the `Rectangle2D`;
        `false` otherwise or, if the `Shape`
        contains the `Rectangle2D` and the
        `intersects` method returns `true`
        and the containment calculations would be too expensive to
        perform.

  + ### intersects

    public boolean intersects(double x,
    double y,
    double w,
    double h)

    Tests if the interior of the `Shape` intersects the
    interior of a specified rectangular area.
    The rectangular area is considered to intersect the `Shape`
    if any point is contained in both the interior of the
    `Shape` and the specified rectangular area.

    The `Shape.intersects()` method allows a `Shape`
    implementation to conservatively return `true` when:
    - there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the
      `Shape` intersect, but- the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
        are prohibitively expensive.This means that for some `Shapes` this method might
    return `true` even though the rectangular area does not
    intersect the `Shape`.
    The [`Area`](Area.md "class in java.awt.geom") class performs
    more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most
    `Shape` objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
    answer is required.

    Specified by:
    :   `intersects` in interface `Shape`

    Parameters:
    :   `x` - the X coordinate of the upper-left corner
        of the specified rectangular area
    :   `y` - the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner
        of the specified rectangular area
    :   `w` - the width of the specified rectangular area
    :   `h` - the height of the specified rectangular area

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the interior of the `Shape` and
        the interior of the rectangular area intersect, or are
        both highly likely to intersect and intersection calculations
        would be too expensive to perform; `false` otherwise.

    public boolean intersects([Rectangle2D](Rectangle2D.md "class in java.awt.geom") r)

    Tests if the interior of the `Shape` intersects the
    interior of a specified `Rectangle2D`.
    The `Shape.intersects()` method allows a `Shape`
    implementation to conservatively return `true` when:
    - there is a high probability that the `Rectangle2D` and the
      `Shape` intersect, but- the calculations to accurately determine this intersection
        are prohibitively expensive.This means that for some `Shapes` this method might

    `Shape` objects and therefore can be used if a more precise
    answer is required.

    Specified by:
    :   `intersects` in interface `Shape`

    Parameters:
    :   `r` - the specified `Rectangle2D`

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the interior of the `Shape` and
        the interior of the specified `Rectangle2D`
        intersect, or are both highly likely to intersect and intersection
        calculations would be too expensive to perform; `false`
        otherwise.

  + ### getPathIterator

    public [PathIterator](PathIterator.md "interface in java.awt.geom") getPathIterator([AffineTransform](AffineTransform.md "class in java.awt.geom") at)

    Creates a [`PathIterator`](PathIterator.md "interface in java.awt.geom") for the outline of this
    `Area` object. This `Area` object is unchanged.

    Specified by:
    :   `getPathIterator` in interface `Shape`

    Parameters:
    :   `at` - an optional `AffineTransform` to be applied to
        the coordinates as they are returned in the iteration, or
        `null` if untransformed coordinates are desired

    Returns:
    :   the `PathIterator` object that returns the
        geometry of the outline of this `Area`, one
        segment at a time.

    public [PathIterator](PathIterator.md "interface in java.awt.geom") getPathIterator([AffineTransform](AffineTransform.md "class in java.awt.geom") at,
    double flatness)

    Creates a `PathIterator` for the flattened outline of
    this `Area` object. Only uncurved path segments
    represented by the SEG\_MOVETO, SEG\_LINETO, and SEG\_CLOSE point
    types are returned by the iterator. This `Area`
    object is unchanged.

    Specified by:
    :   `getPathIterator` in interface `Shape`

    Parameters:

        applied to the coordinates as they are returned in the
        iteration, or `null` if untransformed coordinates
        are desired
    :   `flatness` - the maximum amount that the control points
        for a given curve can vary from colinear before a subdivided
        curve is replaced by a straight line connecting the end points

    Returns:
    :   the `PathIterator` object that returns the
        geometry of the outline of this `Area`, one segment
        at a time.
