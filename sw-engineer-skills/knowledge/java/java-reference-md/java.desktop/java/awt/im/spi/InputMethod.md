# Interface InputMethod

---

public interface InputMethod

Defines the interface for an input method that supports complex text input.
Input methods traditionally support text input for languages that have
more characters than can be represented on a standard-size keyboard,
such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. However, they may also be used to
support phonetic text input for English or character reordering for Thai.

Subclasses of InputMethod can be loaded by the input method framework; they
can then be selected either through the API
([`InputContext.selectInputMethod`](../InputContext.md#selectInputMethod(java.util.Locale)))
or the user interface (the input method selection menu).

* ## Method Details

  + ### setInputMethodContext

    void setInputMethodContext([InputMethodContext](InputMethodContext.md "interface in java.awt.im.spi") context)

    Sets the input method context, which is used to dispatch input method
    events to the client component and to request information from
    the client component.

    This method is called once immediately after instantiating this input
    method.

    Parameters:
    :   `context` - the input method context for this input method

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `context` is null
  + ### setLocale

    boolean setLocale([Locale](../../../../../java.base/java/util/Locale.md "class in java.util") locale)

    Attempts to set the input locale. If the input method supports the
    desired locale, it changes its behavior to support input for the locale
    and returns true.
    Otherwise, it returns false and does not change its behavior.

    This method is called
    - by [`InputContext.selectInputMethod`](../InputContext.md#selectInputMethod(java.util.Locale)),- when switching to this input method through the user interface if the user
        specified a locale or if the previously selected input method's
        [`getLocale`](#getLocale()) method
        returns a non-null value.

    Parameters:
    :   `locale` - locale to input

    Returns:
    :   whether the specified locale is supported

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `locale` is null
  + ### getLocale

    [Locale](../../../../../java.base/java/util/Locale.md "class in java.util") getLocale()

    Returns the current input locale. Might return null in exceptional cases.

    This method is called
    - by [`InputContext.getLocale`](../InputContext.md#getLocale()) and- when switching from this input method to a different one through the
        user interface.

    Returns:
    :   the current input locale, or null
  + ### setCharacterSubsets

    void setCharacterSubsets([Character.Subset](../../../../../java.base/java/lang/Character.Subset.md "class in java.lang")[] subsets)

    Sets the subsets of the Unicode character set that this input method
    is allowed to input. Null may be passed in to indicate that all
    characters are allowed.

    This method is called
    - immediately after instantiating this input method,- when switching to this input method from a different one, and- by [`InputContext.setCharacterSubsets`](../InputContext.md#setCharacterSubsets(java.lang.Character.Subset%5B%5D)).

    Parameters:
    :   `subsets` - the subsets of the Unicode character set from which
        characters may be input
  + ### setCompositionEnabled

    void setCompositionEnabled(boolean enable)

    Enables or disables this input method for composition,
    depending on the value of the parameter `enable`.

    An input method that is enabled for composition interprets incoming
    events for both composition and control purposes, while a
    disabled input method does not interpret events for composition.
    Note however that events are passed on to the input method regardless
    whether it is enabled or not, and that an input method that is disabled
    for composition may still interpret events for control purposes,
    including to enable or disable itself for composition.

    For input methods provided by host operating systems, it is not always possible to
    determine whether this operation is supported. For example, an input method may enable
    composition only for some locales, and do nothing for other locales. For such input
    methods, it is possible that this method does not throw
    [`UnsupportedOperationException`](../../../../../java.base/java/lang/UnsupportedOperationException.md "class in java.lang"),
    but also does not affect whether composition is enabled.

    This method is called
    - by [`InputContext.setCompositionEnabled`](../InputContext.md#setCompositionEnabled(boolean)),- when switching to this input method from a different one using the
        user interface or
        [`InputContext.selectInputMethod`](../InputContext.md#selectInputMethod(java.util.Locale)),
        if the previously selected input method's
        [`isCompositionEnabled`](#isCompositionEnabled())
        method returns without throwing an exception.

    Parameters:
    :   `enable` - whether to enable the input method for composition

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if this input method does not
        support the enabling/disabling operation

    See Also:
    :   - [`isCompositionEnabled()`](#isCompositionEnabled())
  + ### isCompositionEnabled

    boolean isCompositionEnabled()

    Determines whether this input method is enabled.
    An input method that is enabled for composition interprets incoming
    events for both composition and control purposes, while a
    disabled input method does not interpret events for composition.

    This method is called
    - by [`InputContext.isCompositionEnabled`](../InputContext.md#isCompositionEnabled()) and- when switching from this input method to a different one using the
        user interface or
        [`InputContext.selectInputMethod`](../InputContext.md#selectInputMethod(java.util.Locale)).

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this input method is enabled for
        composition; `false` otherwise.

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if this input method does not
        support checking whether it is enabled for composition

    See Also:
    :   - [`setCompositionEnabled(boolean)`](#setCompositionEnabled(boolean))
  + ### reconvert

    void reconvert()

    Starts the reconversion operation. The input method obtains the
    text to be reconverted from the current client component using the
    [`InputMethodRequests.getSelectedText`](../InputMethodRequests.md#getSelectedText(java.text.AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute%5B%5D))
    method. It can use other `InputMethodRequests`
    methods to request additional information required for the
    reconversion operation. The composed and committed text
    produced by the operation is sent to the client component as a
    sequence of `InputMethodEvent`s. If the given text
    cannot be reconverted, the same text should be sent to the
    client component as committed text.

    This method is called by
    [`InputContext.reconvert`](../InputContext.md#reconvert()).

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the input method does not
        support the reconversion operation.
  + ### dispatchEvent

    void dispatchEvent([AWTEvent](../../AWTEvent.md "class in java.awt") event)

    Dispatches the event to the input method. If input method support is
    enabled for the focused component, incoming events of certain types
    are dispatched to the current input method for this component before
    they are dispatched to the component's methods or event listeners.
    The input method decides whether it needs to handle the event. If it
    does, it also calls the event's `consume` method; this
    causes the event to not get dispatched to the component's event
    processing methods or event listeners.

    Events are dispatched if they are instances of InputEvent or its
    subclasses.
    This includes instances of the AWT classes KeyEvent and MouseEvent.

    This method is called by [`InputContext.dispatchEvent`](../InputContext.md#dispatchEvent(java.awt.AWTEvent)).

    Parameters:
    :   `event` - the event being dispatched to the input method

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `event` is null
  + ### notifyClientWindowChange

    void notifyClientWindowChange([Rectangle](../../Rectangle.md "class in java.awt") bounds)

    Notifies this input method of changes in the client window
    location or state. This method is called while this input
    method is the current input method of its input context and
    notifications for it are enabled (see [`InputMethodContext.enableClientWindowNotification`](InputMethodContext.md#enableClientWindowNotification(java.awt.im.spi.InputMethod,boolean))). Calls
    to this method are temporarily suspended if the input context's
    [`removeNotify`](../InputContext.md#removeNotify(java.awt.Component))
    method is called, and resume when the input method is activated
    for a new client component. It is called in the following
    situations:
    - when the window containing the current client component changes
      in location, size, visibility, iconification state, or when the
      window is closed.
    - from `enableClientWindowNotification(inputMethod, true)`
      if the current client component exists,
    - when activating the input method for the first time after it
      called
      `enableClientWindowNotification(inputMethod, true)`
      if during the call no current client component was
      available,
    - when activating the input method for a new client component
      after the input context's removeNotify method has been
      called.

    Parameters:
    :   `bounds` - client window's [`bounds`](../../Component.md#getBounds()) on the screen; or null if
        the client window is iconified or invisible
  + ### activate

    void activate()

    Activates the input method for immediate input processing.

    If an input method provides its own windows, it should make sure
    at this point that all necessary windows are open and visible.

    This method is called
    - by [`InputContext.dispatchEvent`](../InputContext.md#dispatchEvent(java.awt.AWTEvent))
      when a client component receives a FOCUS\_GAINED event,- when switching to this input method from a different one using the
        user interface or
        [`InputContext.selectInputMethod`](../InputContext.md#selectInputMethod(java.util.Locale)).The method is only called when the input method is inactive.
    A newly instantiated input method is assumed to be inactive.
  + ### deactivate

    void deactivate(boolean isTemporary)

    Deactivates the input method.
    The isTemporary argument has the same meaning as in
    [`FocusEvent.isTemporary`](../../event/FocusEvent.md#isTemporary()).

    If an input method provides its own windows, only windows that relate
    to the current composition (such as a lookup choice window) should be
    closed at this point.
    It is possible that the input method will be immediately activated again
    for a different client component, and closing and reopening more
    persistent windows (such as a control panel) would create unnecessary
    screen flicker.
    Before an instance of a different input method class is activated,
    [`hideWindows()`](#hideWindows()) is called on the current input method.

    This method is called
    - by [`InputContext.dispatchEvent`](../InputContext.md#dispatchEvent(java.awt.AWTEvent))
      when a client component receives a FOCUS\_LOST event,- when switching from this input method to a different one using the
        user interface or
        [`InputContext.selectInputMethod`](../InputContext.md#selectInputMethod(java.util.Locale)),- before [`removeNotify`](#removeNotify()) if the current client component is
          removed.The method is only called when the input method is active.

    Parameters:
    :   `isTemporary` - whether the focus change is temporary
  + ### hideWindows

    void hideWindows()

    Closes or hides all windows opened by this input method instance or
    its class.

    This method is called
    - before calling [`activate`](#activate()) on an instance of a different input
      method class,- before calling [`dispose`](#dispose()) on this input method.The method is only called when the input method is inactive.
  + ### removeNotify

    void removeNotify()

    Notifies the input method that a client component has been
    removed from its containment hierarchy, or that input method
    support has been disabled for the component.

    This method is called by [`InputContext.removeNotify`](../InputContext.md#removeNotify(java.awt.Component)).

    The method is only called when the input method is inactive.
  + ### endComposition

    void endComposition()

    Ends any input composition that may currently be going on in this
    context. Depending on the platform and possibly user preferences,
    this may commit or delete uncommitted text. Any changes to the text
    are communicated to the active component using an input method event.

    A text editing component may call this in a variety of situations,
    for example, when the user moves the insertion point within the text
    (but outside the composed text), or when the component's text is
    saved to a file or copied to the clipboard.

    This method is called
    - by [`InputContext.endComposition`](../InputContext.md#endComposition()),- by [`InputContext.dispatchEvent`](../InputContext.md#dispatchEvent(java.awt.AWTEvent))
        when switching to a different client component- when switching from this input method to a different one using the
          user interface or
          [`InputContext.selectInputMethod`](../InputContext.md#selectInputMethod(java.util.Locale)).
  + ### dispose

    void dispose()

    Releases the resources used by this input method.
    In particular, the input method should dispose windows and close files that are no
    longer needed.

    This method is called by [`InputContext.dispose`](../InputContext.md#dispose()).

    The method is only called when the input method is inactive.
    No method of this interface is called on this instance after dispose.
  + ### getControlObject

    [Object](../../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") getControlObject()

    Returns a control object from this input method, or null. A
    control object provides methods that control the behavior of the
    input method or obtain information from the input method. The type
    of the object is an input method specific class. Clients have to
    compare the result against known input method control object
    classes and cast to the appropriate class to invoke the methods
    provided.

    This method is called by
    [`InputContext.getInputMethodControlObject`](../InputContext.md#getInputMethodControlObject()).

    Returns:
    :   a control object from this input method, or null
