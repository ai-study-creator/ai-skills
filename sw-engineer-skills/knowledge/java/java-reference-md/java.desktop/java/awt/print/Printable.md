# Interface Printable

---

public interface Printable

The `Printable` interface is implemented
by the `print` methods of the current
page painter, which is called by the printing
system to render a page. When building a
[`Pageable`](Pageable.md "interface in java.awt.print"), pairs of [`PageFormat`](PageFormat.md "class in java.awt.print")
instances and instances that implement
this interface are used to describe each page. The
instance implementing `Printable` is called to
print the page's graphics.

A `Printable(..)` may be set on a `PrinterJob`.
When the client subsequently initiates printing by calling
`PrinterJob.print(..)` control

is handed to the printing system until all pages have been printed.
It does this by calling `Printable.print(..)` until
all pages in the document have been printed.
In using the `Printable` interface the printing
commits to image the contents of a page whenever
requested by the printing system.

The parameters to `Printable.print(..)` include a
`PageFormat` which describes the printable area of
the page, needed for calculating the contents that will fit the
page, and the page index, which specifies the zero-based print
stream index of the requested page.

For correct printing behaviour, the following points should be
observed:

* The printing system may request a page index more than once.
  On each occasion equal PageFormat parameters will be supplied.* The printing system will call `Printable.print(..)`
    with page indexes which increase monotonically, although as noted above,
    the `Printable` should expect multiple calls for a page index
    and that page indexes may be skipped, when page ranges are specified
    by the client, or by a user through a print dialog.* If multiple collated copies of a document are requested, and the
      printer cannot natively support this, then the document may be imaged
      multiple times. Printing will start each copy from the lowest print
      stream page index page.* With the exception of re-imaging an entire document for multiple
        collated copies, the increasing page index order means that when
        page N is requested if a client needs to calculate page break position,
        it may safely discard any state related to pages < N, and make current
        that for page N. "State" usually is just the calculated position in the
        document that corresponds to the start of the page.* When called by the printing system the `Printable` must
          inspect and honour the supplied PageFormat parameter as well as the
          page index. The format of the page to be drawn is specified by the
          supplied PageFormat. The size, orientation and imageable area of the page
          is therefore already determined and rendering must be within this
          imageable area.
          This is key to correct printing behaviour, and it has the
          implication that the client has the responsibility of tracking
          what content belongs on the specified page.* When the `Printable` is obtained from a client-supplied
            `Pageable` then the client may provide different PageFormats
            for each page index. Calculations of page breaks must account for this.

  + ### print

    int print([Graphics](../Graphics.md "class in java.awt") graphics,
    [PageFormat](PageFormat.md "class in java.awt.print") pageFormat,
    int pageIndex)
    throws [PrinterException](PrinterException.md "class in java.awt.print")

    Prints the page at the specified index into the specified
    [`Graphics`](../Graphics.md "class in java.awt") context in the specified
    format. A `PrinterJob` calls the
    `Printable` interface to request that a page be
    rendered into the context specified by
    `graphics`. The format of the page to be drawn is
    specified by `pageFormat`. The zero based index
    of the requested page is specified by `pageIndex`.
    If the requested page does not exist then this method returns
    NO\_SUCH\_PAGE; otherwise PAGE\_EXISTS is returned.
    The `Graphics` class or subclass implements the
    [`PrinterGraphics`](PrinterGraphics.md "interface in java.awt.print") interface to provide additional
    information. If the `Printable` object
    aborts the print job then it throws a [`PrinterException`](PrinterException.md "class in java.awt.print").

    Parameters:
    :   `graphics` - the context into which the page is drawn
    :   `pageFormat` - the size and orientation of the page being drawn
    :   `pageIndex` - the zero based index of the page to be drawn

    Returns:
    :   PAGE\_EXISTS if the page is rendered successfully
        or NO\_SUCH\_PAGE if `pageIndex` specifies a
        non-existent page.

    Throws:
    :   `PrinterException` - thrown when the print job is terminated.
