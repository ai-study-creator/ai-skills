    Gets a property of this image by name.

    Individual property names are defined by the various image
    formats. If a property is not defined for a particular image, this
    method returns the `UndefinedProperty` object.

    If the properties for this image are not yet known, this method
    returns `null`, and the `ImageObserver`
    object is notified later.

    The property name `"comment"` should be used to store
    an optional comment which can be presented to the application as a
    description of the image, its source, or its author.

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - a property name.
    :   `observer` - an object waiting for this image to be loaded.

    Returns:
    :   the value of the named property.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the property name is null.

  + ### getScaledInstance

    public [Image](Image.md "class in java.awt") getScaledInstance(int width,
    int height,
    int hints)

    Creates a scaled version of this image.
    A new `Image` object is returned which will render
    the image at the specified `width` and
    `height` by default. The new `Image` object
    may be loaded asynchronously even if the original source image
    has already been loaded completely.

    If either `width`
    or `height` is a negative number then a value is
    substituted to maintain the aspect ratio of the original image
    dimensions. If both `width` and `height`
    are negative, then the original image dimensions are used.

    Parameters:
    :   `width` - the width to which to scale the image.
    :   `height` - the height to which to scale the image.
    :   `hints` - flags to indicate the type of algorithm to use
        for image resampling.

    Returns:
    :   a scaled version of the image.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `width`
        or `height` is zero.

    Since:
    :   1.1

        - [`SCALE_AREA_AVERAGING`](#SCALE_AREA_AVERAGING)
  + ### flush

    public void flush()

    Flushes all reconstructable resources being used by this Image object.
    This includes any pixel data that is being cached for rendering to
    the screen as well as any system resources that are being used
    to store data or pixels for the image if they can be recreated.
    The image is reset to a state similar to when it was first created
    so that if it is again rendered, the image data will have to be
    recreated or fetched again from its source.

    Examples of how this method affects specific types of Image object:
    - BufferedImage objects leave the primary Raster which stores their
      pixels untouched, but flush any information cached about those
      pixels such as copies uploaded to the display hardware for
      accelerated blits.- Image objects created by the Component methods which take a
        width and height leave their primary buffer of pixels untouched,
        but have all cached information released much like is done for
        BufferedImage objects.- VolatileImage objects release all of their pixel resources
          including their primary copy which is typically stored on
          the display hardware where resources are scarce.
          These objects can later be restored using their
          [`validate`](image/VolatileImage.md#validate(java.awt.GraphicsConfiguration))
          method.- Image objects created by the Toolkit and Component classes which are
            loaded from files, URLs or produced by an [`ImageProducer`](image/ImageProducer.md "interface in java.awt.image")
            are unloaded and all local resources are released.
            These objects can later be reloaded from their original source
            as needed when they are rendered, just as when they were first
            created.
  + ### getCapabilities

    public [ImageCapabilities](ImageCapabilities.md "class in java.awt") getCapabilities([GraphicsConfiguration](GraphicsConfiguration.md "class in java.awt") gc)

    Returns an ImageCapabilities object which can be
    inquired as to the capabilities of this
    Image on the specified GraphicsConfiguration.
    This allows programmers to find
    out more runtime information on the specific Image
    object that they have created. For example, the user
    might create a BufferedImage but the system may have
    no video memory left for creating an image of that
    size on the given GraphicsConfiguration, so although the object
    may be acceleratable in general, it
    does not have that capability on this GraphicsConfiguration.

    Parameters:
    :   `gc` - a `GraphicsConfiguration` object. A value of null
        for this parameter will result in getting the image capabilities
        for the default `GraphicsConfiguration`.

    Returns:
    :   an `ImageCapabilities` object that contains
        the capabilities of this `Image` on the specified
        GraphicsConfiguration.

    Since:
    :   1.5

    See Also:
    :   - [`VolatileImage.getCapabilities()`](image/VolatileImage.md#getCapabilities())
  + ### setAccelerationPriority

    public void setAccelerationPriority(float priority)

    Sets a hint for this image about how important acceleration is.
    This priority hint is used to compare to the priorities of other
    Image objects when determining how to use scarce acceleration
    resources such as video memory. When and if it is possible to
    accelerate this Image, if there are not enough resources available
    to provide that acceleration but enough can be freed up by
    de-accelerating some other image of lower priority, then that other
    Image may be de-accelerated in deference to this one. Images
    that have the same priority take up resources on a first-come,
    first-served basis.

    Parameters:
    :   `priority` - a value between 0 and 1, inclusive, where higher
        values indicate more importance for acceleration. A value of 0
        means that this Image should never be accelerated. Other values
        are used simply to determine acceleration priority relative to other
        Images.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `priority` is less
        than zero or greater than 1.

    Since:
    :   1.5
  + ### getAccelerationPriority

    public float getAccelerationPriority()

    Returns the current value of the acceleration priority hint.

    Returns:
    :   value between 0 and 1, inclusive, which represents the current
        priority value

    Since:
    :   1.5
