All Implemented Interfaces:

public class MediaTracker
extends [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Serializable](../../../java.base/java/io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io")

The `MediaTracker` class is a utility class to track
the status of a number of media objects. Media objects could
include audio clips as well as images, though currently only
images are supported.

To use a media tracker, create an instance of
`MediaTracker` and call its `addImage`
method for each image to be tracked. In addition, each image can
be assigned a unique identifier. This identifier controls the
priority order in which the images are fetched. It can also be used
to identify unique subsets of the images that can be waited on
independently. Images with a lower ID are loaded in preference to
those with a higher ID number.

Tracking an animated image
might not always be useful
due to the multi-part nature of animated image
loading and painting,
but it is supported.
`MediaTracker` treats an animated image
as completely loaded
when the first frame is completely loaded.
At that point, the `MediaTracker`
signals any waiters
that the image is completely loaded.
If no `ImageObserver`s are observing the image
when the first frame has finished loading,
the image might flush itself
to conserve resources
(see [`Image.flush()`](Image.md#flush())).

Here is an example of using `MediaTracker`:
