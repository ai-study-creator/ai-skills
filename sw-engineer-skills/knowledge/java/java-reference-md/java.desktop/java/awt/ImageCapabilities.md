  `Object`

  `clone()`

  Creates and returns a copy of this object.

  `boolean`

  `isAccelerated()`

  Returns `true` if the object whose capabilities are
  encapsulated in this `ImageCapabilities` can be or is
  accelerated.

  `boolean`

  `isTrueVolatile()`

  Returns `true` if the `VolatileImage`
  described by this `ImageCapabilities` can lose

  + ### ImageCapabilities

    public ImageCapabilities(boolean accelerated)

    Creates a new object for specifying image capabilities.

    Parameters:
    :   `accelerated` - whether or not an accelerated image is desired
* ## Method Details

  + ### isAccelerated

    public boolean isAccelerated()

    Returns `true` if the object whose capabilities are
    encapsulated in this `ImageCapabilities` can be or is
    accelerated.

    Returns:
    :   whether or not an image can be, or is, accelerated. There are
        various platform-specific ways to accelerate an image, including
        pixmaps, VRAM, AGP. This is the general acceleration method (as
        opposed to residing in system memory).
  + ### isTrueVolatile

    public boolean isTrueVolatile()

    Returns `true` if the `VolatileImage`
    described by this `ImageCapabilities` can lose
    its surfaces.

    Returns:
    :   whether or not a volatile image is subject to losing its surfaces
        at the whim of the operating system.
  + ### clone

    public [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") clone()

    Description copied from class: `Object`

    Creates and returns a copy of this object. The precise meaning
    of "copy" may depend on the class of the object. The general
    intent is that, for any object `x`, the expression:
    > ```
    >  x.clone() != x
    > ```

    will be true, and that the expression:
    > ```
    >  x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()
    > ```

    will be `true`, but these are not absolute requirements.
    While it is typically the case that:
    > ```
    >  x.clone().equals(x)
    > ```

    will be `true`, this is not an absolute requirement.

    By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling
    `super.clone`. If a class and all of its superclasses (except
    `Object`) obey this convention, it will be the case that
    `x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()`.

    By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
    of this object (which is being cloned). To achieve this independence,
    it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned
    by `super.clone` before returning it. Typically, this means
    copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure"
    of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
    objects with references to the copies. If a class contains only
    primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
    the case that no fields in the object returned by `super.clone`
    need to be modified.

    Overrides:
    :   `clone` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a copy of this ImageCapabilities object.
