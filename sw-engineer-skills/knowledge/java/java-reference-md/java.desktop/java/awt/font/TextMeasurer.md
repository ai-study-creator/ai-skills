All Implemented Interfaces:

public final class TextMeasurer
extends [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Cloneable](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Cloneable.md "interface in java.lang")

The `TextMeasurer` class provides the primitive operations
needed for line break: measuring up to a given advance, determining the
advance of a range of characters, and generating a
`TextLayout` for a range of characters. It also provides
methods for incremental editing of paragraphs.

A `TextMeasurer` object is constructed with an
[`AttributedCharacterIterator`](../../../../java.base/java/text/AttributedCharacterIterator.md "interface in java.text")
representing a single paragraph of text. The value returned by the
[`getBeginIndex`](../../../../java.base/java/text/CharacterIterator.md#getBeginIndex())
method of `AttributedCharacterIterator`
defines the absolute index of the first character. The value
returned by the
[`getEndIndex`](../../../../java.base/java/text/CharacterIterator.md#getEndIndex())
method of `AttributedCharacterIterator` defines the index
past the last character. These values define the range of indexes to
use in calls to the `TextMeasurer`. For example, calls to
get the advance of a range of text or the line break of a range of text
must use indexes between the beginning and end index values. Calls to
[`insertChar`](#insertChar(java.text.AttributedCharacterIterator,int))
and
[`deleteChar`](#deleteChar(java.text.AttributedCharacterIterator,int))
reset the `TextMeasurer` to use the beginning index and end
index of the `AttributedCharacterIterator` passed in those calls.

Most clients will use the more convenient `LineBreakMeasurer`,
which implements the standard line break policy (placing as many words
as will fit on each line).

    public TextMeasurer([AttributedCharacterIterator](../../../../java.base/java/text/AttributedCharacterIterator.md "interface in java.text") text,
    [FontRenderContext](FontRenderContext.md "class in java.awt.font") frc)

    Constructs a `TextMeasurer` from the source text.
    The source text should be a single entire paragraph.

    Parameters:
    :   `text` - the source paragraph. Cannot be null.
    :   `frc` - the information about a graphics device which is needed
        to measure the text correctly. Cannot be null.
* ## Method Details

  + ### clone

    protected [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") clone()

    Description copied from class: `Object`

    Creates and returns a copy of this object. The precise meaning
    of "copy" may depend on the class of the object. The general
    intent is that, for any object `x`, the expression:
    > ```
    >  x.clone() != x
    > ```

    will be true, and that the expression:
    > ```
    >  x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()
    > ```

    will be `true`, but these are not absolute requirements.
    While it is typically the case that:
    > ```
    >  x.clone().equals(x)
    > ```

    will be `true`, this is not an absolute requirement.

    By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling
    `super.clone`. If a class and all of its superclasses (except
    `Object`) obey this convention, it will be the case that
    `x.clone().getClass() == x.getClass()`.

    By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
    of this object (which is being cloned). To achieve this independence,
    it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned
    by `super.clone` before returning it. Typically, this means
    copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure"
    of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
    objects with references to the copies. If a class contains only
    primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
    the case that no fields in the object returned by `super.clone`
    need to be modified.

    Overrides:
    :   `clone` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a clone of this instance.

  + ### getLineBreakIndex

    public int getLineBreakIndex(int start,
    float maxAdvance)

    Returns the index of the first character which will not fit on
    on a line beginning at `start` and possible
    measuring up to `maxAdvance` in graphical width.

    Parameters:
    :   `start` - the character index at which to start measuring.
        `start` is an absolute index, not relative to the
        start of the paragraph
    :   `maxAdvance` - the graphical width in which the line must fit

    Returns:
    :   the index after the last character that will fit
        on a line beginning at `start`, which is not longer
        than `maxAdvance` in graphical width

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `start` is
        less than the beginning of the paragraph.
  + ### getAdvanceBetween

    public float getAdvanceBetween(int start,
    int limit)

    Returns the graphical width of a line beginning at `start`
    and including characters up to `limit`.
    `start` and `limit` are absolute indices,
    not relative to the start of the paragraph.

    Parameters:
    :   `start` - the character index at which to start measuring
    :   `limit` - the character index at which to stop measuring

    Returns:
    :   the graphical width of a line beginning at `start`
        and including characters up to `limit`

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if `limit` is less
        than `start`
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `start` or
        `limit` is not between the beginning of
        the paragraph and the end of the paragraph.
  + ### getLayout

    public [TextLayout](TextLayout.md "class in java.awt.font") getLayout(int start,
    int limit)

    Returns a `TextLayout` on the given character range.

    Parameters:
    :   `start` - the index of the first character
    :   `limit` - the index after the last character. Must be greater
        than `start`

    Returns:
    :   a `TextLayout` for the characters beginning at
        `start` up to (but not including) `limit`

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if `limit` is less
        than `start`
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `start` or
        `limit` is not between the beginning of
        the paragraph and the end of the paragraph.
  + ### insertChar

    public void insertChar([AttributedCharacterIterator](../../../../java.base/java/text/AttributedCharacterIterator.md "interface in java.text") newParagraph,
    int insertPos)

    Updates the `TextMeasurer` after a single character has
    been inserted
    into the paragraph currently represented by this
    `TextMeasurer`. After this call, this
    `TextMeasurer` is equivalent to a new
    `TextMeasurer` created from the text; however, it will
    usually be more efficient to update an existing
    `TextMeasurer` than to create a new one from scratch.

    Parameters:
    :   `newParagraph` - the text of the paragraph after performing
        the insertion. Cannot be null.
    :   `insertPos` - the position in the text where the character was
        inserted. Must not be less than the start of
        `newParagraph`, and must be less than the end of
        `newParagraph`.

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if `insertPos` is less
        than the start of `newParagraph` or greater than
        or equal to the end of `newParagraph`
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `newParagraph` is
        `null`
  + ### deleteChar

    public void deleteChar([AttributedCharacterIterator](../../../../java.base/java/text/AttributedCharacterIterator.md "interface in java.text") newParagraph,
    int deletePos)

    Updates the `TextMeasurer` after a single character has
    been deleted
    from the paragraph currently represented by this
    `TextMeasurer`. After this call, this
    `TextMeasurer` is equivalent to a new `TextMeasurer`
    created from the text; however, it will usually be more efficient
    to update an existing `TextMeasurer` than to create a new one
    from scratch.

    Parameters:
    :   `newParagraph` - the text of the paragraph after performing
        the deletion. Cannot be null.
    :   `deletePos` - the position in the text where the character was removed.
        Must not be less than
        the start of `newParagraph`, and must not be greater than the
        end of `newParagraph`.

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if `deletePos` is
        less than the start of `newParagraph` or greater
        than the end of `newParagraph`
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `newParagraph` is
        `null`
