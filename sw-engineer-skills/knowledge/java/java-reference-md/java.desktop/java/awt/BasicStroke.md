java.awt.BasicStroke

All Implemented Interfaces:
:   `Stroke`

---

public class BasicStroke
extends [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Stroke](Stroke.md "interface in java.awt")

The `BasicStroke` class defines a basic set of rendering
attributes for the outlines of graphics primitives, which are rendered
with a [`Graphics2D`](Graphics2D.md "class in java.awt") object that has its Stroke attribute set to
this `BasicStroke`.
The rendering attributes defined by `BasicStroke` describe
the shape of the mark made by a pen drawn along the outline of a
[`Shape`](Shape.md "interface in java.awt") and the decorations applied at the ends and joins of
path segments of the `Shape`.
These rendering attributes include:

*width*: The pen width, measured perpendicularly to the pen trajectory. *end caps*: The decoration applied to the ends of unclosed subpaths and dash segments. Subpaths that start and end on the same point are still considered unclosed if they do not have a CLOSE segment. See [`SEG_CLOSE`](geom/PathIterator.md#SEG_CLOSE) for more information on the CLOSE segment. The three different decorations are: [`CAP_BUTT`](#CAP_BUTT), [`CAP_ROUND`](#CAP_ROUND), and [`CAP_SQUARE`](#CAP_SQUARE). *line joins*: The decoration applied at the intersection of two path segments and at the intersection of the endpoints of a subpath that is closed using [`SEG_CLOSE`](geom/PathIterator.md#SEG_CLOSE). The three different decorations are: [`JOIN_BEVEL`](#JOIN_BEVEL), [`JOIN_MITER`](#JOIN_MITER), and [`JOIN_ROUND`](#JOIN_ROUND). *miter limit*: The limit to trim a line join that has a JOIN\_MITER decoration. A line join is trimmed when the ratio of miter length to stroke width is greater than the miterlimit value. The miter length is the diagonal length of the miter, which is the distance between the inside corner and the outside corner of the intersection. The smaller the angle formed by two line segments, the longer the miter length and the sharper the angle of intersection. The default miterlimit value of 10.0f causes all angles less than 11 degrees to be trimmed. Trimming miters converts the decoration of the line join to bevel. *dash attributes*: The definition of how to make a dash pattern by alternating between opaque and transparent sections.

All attributes that specify measurements and distances controlling
the shape of the returned outline are measured in the same
coordinate system as the original unstroked `Shape`
argument. When a `Graphics2D` object uses a
`Stroke` object to redefine a path during the execution
of one of its `draw` methods, the geometry is supplied
in its original form before the `Graphics2D` transform
attribute is applied. Therefore, attributes such as the pen width
are interpreted in the user space coordinate system of the
`Graphics2D` object and are subject to the scaling and
shearing effects of the user-space-to-device-space transform in that
particular `Graphics2D`.
For example, the width of a rendered shape's outline is determined
not only by the width attribute of this `BasicStroke`,
but also by the transform attribute of the
`Graphics2D` object. Consider this code:
> ```
>       // sets the Graphics2D object's Transform attribute
>       g2d.scale(10, 10);
>       // sets the Graphics2D object's Stroke attribute
>       g2d.setStroke(new BasicStroke(1.5f));
> ```

Assuming there are no other scaling transforms added to the
`Graphics2D` object, the resulting line
will be approximately 15 pixels wide.
As the example code demonstrates, a floating-point line
offers better precision, especially when large transforms are
used with a `Graphics2D` object.
When a line is diagonal, the exact width depends on how the
rendering pipeline chooses which pixels to fill as it traces the
theoretical widened outline. The choice of which pixels to turn
on is affected by the antialiasing attribute because the
antialiasing rendering pipeline can choose to color
partially-covered pixels.

For more information on the user space coordinate system and the
rendering process, see the `Graphics2D` class comments.

    Returns:
    :   the limit of miter joins of the `BasicStroke`.
  + ### getDashArray

    public float[] getDashArray()

    Returns the array representing the lengths of the dash segments.
    Alternate entries in the array represent the user space lengths
    of the opaque and transparent segments of the dashes.
    As the pen moves along the outline of the `Shape`
    to be stroked, the user space
    distance that the pen travels is accumulated. The distance
    value is used to index into the dash array.
    The pen is opaque when its current cumulative distance maps
    to an even element of the dash array and transparent otherwise.

    Returns:
    :   the dash array.
  + ### getDashPhase

    public float getDashPhase()

    Returns the current dash phase.
    The dash phase is a distance specified in user coordinates that
    represents an offset into the dashing pattern. In other words, the dash
    phase defines the point in the dashing pattern that will correspond to
    the beginning of the stroke.

    Returns:

  + ### equals

    public boolean equals([Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") obj)

    Tests if a specified object is equal to this `BasicStroke`

    its width, join, cap, miter limit, dash, and dash phase attributes with
    those of this `BasicStroke`.

    Overrides:
    :   `equals` in class `Object`

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - the specified object to compare to this
        `BasicStroke`

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the width, join, cap, miter limit, dash, and
        dash phase are the same for both objects;
        `false` otherwise.
