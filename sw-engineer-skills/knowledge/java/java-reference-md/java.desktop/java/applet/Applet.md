public class Applet
extends [Panel](../awt/Panel.md "class in java.awt")

Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

The Applet API is deprecated, no replacement.

An applet is a small program that is intended not to be run on its own, but
rather to be embedded inside another application.

The `Applet` class must be the superclass of any applet that is to be
embedded in a Web page or viewed by the Java Applet Viewer. The
`Applet` class provides a standard interface between applets and their
environment.

:   1.0

    throws [HeadlessException](../awt/HeadlessException.md "class in java.awt")

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Constructs a new Applet.

    Note: Many methods in `java.applet.Applet` may be invoked by the
    applet only after the applet is fully constructed; applet should avoid
    calling methods in `java.applet.Applet` in the constructor.

    Throws:
    :   `HeadlessException` - if `GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()`
        returns `true`

    Since:
    :   1.4

  + ### isValidateRoot

    public boolean isValidateRoot()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Indicates if this container is a validate root.

    `Applet` objects are the validate roots, and, therefore, they
    override this method to return `true`.

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Returns information about the parameters that are understood by this
    applet. An applet should override this method to return an array of
    strings describing these parameters.

    Each element of the array should be a set of three strings containing the
    name, the type, and a description. For example:
    > ```
    >  String pinfo[][] = {
    >    {"fps",    "1-10",    "frames per second"},
    >    {"repeat", "boolean", "repeat image loop"},
    >    {"imgs",   "url",     "images directory"}
    >  };
    > ```

    The implementation of this method provided by the `Applet` class
    returns `null`.

    Returns:
    :   an array describing the parameters this applet looks for
  + ### play

    public void play([URL](../../../java.base/java/net/URL.md "class in java.net") url)

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Plays the audio clip at the specified absolute `URL`. Nothing
    happens if the audio clip cannot be found.

    Parameters:
    :   `url` - an absolute `URL` giving the location of the audio clip
  + ### play

    public void play([URL](../../../java.base/java/net/URL.md "class in java.net") url,
    [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name)

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Plays the audio clip given the `URL` and a specifier that is
    relative to it. Nothing happens if the audio clip cannot be found.

    Parameters:
    :   `url` - an absolute `URL` giving the base location of the audio
        clip
    :   `name` - the location of the audio clip, relative to the `url`
        argument
  + ### init

    public void init()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it has
    been loaded into the system. It is always called before the first time
    that the `start` method is called.

    A subclass of `Applet` should override this method if it has
    initialization to perform. For example, an applet with threads would use
    the `init` method to create the threads and the `destroy`
    method to kill them.

    The implementation of this method provided by the `Applet` class
    does nothing.

    See Also:
    :   - [`destroy()`](#destroy())
        - [`start()`](#start())
        - [`stop()`](#stop())
  + ### start

    public void start()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it
    should start its execution. It is called after the `init` method
    and each time the applet is revisited in a Web page.

    A subclass of `Applet` should override this method if it has any
    operation that it wants to perform each time the Web page containing it
    is visited. For example, an applet with animation might want to use the
    `start` method to resume animation, and the `stop` method to
    suspend the animation.

    Note: some methods, such as `getLocationOnScreen`, can only provide
    meaningful results if the applet is showing. Because `isShowing`
    returns `false` when the applet's `start` is first called,
    methods requiring `isShowing` to return `true` should be
    called from a `ComponentListener`.

  + ### stop

    public void stop()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it
    should stop its execution. It is called when the Web page that contains
    this applet has been replaced by another page, and also just before the
    applet is to be destroyed.

    A subclass of `Applet` should override this method if it has any
    operation that it wants to perform each time the Web page containing it
    is no longer visible. For example, an applet with animation might want to
    use the `start` method to resume animation, and the `stop`
    method to suspend the animation.

    The implementation of this method provided by the `Applet` class
    does nothing.

  + ### destroy

    public void destroy()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it is
    being reclaimed and that it should destroy any resources that it has
    allocated. The `stop` method will always be called before
    `destroy`.

    A subclass of `Applet` should override this method if it has any
    operation that it wants to perform before it is destroyed. For example,
    an applet with threads would use the `init` method to create the
    threads and the `destroy` method to kill them.

    The implementation of this method provided by the `Applet` class
    does nothing.

  + ### getAccessibleContext

    public [AccessibleContext](../../javax/accessibility/AccessibleContext.md "class in javax.accessibility") getAccessibleContext()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Gets the `AccessibleContext` associated with this `Applet`.
    For applets, the `AccessibleContext` takes the form of an
    `AccessibleApplet`. A new `AccessibleApplet` instance is
    created if necessary.

    Specified by:
    :   `getAccessibleContext` in interface `Accessible`

    Overrides:
    :   `getAccessibleContext` in class `Panel`

    Returns:
    :   an `AccessibleApplet` that serves as the
        `AccessibleContext` of this `Applet`

    Since:
    :   1.3
