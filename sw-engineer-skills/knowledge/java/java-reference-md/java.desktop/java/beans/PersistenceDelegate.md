public abstract class PersistenceDelegate
extends [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

The PersistenceDelegate class takes the responsibility
for expressing the state of an instance of a given class
in terms of the methods in the class's public API. Instead
of associating the responsibility of persistence with
the class itself as is done, for example, by the
`readObject` and `writeObject`
methods used by the `ObjectOutputStream`, streams like
the `XMLEncoder` which
use this delegation model can have their behavior controlled
independently of the classes themselves. Normally, the class
is the best place to put such information and conventions
can easily be expressed in this delegation scheme to do just that.
Sometimes however, it is the case that a minor problem
in a single class prevents an entire object graph from
being written and this can leave the application
developer with no recourse but to attempt to shadow
the problematic classes locally or use alternative
persistence techniques. In situations like these, the
delegation model gives a relatively clean mechanism for
the application developer to intervene in all parts of the
serialization process without requiring that modifications
be made to the implementation of classes which are not part
of the application itself.

In addition to using a delegation model, this persistence
scheme differs from traditional serialization schemes
in requiring an analog of the `writeObject`
method without a corresponding `readObject`
method. The `writeObject` analog encodes each
instance in terms of its public API and there is no need to
define a `readObject` analog
since the procedure for reading the serialized form
is defined by the semantics of method invocation as laid
out in the Java Language Specification.
Breaking the dependency between `writeObject`
and `readObject` implementations, which may
change from version to version, is the key factor
in making the archives produced by this technique immune
to changes in the private implementations of the classes
to which they refer.

A persistence delegate, may take control of all
aspects of the persistence of an object including:

* Deciding whether or not an instance can be mutated
  into another instance of the same class.* Instantiating the object, either by calling a
    public constructor or a public factory method.* Performing the initialization of the object.

  Method

  Description

  `protected void`

  `initialize(Class<?> type,

  Object newInstance,
  Encoder out)`

  Produce a series of statements with side effects on `newInstance`
  so that the new instance becomes *equivalent* to `oldInstance`.

  `protected abstract Expression`

  `instantiate(Object oldInstance,
  Encoder out)`

  Returns an expression whose value is `oldInstance`.

  `protected boolean`

  `mutatesTo(Object oldInstance,
  Object newInstance)`

  Returns true if an *equivalent* copy of `oldInstance` may be
  created by applying a series of statements to `newInstance`.

  `void`

  `writeObject(Object oldInstance,
  Encoder out)`

  The `writeObject` is a single entry point to the persistence
  and is used by an `Encoder` in the traditional
  mode of delegation.

  + ### writeObject

    public void writeObject([Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") oldInstance,
    [Encoder](Encoder.md "class in java.beans") out)

    The `writeObject` is a single entry point to the persistence
    and is used by an `Encoder` in the traditional
    mode of delegation. Although this method is not final,
    it should not need to be subclassed under normal circumstances.

    This implementation first checks to see if the stream
    has already encountered this object. Next the
    `mutatesTo` method is called to see if
    that candidate returned from the stream can
    be mutated into an accurate copy of `oldInstance`.
    If it can, the `initialize` method is called to
    perform the initialization. If not, the candidate is removed
    from the stream, and the `instantiate` method
    is called to create a new candidate for this object.

    Parameters:
    :   `oldInstance` - The instance that will be created by this expression.
    :   `out` - The stream to which this expression will be written.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `out` is `null`
  + ### mutatesTo

    protected boolean mutatesTo([Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") oldInstance,
    [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") newInstance)

    Returns true if an *equivalent* copy of `oldInstance` may be
    created by applying a series of statements to `newInstance`.
    In the specification of this method, we mean by equivalent that the modified instance
    is indistinguishable from `oldInstance` in the behavior
    of the relevant methods in its public API. [Note: we use the
    phrase *relevant* methods rather than *all* methods
    here only because, to be strictly correct, methods like `hashCode`
    and `toString` prevent most classes from producing truly
    indistinguishable copies of their instances].

    The default behavior returns `true`
    if the classes of the two instances are the same.

    Parameters:
    :   `oldInstance` - The instance to be copied.
    :   `newInstance` - The instance that is to be modified.

    Returns:
    :   True if an equivalent copy of `newInstance` may be
        created by applying a series of mutations to `oldInstance`.
  + ### instantiate

    protected abstract [Expression](Expression.md "class in java.beans") instantiate([Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") oldInstance,
    [Encoder](Encoder.md "class in java.beans") out)

    Returns an expression whose value is `oldInstance`.
    This method is used to characterize the constructor
    or factory method that should be used to create the given object.
    For example, the `instantiate` method of the persistence
    delegate for the `Field` class could be defined as follows:

    ```
     Field f = (Field)oldInstance;
     return new Expression(f, f.getDeclaringClass(), "getField", new Object[]{f.getName()});
    ```

    Note that we declare the value of the returned expression so that
    the value of the expression (as returned by `getValue`)
    will be identical to `oldInstance`.

    Parameters:
    :   `oldInstance` - The instance that will be created by this expression.
    :   `out` - The stream to which this expression will be written.

    Returns:
    :   An expression whose value is `oldInstance`.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `out` is `null`
        and this value is used in the method
  + ### initialize

    protected void initialize([Class](../../../java.base/java/lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<?> type,
    [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") oldInstance,
    [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") newInstance,
    [Encoder](Encoder.md "class in java.beans") out)

    Produce a series of statements with side effects on `newInstance`
    so that the new instance becomes *equivalent* to `oldInstance`.
    In the specification of this method, we mean by equivalent that, after the method
    returns, the modified instance is indistinguishable from
    `newInstance` in the behavior of all methods in its
    public API.

    The implementation typically achieves this goal by producing a series of
    "what happened" statements involving the `oldInstance`
    and its publicly available state. These statements are sent
    to the output stream using its `writeExpression`
    method which returns an expression involving elements in
    a cloned environment simulating the state of an input stream during
    reading. Each statement returned will have had all instances
    the old environment replaced with objects which exist in the new
    one. In particular, references to the target of these statements,
    which start out as references to `oldInstance` are returned
    as references to the `newInstance` instead.
    Executing these statements effects an incremental
    alignment of the state of the two objects as a series of
    modifications to the objects in the new environment.
    By the time the initialize method returns it should be impossible
    to tell the two instances apart by using their public APIs.
    Most importantly, the sequence of steps that were used to make
    these objects appear equivalent will have been recorded
    by the output stream and will form the actual output when
    the stream is flushed.

    The default implementation, calls the `initialize`
    method of the type's superclass.

    Parameters:
    :   `type` - the type of the instances
    :   `oldInstance` - The instance to be copied.
    :   `newInstance` - The instance that is to be modified.
    :   `out` - The stream to which any initialization statements should be written.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `out` is `null`
