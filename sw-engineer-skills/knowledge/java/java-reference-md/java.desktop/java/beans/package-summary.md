# Package java.beans

---

package java.beans

Contains classes related to developing *beans* -- components based on
the JavaBeans architecture. A few of the classes are used by beans
while they run in an application. For example, the event classes are used by
beans that fire property and vetoable change events (see
[`PropertyChangeEvent`](PropertyChangeEvent.md "class in java.beans")). However, most of the classes in this
package are meant to be used by a bean editor (that is, a development
environment for customizing and putting together beans to create an
application). In particular, these classes help the bean editor create a user
interface that the user can use to customize the bean. For example, a bean
may contain a property of a special type that a bean editor may not know how
to handle. By using the `PropertyEditor` interface, a bean developer
can provide an editor for this special type.

To minimize the resources used by a bean, the classes used by bean editors
are loaded only when the bean is being edited. They are not needed while the
bean is running in an application and therefore not loaded. This information
is kept in what's called a bean-info (see [`BeanInfo`](BeanInfo.md "interface in java.beans")).

Unless explicitly stated, null values or empty Strings are not valid
parameters for the methods in this package. You may expect to see exceptions
if these parameters are used.

## Long-Term Persistence

As of v1.4, the `java.beans` package provides support for *long-term
persistence* -- reading and writing a bean as a textual representation of
its property values. The property values are treated as beans, and are
recursively read or written to capture their publicly available state. This
approach is suitable for long-term storage because it relies only on public
API, rather than the likely-to-change private implementation.

You read and write beans in XML format using the
[`XMLDecoder`](XMLDecoder.md "class in java.beans") and [`XMLEncoder`](XMLEncoder.md "class in java.beans") classes,
respectively. One notable feature of the persistence scheme is that reading
in a bean requires no special knowledge of the bean.

Writing out a bean, on the other hand, sometimes requires special knowledge
of the bean's type. If the bean's state can be expressed using only the
no-argument constructor and public getter and setter methods for properties,
no special knowledge is required. Otherwise, the bean requires a custom
*persistence delegate* -- an object that is in charge of writing out
beans of a particular type. All classes provided in the JDK that descend from
`java.awt.Component`, as well as all their properties, automatically
have persistence delegates.

If you need (or choose) to provide a persistence delegate for a bean, you can
do so either by using a [`DefaultPersistenceDelegate`](DefaultPersistenceDelegate.md "class in java.beans")
instance or by creating your own subclass of `PersistenceDelegate`. If
the only reason a bean needs a persistence delegate is because you want to
invoke the bean's constructor with property values as arguments, you can
create the bean's persistence delegate with the one-argument
`DefaultPersistenceDelegate` constructor. Otherwise, you need to
implement your own persistence delegate, for which you're likely to need the
following classes:

[`PersistenceDelegate`](PersistenceDelegate.md "class in java.beans")
:   The abstract class from which all persistence delegates descend. Your
    subclass should use its knowledge of the bean's type to provide whatever
    `Statement`s and `Expression`s are necessary to create the
    bean and restore its state.

[`Statement`](Statement.md "class in java.beans")
:   Represents the invocation of a single method on an object. Includes
    a set of arguments to the method.

[`Expression`](Expression.md "class in java.beans")
:   A subclass of `Statement` used for methods that return a
    value.

Once you create a persistence delegate, you register it using the
`setPersistenceDelegate` method of `XMLEncoder`.
