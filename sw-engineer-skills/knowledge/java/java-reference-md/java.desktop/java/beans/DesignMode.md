# Interface DesignMode

All Known Subinterfaces:
:   `BeanContext`, `BeanContextServices`

All Known Implementing Classes:
:   `BeanContextServicesSupport`, `BeanContextSupport`

---

public interface DesignMode

This interface is intended to be implemented by, or delegated from, instances
of java.beans.beancontext.BeanContext, in order to propagate to its nested hierarchy
of java.beans.beancontext.BeanContextChild instances, the current "designTime" property.

The JavaBeans specification defines the notion of design time as is a
mode in which JavaBeans instances should function during their composition
and customization in a interactive design, composition or construction tool,
as opposed to runtime when the JavaBean is part of an applet, application,
or other live Java executable abstraction.

Since:
:   1.2

  Description

  `boolean`

  `isDesignTime()`

  A value of true denotes that JavaBeans should behave in design time
  mode, a value of false denotes runtime behavior.

  `void`

  `setDesignTime(boolean designTime)`

  Sets the "value" of the "designTime" property.

    static final [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") PROPERTYNAME

    The standard value of the propertyName as fired from a BeanContext or
    other source of PropertyChangeEvents.

* ## Method Details

  + ### setDesignTime

    void setDesignTime(boolean designTime)

    Sets the "value" of the "designTime" property.

    If the implementing object is an instance of java.beans.beancontext.BeanContext,
    or a subinterface thereof, then that BeanContext should fire a
    PropertyChangeEvent, to its registered BeanContextMembershipListeners, with
    parameters:
    - `propertyName` - `java.beans.DesignMode.PROPERTYNAME`- `oldValue` - previous value of "designTime"- `newValue` - current value of "designTime"Note it is illegal for a BeanContextChild to invoke this method
    associated with a BeanContext that it is nested within.

    Parameters:
    :   `designTime` - the current "value" of the "designTime" property

        - [`PropertyChangeEvent`](PropertyChangeEvent.md "class in java.beans")
  + ### isDesignTime

    boolean isDesignTime()

    A value of true denotes that JavaBeans should behave in design time
    mode, a value of false denotes runtime behavior.

    Returns:
    :   the current "value" of the "designTime" property.
