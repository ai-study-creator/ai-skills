# Interface PropertyEditor

All Known Implementing Classes:
:   `PropertyEditorSupport`

---

public interface PropertyEditor

A PropertyEditor class provides support for GUIs that want to
allow users to edit a property value of a given type.

PropertyEditor supports a variety of different kinds of ways of
displaying and updating property values. Most PropertyEditors will
only need to support a subset of the different options available in
this API.

Simple PropertyEditors may only support the getAsText and setAsText
methods and need not support (say) paintValue or getCustomEditor. More
complex types may be unable to support getAsText and setAsText but will
instead support paintValue and getCustomEditor.

Every propertyEditor must support one or more of the three simple
display styles. Thus it can either (1) support isPaintable or (2)
both return a non-null String[] from getTags() and return a non-null
value from getAsText or (3) simply return a non-null String from
getAsText().

Every property editor must support a call on setValue when the argument
object is of the type for which this is the corresponding propertyEditor.
In addition, each property editor must either support a custom editor,
or support setAsText.

Each PropertyEditor should have a null constructor.

* ## Method Details

  + ### setValue

    void setValue([Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") value)

    Set (or change) the object that is to be edited. Primitive types such
    as "int" must be wrapped as the corresponding object type such as
    "java.lang.Integer".

    Parameters:
    :   `value` - The new target object to be edited. Note that this
        object should not be modified by the PropertyEditor, rather
        the PropertyEditor should create a new object to hold any
        modified value.
  + ### getValue

    [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") getValue()

    Gets the property value.

    Returns:
    :   The value of the property. Primitive types such as "int" will
        be wrapped as the corresponding object type such as "java.lang.Integer".
  + ### isPaintable

    boolean isPaintable()

    Determines whether this property editor is paintable.

    Returns:
    :   True if the class will honor the paintValue method.
  + ### paintValue

    void paintValue([Graphics](../awt/Graphics.md "class in java.awt") gfx,
    [Rectangle](../awt/Rectangle.md "class in java.awt") box)

    Paint a representation of the value into a given area of screen
    real estate. Note that the propertyEditor is responsible for doing
    its own clipping so that it fits into the given rectangle.

    If the PropertyEditor doesn't honor paint requests (see isPaintable)
    this method should be a silent noop.

    The given Graphics object will have the default font, color, etc of
    the parent container. The PropertyEditor may change graphics attributes
    such as font and color and doesn't need to restore the old values.

    Parameters:
    :   `gfx` - Graphics object to paint into.
    :   `box` - Rectangle within graphics object into which we should paint.
  + ### getJavaInitializationString

    [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getJavaInitializationString()

    Returns a fragment of Java code that can be used to set a property
    to match the editors current state. This method is intended
    for use when generating Java code to reflect changes made through the
    property editor.

    The code fragment should be context free and must be a legal Java
    expression as specified by the JLS.

    Specifically, if the expression represents a computation then all
    classes and static members should be fully qualified. This rule
    applies to constructors, static methods and non primitive arguments.

    Caution should be used when evaluating the expression as it may throw
    exceptions. In particular, code generators must ensure that generated
    code will compile in the presence of an expression that can throw
    checked exceptions.

    Example results are:
    - Primitive expression: `2`- Class constructor: `new java.awt.Color(127,127,34)`- Static field: `java.awt.Color.orange`- Static method: `javax.swing.Box.createRigidArea(new
            java.awt.Dimension(0, 5))`

    Returns:
    :   a fragment of Java code representing an initializer for the
        current value. It should not contain a semi-colon
        ('`;`') to end the expression.
  + ### getAsText

    [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getAsText()

    Gets the property value as text.

    Returns:
    :   The property value as a human editable string.

        Returns null if the value can't be expressed as an editable string.

        If a non-null value is returned, then the PropertyEditor should
        be prepared to parse that string back in setAsText().
  + ### setAsText

    void setAsText([String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") text)
    throws [IllegalArgumentException](../../../java.base/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.md "class in java.lang")

    Set the property value by parsing a given String. May raise
    java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if either the String is
    badly formatted or if this kind of property can't be expressed
    as text.

    Parameters:
    :   `text` - The string to be parsed.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException`
  + ### getTags

    [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] getTags()

    If the property value must be one of a set of known tagged values,
    then this method should return an array of the tags. This can
    be used to represent (for example) enum values. If a PropertyEditor
    supports tags, then it should support the use of setAsText with
    a tag value as a way of setting the value and the use of getAsText
    to identify the current value.

    Returns:
    :   The tag values for this property. May be null if this
        property cannot be represented as a tagged value.
  + ### getCustomEditor

    [Component](../awt/Component.md "class in java.awt") getCustomEditor()

    A PropertyEditor may choose to make available a full custom Component
    that edits its property value. It is the responsibility of the
    PropertyEditor to hook itself up to its editor Component itself and
    to report property value changes by firing a PropertyChange event.

    The higher-level code that calls getCustomEditor may either embed
    the Component in some larger property sheet, or it may put it in
    its own individual dialog, or ...

    Returns:
    :   A java.awt.Component that will allow a human to directly
        edit the current property value. May be null if this is
        not supported.
  + ### supportsCustomEditor

    boolean supportsCustomEditor()

    Determines whether this property editor supports a custom editor.

    Returns:
    :   True if the propertyEditor can provide a custom editor.
  + ### addPropertyChangeListener

    void addPropertyChangeListener([PropertyChangeListener](PropertyChangeListener.md "interface in java.beans") listener)

    Adds a listener for the value change.
    When the property editor changes its value
    it should fire a [`PropertyChangeEvent`](PropertyChangeEvent.md "class in java.beans")
    on all registered [`PropertyChangeListener`](PropertyChangeListener.md "interface in java.beans")s,
    specifying the `null` value for the property name
    and itself as the source.

    Parameters:
    :   `listener` - the [`PropertyChangeListener`](PropertyChangeListener.md "interface in java.beans") to add
  + ### removePropertyChangeListener

    void removePropertyChangeListener([PropertyChangeListener](PropertyChangeListener.md "interface in java.beans") listener)

    Removes a listener for the value change.

    Parameters:
    :   `listener` - the [`PropertyChangeListener`](PropertyChangeListener.md "interface in java.beans") to remove
