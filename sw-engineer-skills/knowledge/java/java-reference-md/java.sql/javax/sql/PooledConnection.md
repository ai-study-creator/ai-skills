# Interface PooledConnection

All Known Subinterfaces:
:   `XAConnection`

---

public interface PooledConnection

An object that provides hooks for connection pool management.
A `PooledConnection` object
represents a physical connection to a data source. The connection
can be recycled rather than being closed when an application is
finished with it, thus reducing the number of connections that
need to be made.

An application programmer does not use the `PooledConnection`
interface directly; rather, it is used by a middle tier infrastructure
that manages the pooling of connections.

When an application calls the method `DataSource.getConnection`,
it gets back a `Connection` object. If connection pooling is
being done, that `Connection` object is actually a handle to
a `PooledConnection` object, which is a physical connection.

The connection pool manager, typically the application server, maintains
a pool of `PooledConnection` objects. If there is a
`PooledConnection` object available in the pool, the
connection pool manager returns a `Connection` object that
is a handle to that physical connection.
If no `PooledConnection` object is available, the
connection pool manager calls the `ConnectionPoolDataSource`
method `getPoolConnection` to create a new physical connection. The
JDBC driver implementing `ConnectionPoolDataSource` creates a
new `PooledConnection` object and returns a handle to it.

When an application closes a connection, it calls the `Connection`
method `close`. When connection pooling is being done,
the connection pool manager is notified because it has registered itself as
a `ConnectionEventListener` object using the
`ConnectionPool` method `addConnectionEventListener`.
The connection pool manager deactivates the handle to
the `PooledConnection` object and returns the
`PooledConnection` object to the pool of connections so that
it can be used again. Thus, when an application closes its connection,
the underlying physical connection is recycled rather than being closed.

If the connection pool manager wraps or provides a proxy to the logical
handle returned from a call to `PoolConnection.getConnection`, the pool
manager must do one of the following when the connection pool manager
closes or returns the `PooledConnection` to the pool in response to
the application calling `Connection.close`:

* call `endRequest` on the logical `Connection` handle* call `close` on the logical `Connection` handle

The physical connection is not closed until the connection pool manager
calls the `PooledConnection` method `close`.
This method is generally called to have an orderly shutdown of the server or
if a fatal error has made the connection unusable.

A connection pool manager is often also a statement pool manager, maintaining
a pool of `PreparedStatement` objects.
When an application closes a prepared statement, it calls the
`PreparedStatement`
method `close`. When `Statement` pooling is being done,
the pool manager is notified because it has registered itself as
a `StatementEventListener` object using the
`ConnectionPool` method `addStatementEventListener`.
Thus, when an application closes its `PreparedStatement`,
the underlying prepared statement is recycled rather than being closed.

* ## Method Details

  + ### getConnection

    [Connection](../../java/sql/Connection.md "interface in java.sql") getConnection()
    throws [SQLException](../../java/sql/SQLException.md "class in java.sql")

    Creates and returns a `Connection` object that is a handle
    for the physical connection that
    this `PooledConnection` object represents.
    The connection pool manager calls this method when an application has
    called the method `DataSource.getConnection` and there are
    no `PooledConnection` objects available. See the
    [`interface description`](PooledConnection.md "interface in javax.sql") for more information.

    Returns:
    :   a `Connection` object that is a handle to
        this `PooledConnection` object

    Throws:
    :   `SQLException` - if a database access error occurs
    :   `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` - if the JDBC driver does not support
        this method

    Since:
    :   1.4
  + ### close

    void close()
    throws [SQLException](../../java/sql/SQLException.md "class in java.sql")

    Closes the physical connection that this `PooledConnection`
    object represents. An application never calls this method directly;
    it is called by the connection pool module, or manager.

    See the [`interface description`](PooledConnection.md "interface in javax.sql") for more
    information.

    Throws:
    :   `SQLException` - if a database access error occurs
    :   `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` - if the JDBC driver does not support
        this method

    Since:
    :   1.4
  + ### addConnectionEventListener

    void addConnectionEventListener([ConnectionEventListener](ConnectionEventListener.md "interface in javax.sql") listener)

    Registers the given event listener so that it will be notified
    when an event occurs on this `PooledConnection` object.

    Parameters:
    :   `listener` - a component, usually the connection pool manager,
        that has implemented the
        `ConnectionEventListener` interface and wants to be
        notified when the connection is closed or has an error

    See Also:
    :   - [`removeConnectionEventListener(javax.sql.ConnectionEventListener)`](#removeConnectionEventListener(javax.sql.ConnectionEventListener))
  + ### removeConnectionEventListener

    void removeConnectionEventListener([ConnectionEventListener](ConnectionEventListener.md "interface in javax.sql") listener)

    Removes the given event listener from the list of components that
    will be notified when an event occurs on this
    `PooledConnection` object.

    Parameters:
    :   `listener` - a component, usually the connection pool manager,
        that has implemented the
        `ConnectionEventListener` interface and
        been registered with this `PooledConnection` object as
        a listener

    See Also:
    :   - [`addConnectionEventListener(javax.sql.ConnectionEventListener)`](#addConnectionEventListener(javax.sql.ConnectionEventListener))
  + ### addStatementEventListener

    void addStatementEventListener([StatementEventListener](StatementEventListener.md "interface in javax.sql") listener)

    Registers a `StatementEventListener` with this `PooledConnection` object. Components that
    wish to be notified when `PreparedStatement`s created by the
    connection are closed or are detected to be invalid may use this method
    to register a `StatementEventListener` with this `PooledConnection` object.

    Parameters:
    :   `listener` - an component which implements the `StatementEventListener`
        interface that is to be registered with this `PooledConnection` object

    Since:
    :   1.6
  + ### removeStatementEventListener

    void removeStatementEventListener([StatementEventListener](StatementEventListener.md "interface in javax.sql") listener)

    Removes the specified `StatementEventListener` from the list of
    components that will be notified when the driver detects that a
    `PreparedStatement` has been closed or is invalid.

    Parameters:
    :   `listener` - the component which implements the
        `StatementEventListener` interface that was previously
        registered with this `PooledConnection` object
