# Interface Driver

---

public interface Driver

The interface that every driver class must implement.

The Java SQL framework allows for multiple database drivers.

Each driver should supply a class that implements
the Driver interface.

The DriverManager will try to load as many drivers as it can
find and then for any given connection request, it will ask each
driver in turn to try to connect to the target URL.

It is strongly recommended that each Driver class should be
small and standalone so that the Driver class can be loaded and
queried without bringing in vast quantities of supporting code.

When a Driver class is loaded, it should create an instance of
itself and register it with the DriverManager. This means that a
user can load and register a driver by calling:

`Class.forName("foo.bah.Driver")`

A JDBC driver may create a [DriverAction](DriverAction.md "interface in java.sql") implementation in order
to receive notifications when [DriverManager.deregisterDriver(java.sql.Driver)](DriverManager.md#deregisterDriver(java.sql.Driver)) has
been called.

* ## Method Details

  + ### connect

    [Connection](Connection.md "interface in java.sql") connect([String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") url,
    [Properties](../../../java.base/java/util/Properties.md "class in java.util") info)
    throws [SQLException](SQLException.md "class in java.sql")

    Attempts to make a database connection to the given URL.
    The driver should return "null" if it realizes it is the wrong kind
    of driver to connect to the given URL. This will be common, as when
    the JDBC driver manager is asked to connect to a given URL it passes
    the URL to each loaded driver in turn.

    The driver should throw an `SQLException` if it is the right
    driver to connect to the given URL but has trouble connecting to
    the database.

    The `Properties` argument can be used to pass
    arbitrary string tag/value pairs as connection arguments.
    Normally at least "user" and "password" properties should be
    included in the `Properties` object.

    **Note:** If a property is specified as part of the `url` and
    is also specified in the `Properties` object, it is
    implementation-defined as to which value will take precedence. For
    maximum portability, an application should only specify a property once.

    Parameters:
    :   `url` - the URL of the database to which to connect
    :   `info` - a list of arbitrary string tag/value pairs as
        connection arguments. Normally at least a "user" and
        "password" property should be included.

    Returns:
    :   a `Connection` object that represents a
        connection to the URL

    Throws:
    :   `SQLException` - if a database access error occurs or the url is
        `null`
  + ### acceptsURL

    boolean acceptsURL([String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") url)
    throws [SQLException](SQLException.md "class in java.sql")

    Retrieves whether the driver thinks that it can open a connection
    to the given URL. Typically drivers will return `true` if they
    understand the sub-protocol specified in the URL and `false` if
    they do not.

    Parameters:
    :   `url` - the URL of the database

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this driver understands the given URL;
        `false` otherwise

    Throws:
    :   `SQLException` - if a database access error occurs or the url is
        `null`
  + ### getPropertyInfo

    [DriverPropertyInfo](DriverPropertyInfo.md "class in java.sql")[] getPropertyInfo([String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") url,
    [Properties](../../../java.base/java/util/Properties.md "class in java.util") info)
    throws [SQLException](SQLException.md "class in java.sql")

    Gets information about the possible properties for this driver.

    The `getPropertyInfo` method is intended to allow a generic
    GUI tool to discover what properties it should prompt
    a human for in order to get
    enough information to connect to a database. Note that depending on
    the values the human has supplied so far, additional values may become
    necessary, so it may be necessary to iterate though several calls
    to the `getPropertyInfo` method.

    Parameters:
    :   `url` - the URL of the database to which to connect
    :   `info` - a proposed list of tag/value pairs that will be sent on
        connect open

    Returns:
    :   an array of `DriverPropertyInfo` objects describing
        possible properties. This array may be an empty array if
        no properties are required.

    Throws:
    :   `SQLException` - if a database access error occurs
  + ### getMajorVersion

    int getMajorVersion()

    Retrieves the driver's major version number. Initially this should be 1.

    Returns:
    :   this driver's major version number
  + ### getMinorVersion

    int getMinorVersion()

    Gets the driver's minor version number. Initially this should be 0.

    Returns:
    :   this driver's minor version number
  + ### jdbcCompliant

    boolean jdbcCompliant()

    Reports whether this driver is a genuine JDBC
    Compliant driver.
    A driver may only report `true` here if it passes the JDBC
    compliance tests; otherwise it is required to return `false`.

    JDBC compliance requires full support for the JDBC API and full support
    for SQL 92 Entry Level. It is expected that JDBC compliant drivers will
    be available for all the major commercial databases.

    This method is not intended to encourage the development of non-JDBC
    compliant drivers, but is a recognition of the fact that some vendors
    are interested in using the JDBC API and framework for lightweight
    databases that do not support full database functionality, or for
    special databases such as document information retrieval where a SQL
    implementation may not be feasible.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this driver is JDBC Compliant; `false`
        otherwise
  + ### getParentLogger

    [Logger](../../../java.logging/java/util/logging/Logger.md "class in java.util.logging") getParentLogger()
    throws [SQLFeatureNotSupportedException](SQLFeatureNotSupportedException.md "class in java.sql")

    Return the parent Logger of all the Loggers used by this driver. This
    should be the Logger farthest from the root Logger that is
    still an ancestor of all of the Loggers used by this driver. Configuring
    this Logger will affect all of the log messages generated by the driver.
    In the worst case, this may be the root Logger.

    Returns:
    :   the parent Logger for this driver

    Throws:
    :   `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` - if the driver does not use
        `java.util.logging`.
