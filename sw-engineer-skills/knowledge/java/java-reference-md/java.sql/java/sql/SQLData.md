# Interface SQLData

---

public interface SQLData

The interface used for the custom mapping of an SQL user-defined type (UDT) to
a class in the Java programming language. The class object for a class
implementing the `SQLData` interface will be entered in the
appropriate `Connection` object's type map along with the SQL
name of the UDT for which it is a custom mapping.

Typically, a `SQLData` implementation
will define a field for each attribute of an SQL structured type or a
single field for an SQL `DISTINCT` type. When the UDT is
retrieved from a data source with the `ResultSet.getObject`
method, it will be mapped as an instance of this class. A programmer
can operate on this class instance just as on any other object in the
Java programming language and then store any changes made to it by
calling the `PreparedStatement.setObject` method,
which will map it back to the SQL type.

It is expected that the implementation of the class for a custom
mapping will be done by a tool. In a typical implementation, the
programmer would simply supply the name of the SQL UDT, the name of
the class to which it is being mapped, and the names of the fields to
which each of the attributes of the UDT is to be mapped. The tool will use
this information to implement the `SQLData.readSQL` and
`SQLData.writeSQL` methods. The `readSQL` method
calls the appropriate `SQLInput` methods to read
each attribute from an `SQLInput` object, and the
`writeSQL` method calls `SQLOutput` methods
to write each attribute back to the data source via an
`SQLOutput` object.

An application programmer will not normally call `SQLData` methods
directly, and the `SQLInput` and `SQLOutput` methods
are called internally by `SQLData` methods, not by application code.

  its SQL value in the data source.

* ## Method Details

  + ### getSQLTypeName

    [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getSQLTypeName()
    throws [SQLException](SQLException.md "class in java.sql")

    Returns the fully-qualified
    name of the SQL user-defined type that this object represents.
    This method is called by the JDBC driver to get the name of the
    UDT instance that is being mapped to this instance of
    `SQLData`.

    Returns:
    :   the type name that was passed to the method `readSQL`
        when this object was constructed and populated

    Throws:
    :   `SQLException` - if there is a database access error
    :   `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` - if the JDBC driver does not support
        this method

    Since:
    :   1.2
  + ### readSQL

    void readSQL([SQLInput](SQLInput.md "interface in java.sql") stream,
    [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") typeName)
    throws [SQLException](SQLException.md "class in java.sql")

    Populates this object with data read from the database.
    The implementation of the method must follow this protocol:
    - It must read each of the attributes or elements of the SQL
      type from the given input stream. This is done
      by calling a method of the input stream to read each
      item, in the order that they appear in the SQL definition
      of the type.- The method `readSQL` then
        assigns the data to appropriate fields or
        elements (of this or other objects).
        Specifically, it must call the appropriate *reader* method
        (`SQLInput.readString`, `SQLInput.readBigDecimal`,
        and so on) method(s) to do the following:
        for a distinct type, read its single data element;
        for a structured type, read a value for each attribute of the SQL type.The JDBC driver initializes the input stream with a type map
    before calling this method, which is used by the appropriate
    `SQLInput` reader method on the stream.

    Parameters:
    :   `stream` - the `SQLInput` object from which to read the data for
        the value that is being custom mapped
    :   `typeName` - the SQL type name of the value on the data stream

    Throws:
    :   `SQLException` - if there is a database access error
    :   `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` - if the JDBC driver does not support
        this method

  + ### writeSQL

    void writeSQL([SQLOutput](SQLOutput.md "interface in java.sql") stream)
    throws [SQLException](SQLException.md "class in java.sql")

    Writes this object to the given SQL data stream, converting it back to
    its SQL value in the data source.
    The implementation of the method must follow this protocol:  
    It must write each of the attributes of the SQL type
    to the given output stream. This is done by calling a
    method of the output stream to write each item, in the order that
    they appear in the SQL definition of the type.
    Specifically, it must call the appropriate `SQLOutput` writer
    method(s) (`writeInt`, `writeString`, and so on)
    to do the following: for a Distinct Type, write its single data element;
    for a Structured Type, write a value for each attribute of the SQL type.

    Parameters:
    :   `stream` - the `SQLOutput` object to which to write the data for
        the value that was custom mapped

    Throws:
    :   `SQLException` - if there is a database access error
    :   `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` - if the JDBC driver does not support
        this method
