# Interface Blob

All Known Implementing Classes:
:   `SerialBlob`

---

public interface Blob

The representation (mapping) in
the Java programming language of an SQL
`BLOB` value. An SQL `BLOB` is a built-in type
that stores a Binary Large Object as a column value in a row of
a database table. By default drivers implement `Blob` using
an SQL `locator(BLOB)`, which means that a
`Blob` object contains a logical pointer to the
SQL `BLOB` data rather than the data itself.
A `Blob` object is valid for the duration of the
transaction in which is was created.

Methods in the interfaces [`ResultSet`](ResultSet.md "interface in java.sql"),
[`CallableStatement`](CallableStatement.md "interface in java.sql"), and [`PreparedStatement`](PreparedStatement.md "interface in java.sql"), such as
`getBlob` and `setBlob` allow a programmer to
access an SQL `BLOB` value.
The `Blob` interface provides methods for getting the
length of an SQL `BLOB` (Binary Large Object) value,
for materializing a `BLOB` value on the client, and for
determining the position of a pattern of bytes within a
`BLOB` value. In addition, this interface has methods for updating
a `BLOB` value.

All methods on the `Blob` interface must be fully implemented if the
JDBC driver supports the data type.

    throws [SQLException](SQLException.md "class in java.sql")

    Writes the given array of bytes to the `BLOB` value that

    value will be increased to accommodate the extra bytes.

    **Note:** If the value specified for `pos`
    is greater than the length+1 of the `BLOB` value then the
    behavior is undefined. Some JDBC drivers may throw an

    Writing starts at position `pos` in the `BLOB`
    value; `len` bytes from the given byte array are written.
    The array of bytes will overwrite the existing bytes
    in the `Blob` object starting at the position
    `pos`. If the end of the `Blob` value is reached
    while writing the array of bytes, then the length of the `Blob`
    value will be increased to accommodate the extra bytes.

    **Note:** If the value specified for `pos`
    is greater than the length+1 of the `BLOB` value then the
    behavior is undefined. Some JDBC drivers may throw an

    throws [SQLException](SQLException.md "class in java.sql")

    Retrieves a stream that can be used to write to the `BLOB`
    value that this `Blob` object represents. The stream begins
    at position `pos`.
    The bytes written to the stream will overwrite the existing bytes
    in the `Blob` object starting at the position
    `pos`. If the end of the `Blob` value is reached
    while writing to the stream, then the length of the `Blob`
    value will be increased to accommodate the extra bytes.

    **Note:** If the value specified for `pos`
    is greater than the length+1 of the `BLOB` value then the
    behavior is undefined. Some JDBC drivers may throw an
    `SQLException` while other drivers may support this
    operation.

  + ### truncate

    void truncate(long len)
    throws [SQLException](SQLException.md "class in java.sql")

    Truncates the `BLOB` value that this `Blob`
    object represents to be `len` bytes in length.

    **Note:** If the value specified for `pos`
    is greater than the length+1 of the `BLOB` value then the

    `SQLException` while other drivers may support this
    operation.

    Parameters:
    :   `len` - the length, in bytes, to which the `BLOB` value
        that this `Blob` object represents should be truncated

    Throws:
    :   `SQLException` - if there is an error accessing the

  + ### free

    void free()
    throws [SQLException](SQLException.md "class in java.sql")

    This method frees the `Blob` object and releases the resources that
    it holds. The object is invalid once the `free`
    method is called.

    After `free` has been called, any attempt to invoke a
    method other than `free` will result in an `SQLException`
    being thrown. If `free` is called multiple times, the subsequent
    calls to `free` are treated as a no-op.

    Throws:

    throws [SQLException](SQLException.md "class in java.sql")

    Returns an `InputStream` object that contains
    a partial `Blob` value, starting with the byte
    specified by pos, which is length bytes in length.

    :   `SQLException` - if pos is less than 1 or if pos is greater
        than the number of bytes in the `Blob` or if
        pos + length is greater than the number of bytes
