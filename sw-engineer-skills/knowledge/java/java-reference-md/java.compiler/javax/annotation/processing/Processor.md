public interface Processor

The interface for an annotation processor.

Annotation processing happens in a sequence of [rounds](RoundEnvironment.md "interface in javax.annotation.processing"). On each
round, a processor may be asked to [process](#process(java.util.Set,javax.annotation.processing.RoundEnvironment)) a
subset of the annotations found on the source and class files
produced by a prior round. The inputs to the first round of
processing are the initial inputs to a run of the tool; these
initial inputs can be regarded as the output of a virtual zeroth
round of processing. If a processor was asked to process on a
given round, it will be asked to process on subsequent rounds,
including the last round, even if there are no annotations for it
to process. The tool infrastructure may also ask a processor to
process files generated implicitly by the tool's operation.

Each implementation of a `Processor` must provide a
public no-argument constructor to be used by tools to instantiate
the processor. The tool infrastructure will interact with classes
implementing this interface as follows:

1. If an existing `Processor` object is not being used, to
   create an instance of a processor the tool calls the no-arg
   constructor of the processor class.- Next, the tool calls the [`init`](#init(javax.annotation.processing.ProcessingEnvironment)) method with
     an appropriate [`ProcessingEnvironment`](ProcessingEnvironment.md "interface in javax.annotation.processing").- Afterwards, the tool calls [`getSupportedAnnotationTypes`](#getSupportedAnnotationTypes()), [`getSupportedOptions`](#getSupportedOptions()), and [`getSupportedSourceVersion`](#getSupportedSourceVersion()). These methods are only called once per
       run, not on each round.- As appropriate, the tool calls the [`process`](#process(java.util.Set,javax.annotation.processing.RoundEnvironment))
         method on the `Processor` object; a new `Processor`
         object is *not* created for each round.

If a processor object is created and used without the above
protocol being followed, then the processor's behavior is not
defined by this interface specification.

The tool uses a *discovery process* to find annotation
processors and decide whether or not they should be run. By
configuring the tool, the set of potential processors can be
controlled. For example, for a [`JavaCompiler`](../../tools/JavaCompiler.md "interface in javax.tools") the list of candidate processors to run can be
[set directly](../../tools/JavaCompiler.CompilationTask.md#setProcessors(java.lang.Iterable)) or controlled by a [search path](../../tools/StandardLocation.md#ANNOTATION_PROCESSOR_PATH)
used for a [service-style](../../../../java.base/java/util/ServiceLoader.md "class in java.util")
lookup. Other tool implementations may have different
configuration mechanisms, such as command line options; for
details, refer to the particular tool's documentation. Which
processors the tool asks to [run](#process(java.util.Set,javax.annotation.processing.RoundEnvironment)) is a function
of the interfaces of the annotations *[present](../../lang/model/AnnotatedConstruct.md "interface in javax.lang.model")* on the [root elements](RoundEnvironment.md#getRootElements()), what [annotation interfaces a processor
supports](#getSupportedAnnotationTypes()), and whether or not a processor [claims the annotation interfaces it processes](#process(java.util.Set,javax.annotation.processing.RoundEnvironment)). A processor will
be asked to process a subset of the annotation interfaces it
supports, possibly an empty set.
For a given round, the tool computes the set of annotation
interfaces that are present on the elements enclosed within the
root elements. If there is at least one annotation interface
present, then as processors claim annotation interfaces, they are
removed from the set of unmatched annotation interfaces. When the
set is empty or no more processors are available, the round has run
to completion. If there are no annotation interfaces present,
annotation processing still occurs but only *universal
processors* which support processing all annotation interfaces,
`"*"`, can claim the (empty) set of annotation interfaces.

An annotation interface is considered present if there is at least
one annotation of that interface present on an element enclosed within
the root elements of a round. For this purpose, a type parameter is
considered to be enclosed by its [generic
element](../../lang/model/element/TypeParameterElement.md#getGenericElement()).
For this purpose, a package element is *not* considered to
enclose the top-level classes and interfaces within that
package. (A root element representing a package is created when a
`package-info` file is processed.) Likewise, for this
purpose, a module element is *not* considered to enclose the
packages within that module. (A root element representing a module
is created when a `module-info` file is processed.)
Annotations on [type uses](../../../../java.base/java/lang/annotation/ElementType.md#TYPE_USE), as opposed to
annotations on elements, are ignored when computing whether or not
an annotation interface is present.

An annotation is *present* if it meets the definition of being
present given in [`AnnotatedConstruct`](../../lang/model/AnnotatedConstruct.md "interface in javax.lang.model"). In brief, an
annotation is considered present for the purposes of discovery if
it is directly present or present via inheritance. An annotation is
*not* considered present by virtue of being wrapped by a
container annotation. Operationally, this is equivalent to an
annotation being present on an element if and only if it would be
included in the results of [`Elements.getAllAnnotationMirrors(Element)`](../../lang/model/util/Elements.md#getAllAnnotationMirrors(javax.lang.model.element.Element)) called on that element. Since
annotations inside container annotations are not considered
present, to properly process [repeatable annotation interfaces](../../../../java.base/java/lang/annotation/Repeatable.md "annotation interface in java.lang.annotation"),
processors are advised to include both the repeatable annotation
interface and its containing annotation interface in the set of [supported annotation interfaces](#getSupportedAnnotationTypes()) of a
processor.

Note that if a processor supports `"*"` and returns `true`, all annotations are claimed. Therefore, a universal
processor being used to, for example, implement additional validity
checks should return `false` so as to not prevent other such
checkers from being able to run.

If a processor throws an uncaught exception, the tool may cease
other active annotation processors. If a processor raises an
error, the current round will run to completion and the subsequent
round will indicate an [error was raised](RoundEnvironment.md#errorRaised()). Since annotation processors are run in a
cooperative environment, a processor should throw an uncaught
exception only in situations where no error recovery or reporting
is feasible.

The tool environment is not required to support annotation
processors that access environmental resources, either [per round](RoundEnvironment.md "interface in javax.annotation.processing") or [cross-round](ProcessingEnvironment.md "interface in javax.annotation.processing"), in a multi-threaded fashion.

If the methods that return configuration information about the
annotation processor return `null`, return other invalid
input, or throw an exception, the tool infrastructure must treat
this as an error condition.

To be robust when running in different tool implementations, an
annotation processor should have the following properties:

1. The result of processing a given input is not a function of the presence or absence
   of other inputs (orthogonality).- Processing the same input produces the same output (consistency).- Processing input *A* followed by processing input *B*
       is equivalent to processing *B* then *A*
       (commutativity)- Processing an input does not rely on the presence of the output
         of other annotation processors (independence)

The [`Filer`](Filer.md "interface in javax.annotation.processing") interface discusses restrictions on how
processors can operate on files.

* ## Method Details

  + ### getSupportedOptions

    [Set](../../../../java.base/java/util/Set.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> getSupportedOptions()

    Returns the options recognized by this processor. An
    implementation of the processing tool must provide a way to
    pass processor-specific options distinctly from options passed
    to the tool itself, see [`getOptions`](ProcessingEnvironment.md#getOptions()).

    Each string returned in the set must be a period separated
    sequence of [identifiers](../../lang/model/SourceVersion.md#isIdentifier(java.lang.CharSequence)):
    > *SupportedOptionString:*: *Identifiers* *Identifiers:*: *Identifier*: *Identifier* `.` *Identifiers* *Identifier:*: Syntactic identifier, including keywords and literals

    A tool might use this information to determine if any
    options provided by a user are unrecognized by any processor,
    in which case it may wish to report a warning.

    Returns:
    :   the options recognized by this processor or an
        empty set if none

    See Also:
    :   - [`SupportedOptions`](SupportedOptions.md "annotation interface in javax.annotation.processing")
  + ### getSupportedAnnotationTypes

    [Set](../../../../java.base/java/util/Set.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> getSupportedAnnotationTypes()

    Returns the names of the annotation interfaces supported by this
    processor. An element of the result may be the canonical
    (fully qualified) name of a supported annotation interface.
    Alternately it may be of the form "`name.*`"
    representing the set of all annotation interfaces with canonical
    names beginning with "`name.`".
    In either of those cases, the name of the annotation interface can
    be optionally preceded by a module name followed by a `"/"` character. For example, if a processor supports `"a.B"`, this can include multiple annotation interfaces named `a.B` which reside in different modules. To only support `a.B` in the `foo` module, instead use `"foo/a.B"`.
    If a module name is included, only an annotation in that module
    is matched. In particular, if a module name is given in an
    environment where modules are not supported, such as an
    annotation processing environment configured for a [source version](ProcessingEnvironment.md#getSourceVersion()) without modules, then the annotation interfaces with
    a module name do *not* match.
    Finally, `"*"` by itself represents the set of all
    annotation interfaces, including the empty set. Note that a
    processor should not claim `"*"` unless it is actually
    processing all files; claiming unnecessary annotations may
    cause a performance slowdown in some environments.

    Each string returned in the set must be accepted by the
    following grammar:
    > *SupportedAnnotationTypeString:*: *ModulePrefix**opt* *TypeName* *DotStar**opt*: `*` *ModulePrefix:*: *ModuleName* `/` *DotStar:*: `.` `*`

    where *TypeName* and *ModuleName* are as defined in
    The Java Language Specification
    ().

    Returns:
    :   the names of the annotation interfaces supported by this processor
        or an empty set if none

  + ### getSupportedSourceVersion

    [SourceVersion](../../lang/model/SourceVersion.md "enum class in javax.lang.model") getSupportedSourceVersion()

    Returns the latest source version supported by this annotation
    processor.

    Returns:
    :   the latest source version supported by this annotation
        processor

    See Also:
    :   - [`SupportedSourceVersion`](SupportedSourceVersion.md "annotation interface in javax.annotation.processing")
        - [`ProcessingEnvironment.getSourceVersion()`](ProcessingEnvironment.md#getSourceVersion())
  + ### init

    void init([ProcessingEnvironment](ProcessingEnvironment.md "interface in javax.annotation.processing") processingEnv)

    Initializes the processor with the processing environment.

    Parameters:
    :   `processingEnv` - environment for facilities the tool framework
        provides to the processor
  + ### process

    boolean process([Set](../../../../java.base/java/util/Set.md "interface in java.util")<? extends [TypeElement](../../lang/model/element/TypeElement.md "interface in javax.lang.model.element")> annotations,
    [RoundEnvironment](RoundEnvironment.md "interface in javax.annotation.processing") roundEnv)

    Processes a set of annotation interfaces on [root elements](RoundEnvironment.md#getRootElements()) originating
    from the prior round and returns whether or not these
    annotation interfaces are claimed by this processor. If `true` is returned, the annotation interfaces are claimed and
    subsequent processors will not be asked to process them; if
    `false` is returned, the annotation interfaces are
    unclaimed and subsequent processors may be asked to process
    them. A processor may always return the same boolean value or
    may vary the result based on its own chosen criteria.

    The input set will be empty if the processor supports `"*"` and the root elements have no annotations. A `Processor` must gracefully handle an empty set of annotations.

    Parameters:
    :   `annotations` - the annotation interfaces requested to be processed
    :   `roundEnv` - environment for information about the current and prior round

    Returns:
    :   whether or not the set of annotation interfaces are claimed by this processor
  + ### getCompletions

    [Iterable](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Iterable.md "interface in java.lang")<? extends [Completion](Completion.md "interface in javax.annotation.processing")> getCompletions([Element](../../lang/model/element/Element.md "interface in javax.lang.model.element") element,
    [AnnotationMirror](../../lang/model/element/AnnotationMirror.md "interface in javax.lang.model.element") annotation,
    [ExecutableElement](../../lang/model/element/ExecutableElement.md "interface in javax.lang.model.element") member,
    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") userText)

    Returns to the tool infrastructure an iterable of suggested
    completions to an annotation. Since completions are being asked
    for, the information provided about the annotation may be
    incomplete, as if for a source code fragment. A processor may
    return an empty iterable. Annotation processors should focus
    their efforts on providing completions for annotation members
    with additional validity constraints known to the processor, for
    example an `int` member whose value should lie between 1
    and 10 or a string member that should be recognized by a known
    grammar, such as a regular expression or a URL.

    Since incomplete programs are being modeled, some of the
    parameters may only have partial information or may be `null`. At least one of `element` and `userText`
    must be non-`null`. If `element` is non-`null`,
    `annotation` and `member` may be `null`. Processors may not throw a `NullPointerException`
    if some parameters are `null`; if a processor has no
    completions to offer based on the provided information, an
    empty iterable can be returned. The processor may also return
    a single completion with an empty value string and a message
    describing why there are no completions.

    Completions are informative and may reflect additional
    validity checks performed by annotation processors. For
    example, consider the simple annotation:
    > ```
    >  @MersennePrime {
    >     int value();
    >  }
    > ```

    (A Mersenne prime is prime number of the form
    2*n* - 1.) Given an `AnnotationMirror`
    for this annotation interface, a list of all such primes in the
    `int` range could be returned without examining any other
    arguments to `getCompletions`:
    > ```
    >  import static javax.annotation.processing.Completions.*;
    >  ...
    >  return List.of(of("3"),
    >                 of("7"),
    >                 of("31"),
    >                 of("127"),
    >                 of("8191"),
    >                 of("131071"),
    >                 of("524287"),
    >                 of("2147483647"));
    > ```

    A more informative set of completions would include the number
    of each prime:
    > ```
    >  return List.of(of("3",          "M2"),
    >                 of("7",          "M3"),
    >                 of("31",         "M5"),
    >                 of("127",        "M7"),
    >                 of("8191",       "M13"),
    >                 of("131071",     "M17"),
    >                 of("524287",     "M19"),
    >                 of("2147483647", "M31"));
    > ```

    However, if the `userText` is available, it can be checked
    to see if only a subset of the Mersenne primes are valid. For
    example, if the user has typed
    > `@MersennePrime(1`

    the value of `userText` will be `"1"`; and only
    two of the primes are possible completions:
    > ```
    >  return Arrays.asList(of("127",        "M7"),
    >                       of("131071",     "M17"));
    > ```

    Sometimes no valid completion is possible. For example, there
    is no in-range Mersenne prime starting with 9:
    > `@MersennePrime(9`

    An appropriate response in this case is to either return an
    empty list of completions,
    > ```
    >  return Collections.emptyList();
    > ```

    or a single empty completion with a helpful message
    > ```
    >  return Arrays.asList(of("", "No in-range Mersenne primes start with 9"));
    > ```

    Parameters:
    :   `element` - the element being annotated
    :   `annotation` - the (perhaps partial) annotation being
        applied to the element
    :   `member` - the annotation member to return possible completions for
    :   `userText` - source code text to be completed

    Returns:
    :   suggested completions to the annotation
