public class ObjectName
extends [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Comparable](../../../java.base/java/lang/Comparable.md "interface in java.lang")<[ObjectName](ObjectName.md "class in javax.management")>, [QueryExp](QueryExp.md "interface in javax.management")

Represents the object name of an MBean, or a pattern that can
match the names of several MBeans. Instances of this class are
immutable.

An instance of this class can be used to represent:

* An object name
* An object name pattern, within the context of a query

An object name consists of two parts, the domain and the key
properties.

The *domain* is a string of characters not including
the character colon (`:`). It is recommended that the domain
should not contain the string "`//`", which is reserved for future use.

If the domain includes at least one occurrence of the wildcard
characters asterisk (`*`) or question mark
(`?`), then the object name is a pattern. The asterisk
matches any sequence of zero or more characters, while the question
mark matches any single character.

If the domain is empty, it will be replaced in certain contexts
by the *default domain* of the MBean server in which the
ObjectName is used.

The *key properties* are an unordered set of keys and
associated values.

Each *key* is a nonempty string of characters which may
not contain any of the characters comma (`,`), equals
(`=`), colon, asterisk, or question mark. The same key
may not occur twice in a given ObjectName.

Each *value* associated with a key is a string of
characters that is either unquoted or quoted.

An *unquoted value* is a possibly empty string of
characters which may not contain any of the characters comma,
equals, colon, or quote.

If the *unquoted value* contains at least one occurrence
of the wildcard characters asterisk or question mark, then the object
name is a *property value pattern*. The asterisk matches any
sequence of zero or more characters, while the question mark matches
any single character.

A *quoted value* consists of a quote (`"`),
followed by a possibly empty string of characters, followed by
another quote. Within the string of characters, the backslash
(`\`) has a special meaning. It must be followed by
one of the following characters:

* Another backslash. The second backslash has no special
  meaning and the two characters represent a single backslash.
* The character 'n'. The two characters represent a newline
  ('\n' in Java).
* A quote. The two characters represent a quote, and that quote
  is not considered to terminate the quoted value. An ending closing
  quote must be present for the quoted value to be valid.
* A question mark (?) or asterisk (\*). The two characters represent
  a question mark or asterisk respectively.

A quote may not appear inside a quoted value except immediately
after an odd number of consecutive backslashes.

The quotes surrounding a quoted value, and any backslashes
within that value, are considered to be part of the value.

If the *quoted value* contains at least one occurrence of
the characters asterisk or question mark and they are not preceded
by a backslash, then they are considered as wildcard characters and
the object name is a *property value pattern*. The asterisk
matches any sequence of zero or more characters, while the question
mark matches any single character.

An ObjectName may be a *property list pattern*. In this
case it may have zero or more keys and associated values. It matches
a nonpattern ObjectName whose domain matches and that contains the
same keys and associated values, as well as possibly other keys and
values.

An ObjectName is a *property value pattern* when at least
one of its *quoted* or *unquoted* key property values
contains the wildcard characters asterisk or question mark as described
above. In this case it has one or more keys and associated values, with
at least one of the values containing wildcard characters. It matches a
nonpattern ObjectName whose domain matches and that contains the same
keys whose values match; if the property value pattern is also a
property list pattern then the nonpattern ObjectName can contain
other keys and values.

An ObjectName is a *property pattern* if it is either a
*property list pattern* or a *property value pattern*
or both.

An ObjectName is a pattern if its domain contains a wildcard or
if the ObjectName is a property pattern.

If an ObjectName is not a pattern, it must contain at least one
key with its associated value.

Examples of ObjectName patterns are:

* `*:type=Foo,name=Bar` to match names in any domain whose
  exact set of keys is `type=Foo,name=Bar`.
* `d:type=Foo,name=Bar,*` to match names in the domain
  `d` that have the keys `type=Foo,name=Bar` plus
  zero or more other keys.
* `*:type=Foo,name=Bar,*` to match names in any domain
  that has the keys `type=Foo,name=Bar` plus zero or
  more other keys.
* `d:type=F?o,name=Bar` will match e.g.
  `d:type=Foo,name=Bar` and `d:type=Fro,name=Bar`.
* `d:type=F*o,name=Bar` will match e.g.
  `d:type=Fo,name=Bar` and `d:type=Frodo,name=Bar`.
* `d:type=Foo,name="B*"` will match e.g.
  `d:type=Foo,name="Bling"`. Wildcards are recognized even
  inside quotes, and like other special characters can be escaped
  with `\`.

An ObjectName can be written as a String with the following
elements in order:

* The domain.* A colon (`:`).* A key property list as defined below.

A key property list written as a String is a comma-separated
list of elements. Each element is either an asterisk or a key
property. A key property consists of a key, an equals
(`=`), and the associated value.

At most one element of a key property list may be an asterisk.
If the key property list contains an asterisk element, the
ObjectName is a property list pattern.

Spaces have no special significance in a String representing an
ObjectName. For example, the String:

```
 domain: key1 = value1 , key2 = value2
```

represents an ObjectName with two keys. The name of each key
contains six characters, of which the first and last are spaces.
The value associated with the key `" key1 "`
also begins and ends with a space.

In addition to the restrictions on characters spelt out above,
no part of an ObjectName may contain a newline character
(`'\n'`), whether the domain, a key, or a value, whether
quoted or unquoted. The newline character can be represented in a
quoted value with the sequence `\n`.

The rules on special characters and quoting apply regardless of
which constructor is used to make an ObjectName.

To avoid collisions between MBeans supplied by different
vendors, a useful convention is to begin the domain name with the
reverse DNS name of the organization that specifies the MBeans,
followed by a period and a string whose interpretation is
determined by that organization. For example, MBeans specified by
`example.com` would have
domains such as `com.example.MyDomain`. This is essentially
the same convention as for Java-language package names.

The **serialVersionUID** of this class is `1081892073854801359L`.

    twice with the same parameters may return the same object or
    two equal but not identical objects.

    Parameters:
    :   `domain` - The domain part of the object name.
    :   `table` - A hash table containing one or more key
        properties. The key of each entry in the table is the key of a

    :   `NullPointerException` - One of the parameters is null.
  + ### getInstance

    public static [ObjectName](ObjectName.md "class in javax.management") getInstance([ObjectName](ObjectName.md "class in javax.management") name)

    Return an instance of ObjectName that can be used anywhere
    the given object can be used. The returned object may be of a
    subclass of ObjectName. If `name` is of a subclass
    of ObjectName, it is not guaranteed that the returned object
    will be of the same class.

    The returned value may or may not be identical to
    `name`. Calling this method twice with the same
    parameters may return the same object or two equal but not
    identical objects.

    Since ObjectName is immutable, it is not usually useful to
    make a copy of an ObjectName. The principal use of this method
    is to guard against a malicious caller who might pass an
    instance of a subclass with surprising behavior to sensitive
    code. Such code can call this method to obtain an ObjectName
    that is known not to have surprising behavior.

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - an instance of the ObjectName class or of a subclass

    Returns:
    :   an instance of ObjectName or a subclass that is known to
        have the same semantics. If `name` respects the
        semantics of ObjectName, then the returned object is equal
        (though not necessarily identical) to `name`.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - The `name` is null.
  + ### isPattern

    public boolean isPattern()

    Checks whether the object name is a pattern.

    An object name is a pattern if its domain contains a
    wildcard or if the object name is a property pattern.

    Returns:
    :   True if the name is a pattern, otherwise false.
  + ### isDomainPattern

    public boolean isDomainPattern()

    Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the domain part.

    Returns:
    :   True if the name is a domain pattern, otherwise false.
  + ### isPropertyPattern

    public boolean isPropertyPattern()

    Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the key properties.

    An object name is a pattern on the key properties if it is a
    pattern on the key property list (e.g. "d:k=v,\*") or on the
    property values (e.g. "d:k=\*") or on both (e.g. "d:k=\*,\*").

    Returns:
    :   True if the name is a property pattern, otherwise false.
  + ### isPropertyListPattern

    public boolean isPropertyListPattern()

    Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the key property list.

    For example, "d:k=v,\*" and "d:k=\*,\*" are key property list patterns
    whereas "d:k=\*" is not.

    Returns:
    :   True if the name is a property list pattern, otherwise false.

    Since:
    :   1.6
  + ### isPropertyValuePattern

    public boolean isPropertyValuePattern()

    Checks whether the object name is a pattern on the value part
    of at least one of the key properties.

    For example, "d:k=\*" and "d:k=\*,\*" are property value patterns
    whereas "d:k=v,\*" is not.

    Returns:
    :   True if the name is a property value pattern, otherwise false.

    Since:
    :   1.6
  + ### isPropertyValuePattern

    public boolean isPropertyValuePattern([String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") property)

    Checks whether the value associated with a key in a key
    property is a pattern.

    Parameters:
    :   `property` - The property whose value is to be checked.

    Returns:
    :   True if the value associated with the given key property
        is a pattern, otherwise false.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - If `property` is null.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - If `property` is not
        a valid key property for this ObjectName.

    Since:
    :   1.6
  + ### getCanonicalName

    public [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getCanonicalName()

    Returns the canonical form of the name; that is, a string
    representation where the properties are sorted in lexical
    order.

    More precisely, the canonical form of the name is a String
    consisting of the *domain part*, a colon
    (`:`), the *canonical key property list*, and
    a *pattern indication*.

    The *canonical key property list* is the same string
    as described for [`getCanonicalKeyPropertyListString()`](#getCanonicalKeyPropertyListString()).

    The *pattern indication* is:
    - empty for an ObjectName
      that is not a property list pattern;- an asterisk for an ObjectName
        that is a property list pattern with no keys; or- a comma and an
          asterisk (`,*`) for an ObjectName that is a property
          list pattern with at least one key.

    Returns:
    :   The canonical form of the name.
  + ### getDomain

    public [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getDomain()

    Returns the domain part.

    Returns:
    :   The domain.

    Obtains the value associated with a key in a key property.

    Parameters:
    :   `property` - The property whose value is to be obtained.

    Returns:
    :   The value of the property, or null if there is no such
        property in this ObjectName.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - If `property` is null.
  + ### getKeyPropertyList

    public [Hashtable](../../../java.base/java/util/Hashtable.md "class in java.util")<[String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang"),[String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> getKeyPropertyList()

    Returns the key properties as a Hashtable. The returned
    value is a Hashtable in which each key is a key in the
    ObjectName's key property list and each value is the associated
    value.

    The returned value may be unmodifiable. If it is
    modifiable, changing it has no effect on this ObjectName.

    Returns:
    :   The table of key properties.
  + ### getKeyPropertyListString

    public [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getKeyPropertyListString()

    Returns a string representation of the list of key
    properties specified at creation time. If this ObjectName was
    constructed with the constructor [`ObjectName(String)`](#%3Cinit%3E(java.lang.String)),
    the key properties in the returned String will be in the same
    order as in the argument to the constructor.

    Returns:
    :   The key property list string. This string is
        independent of whether the ObjectName is a pattern.
  + ### getCanonicalKeyPropertyListString

    public [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getCanonicalKeyPropertyListString()

    Returns a string representation of the list of key properties,
    in which the key properties are sorted in lexical order. This
    is used in lexicographic comparisons performed in order to
    select MBeans based on their key property list. Lexical order
    is the order implied by [`String.compareTo(String)`](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md#compareTo(java.lang.String)).

    Returns:
    :   The canonical key property list string. This string is
        independent of whether the ObjectName is a pattern.
  + ### toString

    public [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Returns a string representation of the object name. The
    format of this string is not specified, but users can expect
    that two ObjectNames return the same string if and only if they
    are equal.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a string representation of this object name.
  + ### equals

    public boolean equals([Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") object)

    Compares the current object name with another object name. Two
    ObjectName instances are equal if and only if their canonical
    forms are equal. The canonical form is the string described
    for [`getCanonicalName()`](#getCanonicalName()).

    Overrides:
    :   `equals` in class `Object`

    Parameters:
    :   `object` - The object name that the current object name is to be
        compared with.

    Returns:
    :   True if `object` is an ObjectName whose
        canonical form is equal to that of this ObjectName.

        - [`HashMap`](../../../java.base/java/util/HashMap.md "class in java.util")
  + ### hashCode

    public int hashCode()

    Returns a hash code for this object name.

    Overrides:
    :   `hashCode` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a hash code value for this object.

    See Also:
    :   - [`Object.equals(java.lang.Object)`](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md#equals(java.lang.Object))
        - [`System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)`](../../../java.base/java/lang/System.md#identityHashCode(java.lang.Object))
  + ### quote

    public static [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") quote([String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") s)

    Returns a quoted form of the given String, suitable for
    inclusion in an ObjectName. The returned value can be used as
    the value associated with a key in an ObjectName. The String
    `s` may contain any character. Appropriate quoting
    ensures that the returned value is legal in an ObjectName.

    The returned value consists of a quote ('"'), a sequence of
    characters corresponding to the characters of `s`,
    and another quote. Characters in `s` appear
    unchanged within the returned value except:

    - A quote ('"') is replaced by a backslash (\) followed by a quote.
    - An asterisk ('\*') is replaced by a backslash (\) followed by an
      asterisk.
    - A question mark ('?') is replaced by a backslash (\) followed by
      a question mark.
    - A backslash ('\') is replaced by two backslashes.
    - A newline character (the character '\n' in Java) is replaced
      by a backslash followed by the character '\n'.

    Parameters:
    :   `s` - the String to be quoted.

    Returns:
    :   the quoted String.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `s` is null.
  + ### unquote

    public static [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") unquote([String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") q)

    Returns an unquoted form of the given String. If
    `q` is a String returned by [`quote(s)`](#quote(java.lang.String)),
    then `unquote(q).equals(s)`. If there is no String
    `s` for which `quote(s).equals(q)`, then
    unquote(q) throws an IllegalArgumentException.

    These rules imply that there is a one-to-one mapping between
    quoted and unquoted forms.

    Parameters:
    :   `q` - the String to be unquoted.

    Returns:
    :   the unquoted String.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `q` could not
        have been returned by the [`quote(java.lang.String)`](#quote(java.lang.String)) method, for instance
        if it does not begin and end with a quote (").
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `q` is null.
  + ### apply

    public boolean apply([ObjectName](ObjectName.md "class in javax.management") name)

    Test whether this ObjectName, which may be a pattern,
    matches another ObjectName. If `name` is a pattern,
    the result is false. If this ObjectName is a pattern, the
    result is true if and only if `name` matches the
    pattern. If neither this ObjectName nor `name` is
    a pattern, the result is true if and only if the two
    ObjectNames are equal as described for the [`equals(Object)`](#equals(java.lang.Object)) method.

    Specified by:
    :   `apply` in interface `QueryExp`

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - The name of the MBean to compare to.

    Returns:
    :   True if `name` matches this ObjectName.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `name` is null.
  + ### setMBeanServer

    public void setMBeanServer([MBeanServer](MBeanServer.md "interface in javax.management") mbs)

    Description copied from interface: `QueryExp`

    Sets the MBean server on which the query is to be performed.

    Specified by:
    :   `setMBeanServer` in interface `QueryExp`

    Parameters:
    :   `mbs` - The MBean server on which the query is to be performed.
  + ### compareTo

    public int compareTo([ObjectName](ObjectName.md "class in javax.management") name)

    Compares two ObjectName instances. The ordering relation between
    ObjectNames is not completely specified but is intended to be such
    that a sorted list of ObjectNames will appear in an order that is
    convenient for a person to read.

    In particular, if the two ObjectName instances have different
    domains then their order is the lexicographical order of the domains.
    The ordering of the key property list remains unspecified.

    For example, the ObjectName instances below:

    - Shapes:type=Square,name=3
    - Colors:type=Red,name=2
    - Shapes:type=Triangle,side=isosceles,name=2
    - Colors:type=Red,name=1
    - Shapes:type=Square,name=1
    - Colors:type=Blue,name=1
    - Shapes:type=Square,name=2
    - JMImplementation:type=MBeanServerDelegate
    - Shapes:type=Triangle,side=scalene,name=1

    could be ordered as follows:

    - Colors:type=Blue,name=1
    - Colors:type=Red,name=1
    - Colors:type=Red,name=2
    - JMImplementation:type=MBeanServerDelegate
    - Shapes:type=Square,name=1
    - Shapes:type=Square,name=2
    - Shapes:type=Square,name=3
    - Shapes:type=Triangle,side=scalene,name=1
    - Shapes:type=Triangle,side=isosceles,name=2

    Specified by:
    :   `compareTo` in interface `Comparable<ObjectName>`

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - the ObjectName to be compared.

    Returns:
    :   a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this
        ObjectName is less than, equal to, or greater than the
        specified ObjectName.
