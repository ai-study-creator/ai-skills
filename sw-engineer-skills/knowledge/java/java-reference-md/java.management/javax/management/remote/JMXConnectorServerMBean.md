# Interface JMXConnectorServerMBean

All Known Implementing Classes:
:   `JMXConnectorServer`, `RMIConnectorServer`

---

public interface JMXConnectorServerMBean

MBean interface for connector servers. A JMX API connector server
is attached to an MBean server, and establishes connections to that
MBean server for remote clients.

A newly-created connector server is *inactive*, and does
not yet listen for connections. Only when its [`start`](#start())
method has been called does it start listening for connections.

Since:
:   1.5

* ## Method Details

  + ### start

    void start()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Activates the connector server, that is, starts listening for
    client connections. Calling this method when the connector
    server is already active has no effect. Calling this method
    when the connector server has been stopped will generate an
    [`IOException`](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io").

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if it is not possible to start listening
        or if the connector server has been stopped.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the connector server has
        not been attached to an MBean server.
  + ### stop

    void stop()
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Deactivates the connector server, that is, stops listening for
    client connections. Calling this method will also close all
    client connections that were made by this server. After this
    method returns, whether normally or with an exception, the
    connector server will not create any new client
    connections.

    Once a connector server has been stopped, it cannot be started
    again.

    Calling this method when the connector server has already
    been stopped has no effect. Calling this method when the
    connector server has not yet been started will disable the
    connector server object permanently.

    If closing a client connection produces an exception, that
    exception is not thrown from this method. A [`JMXConnectionNotification`](JMXConnectionNotification.md "class in javax.management.remote") with type [`JMXConnectionNotification.FAILED`](JMXConnectionNotification.md#FAILED) is emitted from this MBean
    with the connection ID of the connection that could not be
    closed.

    Closing a connector server is a potentially slow operation.
    For example, if a client machine with an open connection has
    crashed, the close operation might have to wait for a network
    protocol timeout. Callers that do not want to block in a close
    operation should do it in a separate thread.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if the server cannot be closed cleanly.
        When this exception is thrown, the server has already attempted
        to close all client connections. All client connections are
        closed except possibly those that generated exceptions when the
        server attempted to close them.
  + ### isActive

    boolean isActive()

    Determines whether the connector server is active. A connector
    server starts being active when its [`start`](#start()) method
    returns successfully and remains active until either its
    [`stop`](#stop()) method is called or the connector server
    fails.

    Returns:
    :   true if the connector server is active.
  + ### setMBeanServerForwarder

    void setMBeanServerForwarder([MBeanServerForwarder](MBeanServerForwarder.md "interface in javax.management.remote") mbsf)

    Inserts an object that intercepts requests for the MBean server
    that arrive through this connector server. This object will be
    supplied as the `MBeanServer` for any new connection
    created by this connector server. Existing connections are
    unaffected.

    This method can be called more than once with different
    [`MBeanServerForwarder`](MBeanServerForwarder.md "interface in javax.management.remote") objects. The result is a chain
    of forwarders. The last forwarder added is the first in the chain.
    In more detail:

    - If this connector server is already associated with an
      `MBeanServer` object, then that object is given to
      [`mbsf.setMBeanServer`](MBeanServerForwarder.md#setMBeanServer(javax.management.MBeanServer)). If doing so produces an exception, this
      method throws the same exception without any other effect.

      - If this connector is not already associated with an
        `MBeanServer` object, or if the
        `mbsf.setMBeanServer` call just mentioned succeeds,
        then `mbsf` becomes this connector server's
        `MBeanServer`.

    Parameters:
    :   `mbsf` - the new `MBeanServerForwarder`.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the call to [`mbsf.setMBeanServer`](MBeanServerForwarder.md#setMBeanServer(javax.management.MBeanServer)) fails
        with `IllegalArgumentException`. This includes the
        case where `mbsf` is null.
  + ### getConnectionIds

    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] getConnectionIds()

    The list of IDs for currently-open connections to this
    connector server.

    Returns:
    :   a new string array containing the list of IDs. If
        there are no currently-open connections, this array will be
        empty.
  + ### getAddress

    [JMXServiceURL](JMXServiceURL.md "class in javax.management.remote") getAddress()

    The address of this connector server.

    The address returned may not be the exact original [`JMXServiceURL`](JMXServiceURL.md "class in javax.management.remote")
    that was supplied when creating the connector server, since the original
    address may not always be complete. For example the port number may be
    dynamically allocated when starting the connector server. Instead the
    address returned is the actual [`JMXServiceURL`](JMXServiceURL.md "class in javax.management.remote") of the
    [`JMXConnectorServer`](JMXConnectorServer.md "class in javax.management.remote"). This is the address that clients supply
    to [`JMXConnectorFactory.connect(JMXServiceURL)`](JMXConnectorFactory.md#connect(javax.management.remote.JMXServiceURL)).

    Note that the address returned may be `null` if
    the `JMXConnectorServer` is not yet [`active`](#isActive()).

    Returns:
    :   the address of this connector server, or null if it
        does not have one.
  + ### getAttributes

    [Map](../../../../java.base/java/util/Map.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang"),?> getAttributes()

    The attributes for this connector server.

    Returns:
    :   a read-only map containing the attributes for this
        connector server. Attributes whose values are not serializable
        are omitted from this map. If there are no serializable
        attributes, the returned map is empty.
  + ### toJMXConnector

    [JMXConnector](JMXConnector.md "interface in javax.management.remote") toJMXConnector([Map](../../../../java.base/java/util/Map.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang"),?> env)
    throws [IOException](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Returns a client stub for this connector server. A client
    stub is a serializable object whose [`connect`](JMXConnector.md#connect(java.util.Map)) method can be used to make
    one new connection to this connector server.

    A given connector need not support the generation of client
    stubs. However, the connectors specified by the JMX Remote API do
    (JMXMP Connector and RMI Connector).

    Parameters:
    :   `env` - client connection parameters of the same sort that
        can be provided to [`JMXConnector.connect(Map)`](JMXConnector.md#connect(java.util.Map)). Can be null, which is equivalent
        to an empty map.

    Returns:
    :   a client stub that can be used to make a new connection
        to this connector server.

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if this connector
        server does not support the generation of client stubs.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the JMXConnectorServer is
        not started (see [`isActive()`](#isActive())).
    :   `IOException` - if a communications problem means that a
        stub cannot be created.
