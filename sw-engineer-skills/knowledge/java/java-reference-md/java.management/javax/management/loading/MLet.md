Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

This API is part of Management Applets (m-lets), which is a legacy feature that allows loading
of remote MBeans. This feature is not usable without a Security Manager, which is deprecated and subject to
removal in a future release. Consequently, this API is also deprecated and subject to removal. There is no replacement.

Allows you to instantiate and register one or several MBeans in the MBean server
coming from a remote URL. M-let is a shortcut for management applet. The m-let service does this
by loading an m-let text file, which specifies information on the MBeans to be obtained.
The information on each MBean is specified in a single instance of a tag, called the MLET tag.
The location of the m-let text file is specified by a URL.

The `MLET` tag has the following syntax:

<`MLET`  
`CODE =` class `| OBJECT =` serfile  
`ARCHIVE = "`archiveList`"`  
`[CODEBASE =` codebaseURL`]`  
`[NAME =` mbeanname`]`  
`[VERSION =` version`]`  
>  
`[`arglist`]`  
<`/MLET`>

where:

`CODE =` class
:   This attribute specifies the full Java class name, including package name, of the MBean to be obtained.
    The compiled `.class` file of the MBean must be contained in one of the `.jar` files specified by the `ARCHIVE`
    attribute. Either `CODE` or `OBJECT` must be present.

`OBJECT =` serfile
:   This attribute specifies the `.ser` file that contains a serialized representation of the MBean to be obtained.
    This file must be contained in one of the `.jar` files specified by the `ARCHIVE` attribute. If the `.jar` file contains a directory hierarchy, specify the path of the file within this hierarchy. Otherwise a match will not be found. Either `CODE` or `OBJECT` must be present.

`ARCHIVE = "`archiveList`"`
:   This mandatory attribute specifies one or more `.jar` files
    containing MBeans or other resources used by
    the MBean to be obtained. One of the `.jar` files must contain the file specified by the `CODE` or `OBJECT` attribute.
    If archivelist contains more than one file:

    * Each file must be separated from the one that follows it by a comma (,).* archivelist must be enclosed in double quote marks.

    All `.jar` files in archivelist must be stored in the directory specified by the code base URL.

`CODEBASE =` codebaseURL
:   This optional attribute specifies the code base URL of the MBean to be obtained. It identifies the directory that contains
    the `.jar` files specified by the `ARCHIVE` attribute. Specify this attribute only if the `.jar` files are not in the same
    directory as the m-let text file. If this attribute is not specified, the base URL of the m-let text file is used.

`NAME =` mbeanname
:   This optional attribute specifies the object name to be assigned to the
    MBean instance when the m-let service registers it. If
    mbeanname starts with the colon character (:), the domain
    part of the object name is the default domain of the MBean server,
    as returned by [`MBeanServer.getDefaultDomain()`](../MBeanServer.md#getDefaultDomain()).

`VERSION =` version
:   This optional attribute specifies the version number of the MBean and
    associated `.jar` files to be obtained. This version number can
    be used to specify that the `.jar` files are loaded from the
    server to update those stored locally in the cache the next time the m-let
    text file is loaded. version must be a series of non-negative
    decimal integers each separated by a period from the one that precedes it.

arglist
:   This optional attribute specifies a list of one or more parameters for the
    MBean to be instantiated. This list describes the parameters to be passed the MBean's constructor.
    Use the following syntax to specify each item in
    arglist:

    <`ARG TYPE=`argumentType `VALUE=`value>
    :   where:

        * argumentType is the type of the argument that will be passed as parameter to the MBean's constructor.

    The arguments' type in the argument list should be a Java primitive type or a Java basic type
    (`java.lang.Boolean, java.lang.Byte, java.lang.Short, java.lang.Long, java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Float, java.lang.Double, java.lang.String`).

When an m-let text file is loaded, an
instance of each MBean specified in the file is created and registered.

The m-let service extends the `java.net.URLClassLoader` and can be used to load remote classes
and jar files in the VM of the agent.

**Note -**  The `MLet` class loader uses the [`MBeanServerFactory.getClassLoaderRepository(javax.management.MBeanServer)`](../MBeanServerFactory.md#getClassLoaderRepository(javax.management.MBeanServer))
to load classes that could not be found in the loaded jar files.

:   1.5

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Save this MLet's contents to the given [`ObjectOutput`](../../../../java.base/java/io/ObjectOutput.md "interface in java.io").
    Not all implementations support this method. Those that do not
    throw [`UnsupportedOperationException`](../../../../java.base/java/lang/UnsupportedOperationException.md "class in java.lang"). A subclass may
    override this method to support it or to change the format of
    the written data.

    The format of the written data is not specified, but if
    an implementation supports [`writeExternal(java.io.ObjectOutput)`](#writeExternal(java.io.ObjectOutput)) it must
    also support [`readExternal(java.io.ObjectInput)`](#readExternal(java.io.ObjectInput)) in such a way that what is
    written by the former can be read by the latter.

    Specified by:
    :   `writeExternal` in interface `Externalizable`

    Parameters:
    :   `out` - The object output stream to write to.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If a problem occurred while writing.
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - If this
        implementation does not support this operation.

    Not all implementations support this method. Those that do not
    throw [`UnsupportedOperationException`](../../../../java.base/java/lang/UnsupportedOperationException.md "class in java.lang"). A subclass may
    override this method to support it or to change the format of
    the read data.

    The format of the read data is not specified, but if an
    implementation supports [`readExternal(java.io.ObjectInput)`](#readExternal(java.io.ObjectInput)) it must also
    support [`writeExternal(java.io.ObjectOutput)`](#writeExternal(java.io.ObjectOutput)) in such a way that what is
    written by the latter can be read by the former.

    Specified by:
    :   `readExternal` in interface `Externalizable`

    Parameters:
    :   `in` - The object input stream to read from.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if a problem occurred while reading.
    :   `ClassNotFoundException` - if the class for the object
        being restored cannot be found.

    public [Class](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<?> loadClass([String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name,
    [ClassLoaderRepository](ClassLoaderRepository.md "interface in javax.management.loading") clr)
    throws [ClassNotFoundException](../../../../java.base/java/lang/ClassNotFoundException.md "class in java.lang")

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Load a class, using the given [`ClassLoaderRepository`](ClassLoaderRepository.md "interface in javax.management.loading") if
    the class is not found in this MLet's URLs. The given
    ClassLoaderRepository can be null, in which case a [`ClassNotFoundException`](../../../../java.base/java/lang/ClassNotFoundException.md "class in java.lang") occurs immediately if the class is not
    found in this MLet's URLs.

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - The name of the class we want to load.
    :   `clr` - The ClassLoaderRepository that will be used to search
        for the given class, if it is not found in this
        ClassLoader. May be null.

    Returns:
    :   The resulting Class object.

    Throws:
    :   `ClassNotFoundException` - The specified class could not be
        found in this ClassLoader nor in the given
        ClassLoaderRepository.
  + ### findClass

    throws [ClassNotFoundException](../../../../java.base/java/lang/ClassNotFoundException.md "class in java.lang")

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    This is the main method for class loaders that is being redefined.

    Overrides:
    :   `findClass` in class `URLClassLoader`

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - The name of the class.

    Returns:
    :   The resulting Class object.

    Throws:
    :   `ClassNotFoundException` - The specified class could not be
        found.
  + ### findLibrary

    protected [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") findLibrary([String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") libname)

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Returns the absolute path name of a native library. The VM
    invokes this method to locate the native libraries that belong
    to classes loaded with this class loader. Libraries are
    searched in the JAR files using first just the native library
    name and if not found the native library name together with
    the architecture-specific path name
    (`OSName/OSArch/OSVersion/lib/nativelibname`), i.e.

    the library stat on Solaris SPARC 5.7 will be searched in the JAR file as:
    1. libstat.so+ SunOS/sparc/5.7/lib/libstat.sothe library stat on Windows NT 4.0 will be searched in the JAR file as:
    1. stat.dll+ WindowsNT/x86/4.0/lib/stat.dll

    More specifically, let *`nativelibname`* be the result of
    [`System.mapLibraryName`](../../../../java.base/java/lang/System.md#mapLibraryName(java.lang.String))`(libname)`. Then the following names are
    searched in the JAR files, in order:  
    *`nativelibname`*  
    `<os.name>/<os.arch>/<os.version>/lib/`*`nativelibname`*  
    where `<X>` means `System.getProperty(X)` with any
    spaces in the result removed, and `/` stands for the
    file separator character ([`File.separator`](../../../../java.base/java/io/File.md#separator)).

    If this method returns `null`, i.e. the libraries
    were not found in any of the JAR files loaded with this class
    loader, the VM searches the library along the path specified
    as the `java.library.path` property.

    Overrides:
    :   `findLibrary` in class `ClassLoader`

    Parameters:
    :   `libname` - The library name.

    Returns:
    :   The absolute path of the native library.

    This method is to be overridden when extending this service to
    support caching and versioning. It is called from [`getMBeansFromURL`](#getMBeansFromURL(java.net.URL)) when the version,
    codebase, and jarfile have been extracted from the MLet file,
    and can be used to verify that it is all right to load the
    given MBean, or to replace the given URL with a different one.

    The default implementation of this method returns
    `codebase` unchanged.

    Parameters:
    :   `version` - The version number of the `.jar`
        file stored locally.
    :   `codebase` - The base URL of the remote `.jar` file.
    :   `jarfile` - The name of the `.jar` file to be loaded.
    :   `mlet` - The `MLetContent` instance that
        represents the `MLET` tag.

    Returns:
    :   the codebase to use for the loaded MBean. The returned
        value should not be null.

    Throws:
    :   `Exception` - if the MBean is not to be loaded for some
        reason. The exception will be added to the set returned by
        [`getMBeansFromURL`](#getMBeansFromURL(java.net.URL)).
