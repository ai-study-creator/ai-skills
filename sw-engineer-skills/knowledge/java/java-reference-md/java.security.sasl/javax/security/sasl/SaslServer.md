# Interface SaslServer

---

public interface SaslServer

Performs SASL authentication as a server.

A server such an LDAP server gets an instance of this
class in order to perform authentication defined by a specific SASL
mechanism. Invoking methods on the `SaslServer` instance
generates challenges according to the SASL
mechanism implemented by the `SaslServer`.
As the authentication proceeds, the instance
encapsulates the state of a SASL server's authentication exchange.

Here's an example of how an LDAP server might use a `SaslServer`.
It first gets an instance of a `SaslServer` for the SASL mechanism
requested by the client:
> ```
>  SaslServer ss = Sasl.createSaslServer(mechanism,
>      "ldap", myFQDN, props, callbackHandler);
> ```

It can then proceed to use the server for authentication.
For example, suppose the LDAP server received an LDAP BIND request
containing the name of the SASL mechanism and an (optional) initial
response. It then might use the server as follows:
> ```
>  while (!ss.isComplete()) {
>      try {
>          byte[] challenge = ss.evaluateResponse(response);
>          if (ss.isComplete()) {
>              status = ldap.sendBindResponse(mechanism, challenge, SUCCESS);
>          } else {
>              status = ldap.sendBindResponse(mechanism, challenge,
>                  SASL_BIND_IN_PROGRESS);
>              response = ldap.readBindRequest();
>          }
>      } catch (SaslException e) {
>          status = ldap.sendErrorResponse(e);
>          break;
>      }
>  }
>  if (ss.isComplete() && status == SUCCESS) {
>      String qop = (String) sc.getNegotiatedProperty(Sasl.QOP);
>      if (qop != null
>          && (qop.equalsIgnoreCase("auth-int")
>              || qop.equalsIgnoreCase("auth-conf"))) {
>
>          // Use SaslServer.wrap() and SaslServer.unwrap() for future
>          // communication with client
>          ldap.in = new SecureInputStream(ss, ldap.in);
>          ldap.out = new SecureOutputStream(ss, ldap.out);
>      }
>  }
> ```

* ## Method Details

  + ### getMechanismName

    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getMechanismName()

    Returns the IANA-registered mechanism name of this SASL server.
    (e.g. "CRAM-MD5", "GSSAPI").

    Returns:
    :   A non-null string representing the IANA-registered mechanism name.
  + ### evaluateResponse

    byte[] evaluateResponse(byte[] response)
    throws [SaslException](SaslException.md "class in javax.security.sasl")

    Evaluates the response data and generates a challenge.
    If a response is received from the client during the authentication
    process, this method is called to prepare an appropriate next
    challenge to submit to the client. The challenge is null if the
    authentication has succeeded and no more challenge data is to be sent
    to the client. It is non-null if the authentication must be continued
    by sending a challenge to the client, or if the authentication has
    succeeded but challenge data needs to be processed by the client.
    `isComplete()` should be called
    after each call to `evaluateResponse()`, to determine if any further
    response is needed from the client.

    Parameters:
    :   `response` - The non-null (but possibly empty) response sent
        by the client.

    Returns:
    :   The possibly null challenge to send to the client.
        It is null if the authentication has succeeded and there is
        no more challenge data to be sent to the client.

    Throws:
    :   `SaslException` - If an error occurred while processing
        the response or generating a challenge.
  + ### isComplete

    boolean isComplete()

    Determines whether the authentication exchange has completed.
    This method is typically called after each invocation of
    `evaluateResponse()` to determine whether the
    authentication has completed successfully or should be continued.

    Returns:
    :   true if the authentication exchange has completed; false otherwise.
  + ### getAuthorizationID

    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getAuthorizationID()

    Reports the authorization ID in effect for the client of this
    session.
    This method can only be called if isComplete() returns true.

    Returns:
    :   The authorization ID of the client.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if this authentication session has not completed
  + ### unwrap

    byte[] unwrap(byte[] incoming,
    int offset,
    int len)
    throws [SaslException](SaslException.md "class in javax.security.sasl")

    Unwraps a byte array received from the client.
    This method can be called only after the authentication exchange has
    completed (i.e., when `isComplete()` returns true) and only if
    the authentication exchange has negotiated integrity and/or privacy
    as the quality of protection; otherwise,
    an `IllegalStateException` is thrown.

    `incoming` is the contents of the SASL buffer as defined in RFC 2222
    without the leading four octet field that represents the length.
    `offset` and `len` specify the portion of `incoming`
    to use.

    Parameters:
    :   `incoming` - A non-null byte array containing the encoded bytes
        from the client.
    :   `offset` - The starting position at `incoming` of the bytes to use.
    :   `len` - The number of bytes from `incoming` to use.

    Returns:
    :   A non-null byte array containing the decoded bytes.

    Throws:
    :   `SaslException` - if `incoming` cannot be successfully
        unwrapped.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the authentication exchange has
        not completed, or if the negotiated quality of protection
        has neither integrity nor privacy
  + ### wrap

    byte[] wrap(byte[] outgoing,
    int offset,
    int len)
    throws [SaslException](SaslException.md "class in javax.security.sasl")

    Wraps a byte array to be sent to the client.
    This method can be called only after the authentication exchange has
    completed (i.e., when `isComplete()` returns true) and only if
    the authentication exchange has negotiated integrity and/or privacy
    as the quality of protection; otherwise, a `SaslException` is thrown.

    The result of this method
    will make up the contents of the SASL buffer as defined in RFC 2222
    without the leading four octet field that represents the length.
    `offset` and `len` specify the portion of `outgoing`
    to use.

    Parameters:
    :   `outgoing` - A non-null byte array containing the bytes to encode.
    :   `offset` - The starting position at `outgoing` of the bytes to use.
    :   `len` - The number of bytes from `outgoing` to use.

    Returns:
    :   A non-null byte array containing the encoded bytes.

    Throws:
    :   `SaslException` - if `outgoing` cannot be successfully
        wrapped.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the authentication exchange has
        not completed, or if the negotiated quality of protection has
        neither integrity nor privacy.
  + ### getNegotiatedProperty

    [Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") getNegotiatedProperty([String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") propName)

    Retrieves the negotiated property.
    This method can be called only after the authentication exchange has
    completed (i.e., when `isComplete()` returns true); otherwise, an
    `IllegalStateException` is thrown.

    The [`Sasl`](Sasl.md "class in javax.security.sasl") class includes several well-known property names
    (For example, [`Sasl.QOP`](Sasl.md#QOP)). A SASL provider can support other
    properties which are specific to the vendor and/or a mechanism.

    Parameters:
    :   `propName` - the property

    Returns:
    :   The value of the negotiated property. If null, the property was
        not negotiated or is not applicable to this mechanism.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if this authentication exchange has not completed
  + ### dispose

    void dispose()
    throws [SaslException](SaslException.md "class in javax.security.sasl")

    Disposes of any system resources or security-sensitive information
    the SaslServer might be using. Invoking this method invalidates
    the SaslServer instance. This method is idempotent.

    Throws:
    :   `SaslException` - If a problem was encountered while disposing
        the resources.
