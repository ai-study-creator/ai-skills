# Interface HttpResponse.PushPromiseHandler<T>

Type Parameters:
:   `T` - the push promise response body type

Enclosing interface:
:   `HttpResponse<T>`

---

public static interface HttpResponse.PushPromiseHandler<T>

A handler for push promises.

A *push promise* is a synthetic request sent by an HTTP/2 server
when retrieving an initiating client-sent request. The server has
determined, possibly through inspection of the initiating request, that
the client will likely need the promised resource, and hence pushes a
synthetic push request, in the form of a push promise, to the client. The
client can choose to accept or reject the push promise request.

A push promise request may be received up to the point where the
response body of the initiating client-sent request has been fully
received. The delivery of a push promise response, however, is not
coordinated with the delivery of the response to the initiating
client-sent request.

  + ### applyPushPromise

    void applyPushPromise([HttpRequest](HttpRequest.md "class in java.net.http") initiatingRequest,
    [HttpRequest](HttpRequest.md "class in java.net.http") pushPromiseRequest,
    [Function](../../../../java.base/java/util/function/Function.md "interface in java.util.function")<[HttpResponse.BodyHandler](HttpResponse.BodyHandler.md "interface in java.net.http")<[T](HttpResponse.PushPromiseHandler.md "type parameter in HttpResponse.PushPromiseHandler")>,[CompletableFuture](../../../../java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.md "class in java.util.concurrent")<[HttpResponse](HttpResponse.md "interface in java.net.http")<[T](HttpResponse.PushPromiseHandler.md "type parameter in HttpResponse.PushPromiseHandler")>>> acceptor)

    Notification of an incoming push promise.

    This method is invoked once for each push promise received, up
    to the point where the response body of the initiating client-sent
    request has been fully received.

    A push promise is accepted by invoking the given `acceptor`
    function. The `acceptor` function must be passed a non-null
    `BodyHandler`, that is to be used to handle the promise's
    response body. The acceptor function will return a `CompletableFuture` that completes with the promise's response.

    If the `acceptor` function is not successfully invoked,
    then the push promise is rejected. The `acceptor` function will
    throw an `IllegalStateException` if invoked more than once.

    Parameters:
    :   `initiatingRequest` - the initiating client-send request
    :   `pushPromiseRequest` - the synthetic push request
    :   `acceptor` - the acceptor function that must be successfully
        invoked to accept the push promise

    Returns a push promise handler that accumulates push promises, and
    their responses, into the given map.

    Entries are added to the given map for each push promise accepted.
    The entry's key is the push request, and the entry's value is a
    `CompletableFuture` that completes with the response
    corresponding to the key's push request. A push request is rejected /
    cancelled if there is already an entry in the map whose key is
    [equal](HttpRequest.md#equals(java.lang.Object)) to it. A push request is
    rejected / cancelled if it does not have the same origin as its
    initiating request.

    Entries are added to the given map as soon as practically
    possible when a push promise is received and accepted. That way code,
    using such a map like a cache, can determine if a push promise has
    been issued by the server and avoid making, possibly, unnecessary
    requests.

    The delivery of a push promise response is not coordinated with
    the delivery of the response to the initiating client-sent request.
    However, when the response body for the initiating client-sent
    request has been fully received, the map is guaranteed to be fully
    populated, that is, no more entries will be added. The individual
    `CompletableFutures` contained in the map may or may not
    already be completed at this point.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the push promise response body type

    Parameters:
    :   `pushPromiseHandler` - t he body handler to use for push promises
    :   `pushPromisesMap` - a map to accumulate push promises into

    Returns:
    :   a push promise handler
