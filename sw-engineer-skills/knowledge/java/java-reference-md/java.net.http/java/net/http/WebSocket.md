# Interface WebSocket

---

public interface WebSocket

A WebSocket Client.

`WebSocket` instances are created through [`WebSocket.Builder`](WebSocket.Builder.md "interface in java.net.http").

WebSocket has an input and an output side. These sides are independent
from each other. A side can either be open or closed. Once closed, the side
remains closed. WebSocket messages are sent through a `WebSocket` and
received through a `WebSocket.Listener` associated with it. Messages
can be sent until the WebSocket's output is closed, and received until the
WebSocket's input is closed.

A send method is any of the `sendText`, `sendBinary`,
`sendPing`, `sendPong` and `sendClose` methods of
`WebSocket`. A send method initiates a send operation and returns a
`CompletableFuture` which completes once the operation has completed.
If the `CompletableFuture` completes normally the operation is
considered succeeded. If the `CompletableFuture` completes
exceptionally, the operation is considered failed. An operation that has been
initiated but not yet completed is considered pending.

A receive method is any of the `onText`, `onBinary`,
`onPing`, `onPong` and `onClose` methods of
`Listener`. WebSocket initiates a receive operation by invoking a
receive method on the listener. The listener then must return a
`CompletionStage` which completes once the operation has completed.

To control receiving of messages, a WebSocket maintains an
internal counter. This counter's value is a number of
times the WebSocket has yet to invoke a receive method. While this counter is
zero the WebSocket does not invoke receive methods. The counter is
incremented by `n` when `request(n)` is called. The counter is
decremented by one when the WebSocket invokes a receive method.
`onOpen` and `onError` are not receive methods. WebSocket invokes
`onOpen` prior to any other methods on the listener. WebSocket invokes
`onOpen` at most once. WebSocket may invoke `onError` at any
given time. If the WebSocket invokes `onError` or `onClose`, then
no further listener's methods will be invoked, no matter the value of the
counter. For a newly built WebSocket the counter is zero.

Unless otherwise stated, `null` arguments will cause methods
of `WebSocket` to throw `NullPointerException`, similarly,
`WebSocket` will not pass `null` arguments to methods of
`Listener`. The state of a WebSocket is not changed by the invocations
that throw or return a `CompletableFuture` that completes with one of
the `NullPointerException`, `IllegalArgumentException`,
`IllegalStateException` exceptions.

`WebSocket` handles received Ping and Close messages automatically
(as per the WebSocket Protocol) by replying with Pong and Close messages. If
the listener receives Ping or Close messages, no mandatory actions from the
listener are required.

* ## Method Details

  + ### sendText

    [CompletableFuture](../../../../java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.md "class in java.util.concurrent")<[WebSocket](WebSocket.md "interface in java.net.http")> sendText([CharSequence](../../../../java.base/java/lang/CharSequence.md "interface in java.lang") data,
    boolean last)

    Sends textual data with characters from the given character sequence.

    The character sequence must not be modified until the
    `CompletableFuture` returned from this method has completed.

    A `CompletableFuture` returned from this method can
    complete exceptionally with:
    - [`IllegalStateException`](../../../../java.base/java/lang/IllegalStateException.md "class in java.lang") -
      if there is a pending text or binary send operation
      or if the previous binary data does not complete the message- [`IOException`](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io") -
        if an I/O error occurs, or if the output is closed

    Parameters:
    :   `data` - the data
    :   `last` - `true` if this invocation completes the message,
        `false` otherwise

    Returns:
    :   a `CompletableFuture` that completes, with this WebSocket,
        when the data has been sent
  + ### sendBinary

    [CompletableFuture](../../../../java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.md "class in java.util.concurrent")<[WebSocket](WebSocket.md "interface in java.net.http")> sendBinary([ByteBuffer](../../../../java.base/java/nio/ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") data,
    boolean last)

    Sends binary data with bytes from the given buffer.

    The data is located in bytes from the buffer's position to its limit.
    Upon normal completion of a `CompletableFuture` returned from this
    method the buffer will have no remaining bytes. The buffer must not be
    accessed until after that.

    The `CompletableFuture` returned from this method can
    complete exceptionally with:
    - [`IllegalStateException`](../../../../java.base/java/lang/IllegalStateException.md "class in java.lang") -
      if there is a pending text or binary send operation
      or if the previous textual data does not complete the message- [`IOException`](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io") -
        if an I/O error occurs, or if the output is closed

    Parameters:
    :   `data` - the data
    :   `last` - `true` if this invocation completes the message,
        `false` otherwise

    Returns:
    :   a `CompletableFuture` that completes, with this WebSocket,
        when the data has been sent
  + ### sendPing

    [CompletableFuture](../../../../java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.md "class in java.util.concurrent")<[WebSocket](WebSocket.md "interface in java.net.http")> sendPing([ByteBuffer](../../../../java.base/java/nio/ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") message)

    Sends a Ping message with bytes from the given buffer.

    The message consists of not more than `125` bytes from the
    buffer's position to its limit. Upon normal completion of a
    `CompletableFuture` returned from this method the buffer will
    have no remaining bytes. The buffer must not be accessed until after that.

    The `CompletableFuture` returned from this method can
    complete exceptionally with:
    - [`IllegalStateException`](../../../../java.base/java/lang/IllegalStateException.md "class in java.lang") -
      if there is a pending ping or pong send operation- [`IllegalArgumentException`](../../../../java.base/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.md "class in java.lang") -
        if the message is too long- [`IOException`](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io") -
          if an I/O error occurs, or if the output is closed

    Parameters:
    :   `message` - the message

    Returns:
    :   a `CompletableFuture` that completes, with this WebSocket,
        when the Ping message has been sent
  + ### sendPong

    [CompletableFuture](../../../../java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.md "class in java.util.concurrent")<[WebSocket](WebSocket.md "interface in java.net.http")> sendPong([ByteBuffer](../../../../java.base/java/nio/ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") message)

    Sends a Pong message with bytes from the given buffer.

    The message consists of not more than `125` bytes from the
    buffer's position to its limit. Upon normal completion of a
    `CompletableFuture` returned from this method the buffer will have
    no remaining bytes. The buffer must not be accessed until after that.

    Given that the WebSocket implementation will automatically send a
    reciprocal pong when a ping is received, it is rarely required to send a
    pong message explicitly.

    The `CompletableFuture` returned from this method can
    complete exceptionally with:
    - [`IllegalStateException`](../../../../java.base/java/lang/IllegalStateException.md "class in java.lang") -
      if there is a pending ping or pong send operation- [`IllegalArgumentException`](../../../../java.base/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.md "class in java.lang") -
        if the message is too long- [`IOException`](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io") -
          if an I/O error occurs, or if the output is closed

    Parameters:
    :   `message` - the message

    Returns:
    :   a `CompletableFuture` that completes, with this WebSocket,
        when the Pong message has been sent
  + ### sendClose

    [CompletableFuture](../../../../java.base/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.md "class in java.util.concurrent")<[WebSocket](WebSocket.md "interface in java.net.http")> sendClose(int statusCode,
    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") reason)

    Initiates an orderly closure of this WebSocket's output by
    sending a Close message with the given status code and the reason.

    The `statusCode` is an integer from the range
    `1000 <= code <= 4999`. Status codes `1002`, `1003`,
    `1006`, `1007`, `1009`, `1010`, `1012`,
    `1013` and `1015` are illegal. Behaviour in respect to other
    status codes is implementation-specific. A legal `reason` is a
    string that has a UTF-8 representation not longer than `123` bytes.

    A `CompletableFuture` returned from this method can
    complete exceptionally with:
    - [`IllegalArgumentException`](../../../../java.base/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.md "class in java.lang") -
      if `statusCode` is illegal, or
      if `reason` is illegal- [`IOException`](../../../../java.base/java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io") -
        if an I/O error occurs, or if the output is closed

    Unless the `CompletableFuture` returned from this method
    completes with `IllegalArgumentException`, or the method throws
    `NullPointerException`, the output will be closed.

    If not already closed, the input remains open until a Close message
    [received](WebSocket.Listener.md#onClose(java.net.http.WebSocket,int,java.lang.String)), or
    `abort` is invoked, or an
    [error](WebSocket.Listener.md#onError(java.net.http.WebSocket,java.lang.Throwable)) occurs.

    Parameters:
    :   `statusCode` - the status code
    :   `reason` - the reason

    Returns:
    :   a `CompletableFuture` that completes, with this WebSocket,
        when the Close message has been sent
  + ### request

    void request(long n)

    Increments the counter of invocations of receive methods.

    This WebSocket will invoke `onText`, `onBinary`,
    `onPing`, `onPong` or `onClose` methods on the
    associated listener (i.e. receive methods) up to `n` more times.

    Parameters:
    :   `n` - the number of invocations

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `n <= 0`
  + ### getSubprotocol

    [String](../../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getSubprotocol()

    Returns the subprotocol used by this WebSocket.

    Returns:
    :   the subprotocol, or an empty string if there's no subprotocol
  + ### isOutputClosed

    boolean isOutputClosed()

    Tells whether this WebSocket's output is closed.

    If this method returns `true`, subsequent invocations will also
    return `true`.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if closed, `false` otherwise
  + ### isInputClosed

    boolean isInputClosed()

    Tells whether this WebSocket's input is closed.

    If this method returns `true`, subsequent invocations will also
    return `true`.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if closed, `false` otherwise
  + ### abort

    void abort()

    Closes this WebSocket's input and output abruptly.

    When this method returns both the input and the output will have been
    closed. Any pending send operations will fail with `IOException`.
    Subsequent invocations of `abort` will have no effect.
