# Class Subject

javax.security.auth.Subject

All Implemented Interfaces:
:   `Serializable`

---

public final class Subject
extends [Object](../../../java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Serializable](../../../java/io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io")

A `Subject` represents a grouping of related information
for a single entity, such as a person.
Such information includes the Subject's identities as well as
its security-related attributes
(passwords and cryptographic keys, for example).

Subjects may potentially have multiple identities.
Each identity is represented as a `Principal`
within the `Subject`. Principals simply bind names to a
`Subject`. For example, a `Subject` that happens
to be a person, Alice, might have two Principals:
one which binds "Alice Bar", the name on her driver license,
to the `Subject`, and another which binds,
"999-99-9999", the number on her student identification card,
to the `Subject`. Both Principals refer to the same
`Subject` even though each has a different name.

A `Subject` may also own security-related attributes,
which are referred to as credentials.
Sensitive credentials that require special protection, such as
private cryptographic keys, are stored within a private credential
`Set`. Credentials intended to be shared, such as
public key certificates or Kerberos server tickets are stored
within a public credential `Set`. Different permissions
are required to access and modify the different credential Sets.

To retrieve all the Principals associated with a `Subject`,
invoke the `getPrincipals` method. To retrieve
all the public or private credentials belonging to a `Subject`,
invoke the `getPublicCredentials` method or
`getPrivateCredentials` method, respectively.
To modify the returned `Set` of Principals and credentials,
use the methods defined in the `Set` class.
For example:

```
      Subject subject;
      Principal principal;
      Object credential;

      // add a Principal and credential to the Subject
      subject.getPrincipals().add(principal);
      subject.getPublicCredentials().add(credential);
```

This `Subject` class implements `Serializable`.
While the Principals associated with the `Subject` are serialized,
the credentials associated with the `Subject` are not.
Note that the `java.security.Principal` class
does not implement `Serializable`. Therefore, all concrete
`Principal` implementations associated with Subjects
must implement `Serializable`.

* ## Constructor Details

  + ### Subject

    public Subject()

    Create an instance of a `Subject`
    with an empty `Set` of Principals and empty
    Sets of public and private credentials.

    The newly constructed Sets check whether this `Subject`
    has been set read-only before permitting subsequent modifications.
    The newly created Sets also prevent illegal modifications
    by ensuring that callers have sufficient permissions. These Sets
    also prohibit null elements, and attempts to add, query, or remove
    a null element will result in a `NullPointerException`.

    To modify the Principals Set, the caller must have
    `AuthPermission("modifyPrincipals")`.
    To modify the public credential Set, the caller must have
    `AuthPermission("modifyPublicCredentials")`.
    To modify the private credential Set, the caller must have
    `AuthPermission("modifyPrivateCredentials")`.
  + ### Subject

    public Subject(boolean readOnly,
    [Set](../../../java/util/Set.md "interface in java.util")<? extends [Principal](../../../java/security/Principal.md "interface in java.security")> principals,
    [Set](../../../java/util/Set.md "interface in java.util")<?> pubCredentials,
    [Set](../../../java/util/Set.md "interface in java.util")<?> privCredentials)

    Create an instance of a `Subject` with
    Principals and credentials.

    The Principals and credentials from the specified Sets
    are copied into newly constructed Sets.
    These newly created Sets check whether this `Subject`
    has been set read-only before permitting subsequent modifications.
    The newly created Sets also prevent illegal modifications
    by ensuring that callers have sufficient permissions. These Sets
    also prohibit null elements, and attempts to add, query, or remove
    a null element will result in a `NullPointerException`.

    To modify the Principals Set, the caller must have
    `AuthPermission("modifyPrincipals")`.
    To modify the public credential Set, the caller must have
    `AuthPermission("modifyPublicCredentials")`.
    To modify the private credential Set, the caller must have
    `AuthPermission("modifyPrivateCredentials")`.

    Parameters:
    :   `readOnly` - true if the `Subject` is to be read-only,
        and false otherwise.
    :   `principals` - the `Set` of Principals
        to be associated with this `Subject`.
    :   `pubCredentials` - the `Set` of public credentials
        to be associated with this `Subject`.
    :   `privCredentials` - the `Set` of private credentials
        to be associated with this `Subject`.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified
        `principals`, `pubCredentials`,
        or `privCredentials` are `null`,
        or a null value exists within any of these three
        Sets.
* ## Method Details

  + ### setReadOnly

    public void setReadOnly()

    Set this `Subject` to be read-only.

    Modifications (additions and removals) to this Subject's
    `Principal` `Set` and
    credential Sets will be disallowed.
    The `destroy` operation on this Subject's credentials will
    still be permitted.

    Subsequent attempts to modify the Subject's `Principal`
    and credential Sets will result in an
    `IllegalStateException` being thrown.
    Also, once a `Subject` is read-only,
    it can not be reset to being writable again.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager is installed and the
        caller does not have an
        [`AuthPermission("setReadOnly")`](AuthPermission.md#%3Cinit%3E(java.lang.String)) permission to set this
        `Subject` to be read-only.
  + ### isReadOnly

    public boolean isReadOnly()

    Query whether this `Subject` is read-only.

    Returns:
    :   true if this `Subject` is read-only, false otherwise.
  + ### getSubject

    public static [Subject](Subject.md "class in javax.security.auth") getSubject([AccessControlContext](../../../java/security/AccessControlContext.md "class in java.security") acc)

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    This method depends on [`AccessControlContext`](../../../java/security/AccessControlContext.md "class in java.security")
    which, in conjunction with
    [the Security Manager](../../../java/lang/SecurityManager.md "class in java.lang"), is deprecated
    and subject to removal in a future release. However,
    obtaining a Subject is useful independent of the Security Manager.
    Thus, a replacement API named [`current()`](#current()) has been added
    which can be used to obtain the current subject.

    Get the `Subject` associated with the provided
    `AccessControlContext`.

    The `AccessControlContext` may contain many
    Subjects (from nested `doAs` calls).
    In this situation, the most recent `Subject` associated
    with the `AccessControlContext` is returned.

    Parameters:
    :   `acc` - the `AccessControlContext` from which to retrieve
        the `Subject`.

    Returns:
    :   the `Subject` associated with the provided
        `AccessControlContext`, or `null`
        if no `Subject` is associated
        with the provided `AccessControlContext`.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager is installed and the
        caller does not have an
        [`AuthPermission("getSubject")`](AuthPermission.md#%3Cinit%3E(java.lang.String)) permission to get the
        `Subject`.
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the provided
        `AccessControlContext` is `null`.
  + ### current

    public static [Subject](Subject.md "class in javax.security.auth") current()

    Returns the current subject.

    The current subject is installed by the [`callAs(javax.security.auth.Subject, java.util.concurrent.Callable<T>)`](#callAs(javax.security.auth.Subject,java.util.concurrent.Callable)) method.
    When `callAs(subject, action)` is called, `action` is
    executed with `subject` as its current subject which can be
    retrieved by this method. After `action` is finished, the current
    subject is reset to its previous value. The current
    subject is `null` before the first call of `callAs()`.

    Returns:
    :   the current subject, or `null` if a current subject is
        not installed or the current subject is set to `null`.

    throws [CompletionException](../../../java/util/concurrent/CompletionException.md "class in java.util.concurrent")

    Executes a `Callable` with `subject` as the
    current subject.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of value returned by the `call` method
        of `action`

    Parameters:
    :   `subject` - the `Subject` that the specified `action`
        will run as. This parameter may be `null`.
    :   `action` - the code to be run with `subject` as its current
        subject. Must not be `null`.

    Returns:
    :   the value returned by the `call` method of `action`

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `action` is `null`
    :   `CompletionException` - if `action.call()` throws an exception.
        The cause of the `CompletionException` is set to the exception
        thrown by `action.call()`.

    Thus, a replacement API named [`callAs(javax.security.auth.Subject, java.util.concurrent.Callable<T>)`](#callAs(javax.security.auth.Subject,java.util.concurrent.Callable)) has been added
    which can be used to perform the same work.

    Perform work as a particular `Subject`.

    This method first retrieves the current Thread's
    `AccessControlContext` via
    `AccessController.getContext`,
    and then instantiates a new `AccessControlContext`
    using the retrieved context along with a new
    `SubjectDomainCombiner` (constructed using
    the provided `Subject`).
    Finally, this method invokes `AccessController.doPrivileged`,
    passing it the provided `PrivilegedAction`,
    as well as the newly constructed `AccessControlContext`.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the value returned by the PrivilegedAction's
        `run` method.

    Parameters:
    :   `subject` - the `Subject` that the specified
        `action` will run as. This parameter

    public <T extends [Principal](../../../java/security/Principal.md "interface in java.security")> [Set](../../../java/util/Set.md "interface in java.util")<T> getPrincipals([Class](../../../java/lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> c)

    Return a `Set` of Principals associated with this
    `Subject` that are instances or subclasses of the specified
    `Class`.

    The returned `Set` is not backed by this Subject's
    internal `Principal` `Set`. A new
    `Set` is created and returned for each method invocation.
    Modifications to the returned `Set`
    will not affect the internal `Principal` `Set`.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the class modeled by `c`

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - the returned `Set` of Principals will all be
        instances of this class.

    Returns:
    :   a `Set` of Principals that are instances of the
        specified `Class`.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified `Class`
        is `null`.
  + ### getPublicCredentials

    public [Set](../../../java/util/Set.md "interface in java.util")<[Object](../../../java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")> getPublicCredentials()

    Return the `Set` of public credentials held by this
    `Subject`.

    The returned `Set` is backed by this Subject's
    internal public Credential `Set`. Any modification
    to the returned `Set` affects the internal public
    Credential `Set` as well.

    If a security manager is installed, the caller must have a
    [`AuthPermission("modifyPublicCredentials")`](AuthPermission.md#%3Cinit%3E(java.lang.String)) permission to modify
    the returned set, or a `SecurityException` will be thrown.

    Returns:
    :   a `Set` of public credentials held by this
        `Subject`.
  + ### getPrivateCredentials

    public [Set](../../../java/util/Set.md "interface in java.util")<[Object](../../../java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")> getPrivateCredentials()

    Return the `Set` of private credentials held by this
    `Subject`.

    The returned `Set` is backed by this Subject's
    internal private Credential `Set`. Any modification
    to the returned `Set` affects the internal private
    Credential `Set` as well.

    If a security manager is installed, the caller must have a
    [`AuthPermission("modifyPrivateCredentials")`](AuthPermission.md#%3Cinit%3E(java.lang.String)) permission to modify
    the returned set, or a `SecurityException` will be thrown.

    While iterating through the `Set`,
    a `SecurityException` is thrown if a security manager is installed
    and the caller does not have a [`PrivateCredentialPermission`](PrivateCredentialPermission.md "class in javax.security.auth")
    to access a particular Credential. The `Iterator`
    is nevertheless advanced to the next element in the `Set`.

    Returns:
    :   a `Set` of private credentials held by this
        `Subject`.
  + ### getPublicCredentials

    public <T> [Set](../../../java/util/Set.md "interface in java.util")<T> getPublicCredentials([Class](../../../java/lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> c)

    Return a `Set` of public credentials associated with this
    `Subject` that are instances or subclasses of the specified
    `Class`.

    The returned `Set` is not backed by this Subject's
    internal public Credential `Set`. A new
    `Set` is created and returned for each method invocation.
    Modifications to the returned `Set`
    will not affect the internal public Credential `Set`.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the class modeled by `c`

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - the returned `Set` of public credentials will all be
        instances of this class.

    Returns:
    :   a `Set` of public credentials that are instances
        of the specified `Class`.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified `Class`
        is `null`.
  + ### getPrivateCredentials

    public <T> [Set](../../../java/util/Set.md "interface in java.util")<T> getPrivateCredentials([Class](../../../java/lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> c)

    Return a `Set` of private credentials associated with this
    `Subject` that are instances or subclasses of the specified
    `Class`.

    If a security manager is installed, the caller must have a
    [`PrivateCredentialPermission`](PrivateCredentialPermission.md "class in javax.security.auth") to access all of the requested
    Credentials, or a `SecurityException` will be thrown.

    The returned `Set` is not backed by this Subject's
    internal private Credential `Set`. A new
    `Set` is created and returned for each method invocation.
    Modifications to the returned `Set`
    will not affect the internal private Credential `Set`.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the class modeled by `c`

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - the returned `Set` of private credentials will all be
        instances of this class.

    Returns:
    :   a `Set` of private credentials that are instances
        of the specified `Class`.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified `Class`
        is `null`.
  + ### equals

    public boolean equals([Object](../../../java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") o)

    Compares the specified Object with this `Subject`
    for equality. Returns true if the given object is also a Subject
    and the two `Subject` instances are equivalent.
    More formally, two `Subject` instances are
    equal if their `Principal` and `Credential`
    Sets are equal.

    Overrides:
    :   `equals` in class `Object`

    Parameters:
    :   `o` - Object to be compared for equality with this
        `Subject`.

    Returns:
    :   true if the specified Object is equal to this
        `Subject`.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager is installed and the
        caller does not have a [`PrivateCredentialPermission`](PrivateCredentialPermission.md "class in javax.security.auth")
        permission to access the private credentials for this
        `Subject` or the provided `Subject`.

    Returns:
    :   a hashcode for this `Subject`.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager is installed and the
        caller does not have a [`PrivateCredentialPermission`](PrivateCredentialPermission.md "class in javax.security.auth")
        permission to access this Subject's private credentials.
