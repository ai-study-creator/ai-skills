public abstract class KeyAgreementSpi
extends [Object](../../java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

This class defines the *Service Provider Interface* (**SPI**)
for the `KeyAgreement` class.
All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation
of a particular key agreement algorithm.

The keys involved in establishing a shared secret are created by one
of the
key generators (`KeyPairGenerator` or
`KeyGenerator`), a `KeyFactory`, or as a result from
an intermediate phase of the key agreement protocol
([`engineDoPhase`](#engineDoPhase(java.security.Key,boolean))).

For each of the correspondents in the key exchange,
`engineDoPhase`
needs to be called. For example, if the key exchange is with one other
party, `engineDoPhase` needs to be called once, with the
`lastPhase` flag set to `true`.
If the key exchange is
with two other parties, `engineDoPhase` needs to be called twice,
the first time setting the `lastPhase` flag to
`false`, and the second time setting it to `true`.
There may be any number of parties involved in a key exchange.

  + ### engineInit

    protected abstract void engineInit([Key](../../java/security/Key.md "interface in java.security") key,
    [SecureRandom](../../java/security/SecureRandom.md "class in java.security") random)
    throws [InvalidKeyException](../../java/security/InvalidKeyException.md "class in java.security")

    Initializes this key agreement with the given key and source of
    randomness. The given key is required to contain all the algorithm
    parameters required for this key agreement.

    If the key agreement algorithm requires random bytes, it gets them
    from the given source of randomness, `random`.
    However, if the underlying
    algorithm implementation does not require any random bytes,
    `random` is ignored.

    Parameters:
    :   `key` - the party's private information. For example, in the case
        of the Diffie-Hellman key agreement, this would be the party's own
        Diffie-Hellman private key.
    :   `random` - the source of randomness

    Throws:
    :   `InvalidKeyException` - if the given key is
        inappropriate for this key agreement, e.g., is of the wrong type or
        has an incompatible algorithm type.
  + ### engineInit

    protected abstract void engineInit([Key](../../java/security/Key.md "interface in java.security") key,
    [AlgorithmParameterSpec](../../java/security/spec/AlgorithmParameterSpec.md "interface in java.security.spec") params,
    [SecureRandom](../../java/security/SecureRandom.md "class in java.security") random)
    throws [InvalidKeyException](../../java/security/InvalidKeyException.md "class in java.security"),
    [InvalidAlgorithmParameterException](../../java/security/InvalidAlgorithmParameterException.md "class in java.security")

    Initializes this key agreement with the given key, set of
    algorithm parameters, and source of randomness.

    Parameters:
    :   `key` - the party's private information. For example, in the case
        of the Diffie-Hellman key agreement, this would be the party's own
        Diffie-Hellman private key.
    :   `params` - the key agreement parameters
    :   `random` - the source of randomness

    Throws:
    :   `InvalidKeyException` - if the given key is
        inappropriate for this key agreement, e.g., is of the wrong type or
        has an incompatible algorithm type.
    :   `InvalidAlgorithmParameterException` - if the given parameters
        are inappropriate for this key agreement.
  + ### engineDoPhase

    protected abstract [Key](../../java/security/Key.md "interface in java.security") engineDoPhase([Key](../../java/security/Key.md "interface in java.security") key,
    boolean lastPhase)
    throws [InvalidKeyException](../../java/security/InvalidKeyException.md "class in java.security"),
    [IllegalStateException](../../java/lang/IllegalStateException.md "class in java.lang")

    Executes the next phase of this key agreement with the given
    key that was received from one of the other parties involved in this key
    agreement.

    Parameters:
    :   `key` - the key for this phase. For example, in the case of
        Diffie-Hellman between 2 parties, this would be the other party's
        Diffie-Hellman public key.
    :   `lastPhase` - flag which indicates whether this is the last
        phase of this key agreement.

    Returns:
    :   the (intermediate) key resulting from this phase,
        or `null` if this phase does not yield a key

    Throws:
    :   `InvalidKeyException` - if the given key is inappropriate for
        this phase.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if this key agreement has not been
        initialized.
  + ### engineGenerateSecret

    protected abstract byte[] engineGenerateSecret()
    throws [IllegalStateException](../../java/lang/IllegalStateException.md "class in java.lang")

    Generates the shared secret and returns it in a new buffer.

    This method resets this `KeyAgreementSpi` object to the state
    that it was in after the most recent call to one of the `init`
    methods. After a call to `generateSecret`, the object can be reused
    for further key agreement operations by calling `doPhase` to supply
    new keys, and then calling `generateSecret` to produce a new
    secret. In this case, the private information and algorithm parameters
    supplied to `init` will be used for multiple key agreement
    operations. The `init` method can be called after
    `generateSecret` to change the private information used in
    subsequent operations.

    Returns:
    :   the new buffer with the shared secret

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if this key agreement has not been
        initialized or if `doPhase` has not been called to supply the
        keys for all parties in the agreement
  + ### engineGenerateSecret

    protected abstract int engineGenerateSecret(byte[] sharedSecret,
    int offset)
    throws [IllegalStateException](../../java/lang/IllegalStateException.md "class in java.lang"),
    [ShortBufferException](ShortBufferException.md "class in javax.crypto")

    Generates the shared secret, and places it into the buffer
    `sharedSecret`, beginning at `offset` inclusive.

    If the `sharedSecret` buffer is too small to hold the
    result, a `ShortBufferException` is thrown.
    In this case, this call should be repeated with a larger output buffer.

    This method resets this `KeyAgreementSpi` object to the state
    that it was in after the most recent call to one of the `init`
    methods. After a call to `generateSecret`, the object can be reused
    for further key agreement operations by calling `doPhase` to supply
    new keys, and then calling `generateSecret` to produce a new
    secret. In this case, the private information and algorithm parameters
    supplied to `init` will be used for multiple key agreement
    operations. The `init` method can be called after
    `generateSecret` to change the private information used in
    subsequent operations.

    Parameters:
    :   `sharedSecret` - the buffer for the shared secret
    :   `offset` - the offset in `sharedSecret` where the
        shared secret will be stored

    Returns:
    :   the number of bytes placed into `sharedSecret`

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if this key agreement has not been
        initialized or if `doPhase` has not been called to supply the
        keys for all parties in the agreement
    :   `ShortBufferException` - if the given output buffer is too small
        to hold the secret
  + ### engineGenerateSecret

    protected abstract [SecretKey](SecretKey.md "interface in javax.crypto") engineGenerateSecret([String](../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") algorithm)
    throws [IllegalStateException](../../java/lang/IllegalStateException.md "class in java.lang"),
    [NoSuchAlgorithmException](../../java/security/NoSuchAlgorithmException.md "class in java.security"),
    [InvalidKeyException](../../java/security/InvalidKeyException.md "class in java.security")

    Creates the shared secret and returns it as a secret key object
    of the requested algorithm type.

    This method resets this `KeyAgreementSpi` object to the state
    that it was in after the most recent call to one of the `init`
    methods. After a call to `generateSecret`, the object can be reused
    for further key agreement operations by calling `doPhase` to supply
    new keys, and then calling `generateSecret` to produce a new
    secret. In this case, the private information and algorithm parameters
    supplied to `init` will be used for multiple key agreement
    operations. The `init` method can be called after
    `generateSecret` to change the private information used in
    subsequent operations.

    Parameters:
    :   `algorithm` - the requested secret key algorithm

    Returns:
    :   the shared secret key

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if this key agreement has not been
        initialized or if `doPhase` has not been called to supply the
        keys for all parties in the agreement
    :   `NoSuchAlgorithmException` - if the requested secret key
        algorithm is not available
    :   `InvalidKeyException` - if the shared secret key material cannot
        be used to generate a secret key of the requested algorithm type (e.g.,
        the key material is too short)
