public abstract class SSLEngine
extends [Object](../../../java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

A class which enables secure communications using protocols such as
the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or
 [IETF RFC 2246 "Transport
Layer Security" (TLS)](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt)  protocols, but is transport independent.

The secure communications modes include:

* *Integrity Protection*. SSL/TLS/DTLS protects against
  modification of messages by an active wiretapper.* *Authentication*. In most modes, SSL/TLS/DTLS provides
    peer authentication. Servers are usually authenticated, and
    clients may be authenticated as requested by servers.* *Confidentiality (Privacy Protection)*. In most
      modes, SSL/TLS/DTLS encrypts data being sent between client and
      server. This protects the confidentiality of data, so that
      passive wiretappers won't see sensitive data such as financial
      information or personal information of many kinds.

These kinds of protection are specified by a "cipher suite", which
is a combination of cryptographic algorithms used by a given SSL
connection. During the negotiation process, the two endpoints must
agree on a cipher suite that is available in both environments. If
there is no such suite in common, no SSL connection can be
established, and no data can be exchanged.

The cipher suite used is established by a negotiation process called
"handshaking". The goal of this process is to create or rejoin a
"session", which may protect many connections over time. After
handshaking has completed, you can access session attributes by
using the [`getSession()`](#getSession()) method.

The `SSLSocket` class provides much of the same security
functionality, but all the inbound and outbound data is
automatically transported using the underlying [`Socket`](../../../java/net/Socket.md "class in java.net"), which by design uses a blocking model.
While this is appropriate for many applications, this model does not
provide the scalability required by large servers.

The primary distinction of an `SSLEngine` is that it
operates on inbound and outbound byte streams, independent of the
transport mechanism. It is the responsibility of the
`SSLEngine` user to arrange for reliable I/O transport to
the peer. By separating the SSL/TLS/DTLS abstraction from the I/O
transport mechanism, the `SSLEngine` can be used for a
wide variety of I/O types, such as [`non-blocking I/O (polling)`](../../../java/nio/channels/spi/AbstractSelectableChannel.md#configureBlocking(boolean)), [`selectable non-blocking I/O`](../../../java/nio/channels/Selector.md "class in java.nio.channels"), [`Socket`](../../../java/net/Socket.md "class in java.net") and the
traditional Input/OutputStreams, local [`ByteBuffers`](../../../java/nio/ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") or byte arrays,  [future asynchronous
I/O models](http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=203) , and so on.

At a high level, the `SSLEngine` appears thus:

```
                   app data

                |           ^
                |     |     |

           +----+-----|-----+----+
           |          |          |
           |       SSL|Engine    |
   wrap()  |          |          |  unwrap()

           |          |          |
           +----+-----|-----+----+
                |     |     ^
                |     |     |
                v           |

                   net data
```

Application data (also known as plaintext or cleartext) is data which
is produced or consumed by an application. Its counterpart is
network data, which consists of either handshaking and/or ciphertext
(encrypted) data, and destined to be transported via an I/O
mechanism. Inbound data is data which has been received from the
peer, and outbound data is destined for the peer.

(In the context of an `SSLEngine`, the term "handshake
data" is taken to mean any data exchanged to establish and control a
secure connection. Handshake data includes the SSL/TLS/DTLS messages
"alert", "change\_cipher\_spec," and "handshake.")

There are five distinct phases to an `SSLEngine`.

1. Creation - The `SSLEngine` has been created and
   initialized, but has not yet been used. During this phase, an
   application may set any `SSLEngine`-specific settings
   (enabled cipher suites, whether the `SSLEngine` should
   handshake in client or server mode, and so on). Once
   handshaking has begun, though, any new settings (except
   client/server mode, see below) will be used for
   the next handshake.- Initial Handshake - The initial handshake is a procedure by
     which the two peers exchange communication parameters until an
     SSLSession is established. Application data can not be sent during
     this phase.- Application Data - Once the communication parameters have
       been established and the handshake is complete, application data
       may flow through the `SSLEngine`. Outbound
       application messages are encrypted and integrity protected,
       and inbound messages reverse the process.- Rehandshaking - Either side may request a renegotiation of
         the session at any time during the Application Data phase. New
         handshaking data can be intermixed among the application data.
         Before starting the rehandshake phase, the application may
         reset the SSL/TLS/DTLS communication parameters such as the list of
         enabled ciphersuites and whether to use client authentication,
         but can not change between client/server modes. As before, once
         handshaking has begun, any new `SSLEngine`
         configuration settings will not be used until the next
         handshake.- Closure - When the connection is no longer needed, the client
           and the server applications should each close both sides of their
           respective connections. For `SSLEngine` objects, an
           application should call [`closeOutbound()`](#closeOutbound()) and
           send any remaining messages to the peer. Likewise, an application
           should receive any remaining messages from the peer before calling
           [`closeInbound()`](#closeInbound()). The underlying transport mechanism
           can then be closed after both sides of the `SSLEngine` have
           been closed. If the connection is not closed in an orderly manner
           (for example [`closeInbound()`](#closeInbound()) is called before the
           peer's write closure notification has been received), exceptions
           will be raised to indicate that an error has occurred. Once an
           engine is closed, it is not reusable: a new `SSLEngine`
           must be created.

An `SSLEngine` is created by calling [`SSLContext.createSSLEngine()`](SSLContext.md#createSSLEngine()) from an initialized
`SSLContext`. Any configuration
parameters should be set before making the first call to
`wrap()`, `unwrap()`, or
`beginHandshake()`. These methods all trigger the
initial handshake.

Data moves through the engine by calling [`wrap()`](#wrap(java.nio.ByteBuffer,java.nio.ByteBuffer)) or [`unwrap()`](#unwrap(java.nio.ByteBuffer,java.nio.ByteBuffer)) on outbound or inbound data, respectively. Depending on
the state of the `SSLEngine`, a `wrap()` call
may consume application data from the source buffer and may produce
network data in the destination buffer. The outbound data
may contain application and/or handshake data. A call to
`unwrap()` will examine the source buffer and may
advance the handshake if the data is handshaking information, or
may place application data in the destination buffer if the data
is application. The state of the underlying SSL/TLS/DTLS algorithm
will determine when data is consumed and produced.

Calls to `wrap()` and `unwrap()` return an
`SSLEngineResult` which indicates the status of the
operation, and (optionally) how to interact with the engine to make
progress.

The `SSLEngine` produces/consumes complete SSL/TLS/DTLS
packets only, and does not store application data internally between
calls to `wrap()/unwrap()`. Thus input and output
`ByteBuffer`s must be sized appropriately to hold the
maximum record that can be produced. Calls to [`SSLSession.getPacketBufferSize()`](SSLSession.md#getPacketBufferSize()) and [`SSLSession.getApplicationBufferSize()`](SSLSession.md#getApplicationBufferSize()) should be used to determine
the appropriate buffer sizes. The size of the outbound application
data buffer generally does not matter. If buffer conditions do not
allow for the proper consumption/production of data, the application
must determine (via [`SSLEngineResult`](SSLEngineResult.md "class in javax.net.ssl")) and correct the
problem, and then try the call again.

For example, `unwrap()` will return a [`SSLEngineResult.Status.BUFFER_OVERFLOW`](SSLEngineResult.Status.md#BUFFER_OVERFLOW) result if the engine
determines that there is not enough destination buffer space available.
Applications should call [`SSLSession.getApplicationBufferSize()`](SSLSession.md#getApplicationBufferSize())
and compare that value with the space available in the destination buffer,
enlarging the buffer if necessary. Similarly, if `unwrap()`
were to return a [`SSLEngineResult.Status.BUFFER_UNDERFLOW`](SSLEngineResult.Status.md#BUFFER_UNDERFLOW), the
application should call [`SSLSession.getPacketBufferSize()`](SSLSession.md#getPacketBufferSize()) to ensure
that the source buffer has enough room to hold a record (enlarging if
necessary), and then obtain more inbound data.

```
   SSLEngineResult r = engine.unwrap(src, dst);
   switch (r.getStatus()) {
   case BUFFER_OVERFLOW:
       // Could attempt to drain the dst buffer of any already obtained
       // data, but we'll just increase it to the size needed.
       int appSize = engine.getSession().getApplicationBufferSize();
       ByteBuffer b = ByteBuffer.allocate(appSize + dst.position());
       dst.flip();
       b.put(dst);
       dst = b;
       // retry the operation.
       break;
   case BUFFER_UNDERFLOW:
       int netSize = engine.getSession().getPacketBufferSize();
       // Resize buffer if needed.
       if (netSize > src.capacity()) {
           ByteBuffer b = ByteBuffer.allocate(netSize);
           src.flip();
           b.put(src);
           src = b;
       }
       // Obtain more inbound network data for src,
       // then retry the operation.
       break;
   // other cases: CLOSED, OK.
   }
```

Unlike `SSLSocket`, all methods of SSLEngine are
non-blocking. `SSLEngine` implementations may
require the results of tasks that may take an extended period of
time to complete, or may even block. For example, a TrustManager
may need to connect to a remote certificate validation service,
or a KeyManager might need to prompt a user to determine which
certificate to use as part of client authentication. Additionally,
creating cryptographic signatures and verifying them can be slow,
seemingly blocking.

For any operation which may potentially block, the
`SSLEngine` will create a [`Runnable`](../../../java/lang/Runnable.md "interface in java.lang")
delegated task. When `SSLEngineResult` indicates that a
delegated task result is needed, the application must call [`getDelegatedTask()`](#getDelegatedTask()) to obtain an outstanding delegated task and
call its [`run()`](../../../java/lang/Runnable.md#run()) method (possibly using
a different thread depending on the compute strategy). The
application should continue obtaining delegated tasks until no more
exist, and try the original operation again.

At the end of a communication session, applications should properly
close the SSL/TLS/DTLS link. The SSL/TLS/DTLS protocols have closure
handshake messages, and these messages should be communicated to the
peer before releasing the `SSLEngine` and closing the
underlying transport mechanism. A close can be initiated by one of:
an SSLException, an inbound closure handshake message, or one of the
close methods. In all cases, closure handshake messages are
generated by the engine, and `wrap()` should be repeatedly
called until the resulting `SSLEngineResult`'s status
returns "CLOSED", or [`isOutboundDone()`](#isOutboundDone()) returns true. All
data obtained from the `wrap()` method should be sent to the
peer.

[`closeOutbound()`](#closeOutbound()) is used to signal the engine that the
application will not be sending any more data.

A peer will signal its intent to close by sending its own closure
handshake message. After this message has been received and
processed by the local `SSLEngine`'s `unwrap()`
call, the application can detect the close by calling
`unwrap()` and looking for a `SSLEngineResult`
with status "CLOSED", or if [`isInboundDone()`](#isInboundDone()) returns true.
If for some reason the peer closes the communication link without
sending the proper SSL/TLS/DTLS closure message, the application can
detect the end-of-stream and can signal the engine via [`closeInbound()`](#closeInbound()) that there will no more inbound messages to
process. Some applications might choose to require orderly shutdown
messages from a peer, in which case they can check that the closure
was generated by a handshake message and not by an end-of-stream
condition.

There are two groups of cipher suites which you will need to know
about when managing cipher suites:

* *Supported* cipher suites: all the suites which are
  supported by the SSL implementation. This list is reported
  using [`getSupportedCipherSuites()`](#getSupportedCipherSuites()).* *Enabled* cipher suites, which may be fewer than
    the full set of supported suites. This group is set using the
    [`setEnabledCipherSuites(String[])`](#setEnabledCipherSuites(java.lang.String%5B%5D)) method, and
    queried using the [`getEnabledCipherSuites()`](#getEnabledCipherSuites()) method.
    Initially, a default set of cipher suites will be enabled on a
    new engine that represents the minimum suggested
    configuration.

Implementation defaults require that only cipher suites which
authenticate servers and provide confidentiality be enabled by
default. Only if both sides explicitly agree to unauthenticated
and/or non-private (unencrypted) communications will such a
cipher suite be selected.

Each SSL/TLS/DTLS connection must have one client and one server, thus
each endpoint must decide which role to assume. This choice determines
who begins the handshaking process as well as which type of messages
should be sent by each party. The method [`setUseClientMode(boolean)`](#setUseClientMode(boolean)) configures the mode. Note that the
default mode for a new `SSLEngine` is provider-specific.
Applications should set the mode explicitly before invoking other
methods of the `SSLEngine`. Once the initial handshaking has
started, an `SSLEngine` can not switch between client and server
modes, even when performing renegotiations.

The ApplicationProtocol `String` values returned by the methods
in this class are in the network byte representation sent by the peer.
The bytes could be directly compared, or converted to its Unicode
`String` format for comparison.
> ```
>      String networkString = sslEngine.getHandshakeApplicationProtocol();
>      byte[] bytes = networkString.getBytes(StandardCharsets.ISO_8859_1);
>
>      //
>      // Match using bytes:
>      //
>      //   "http/1.1"                       (7-bit ASCII values same in UTF-8)
>      //   MEETEI MAYEK LETTERS "HUK UN I"  (Unicode 0xabcd->0xabcf)
>      //
>      String HTTP1_1 = "http/1.1";
>      byte[] HTTP1_1_BYTES = HTTP1_1.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
>
>      byte[] HUK_UN_I_BYTES = new byte[] {
>          (byte) 0xab, (byte) 0xcd,
>          (byte) 0xab, (byte) 0xce,
>          (byte) 0xab, (byte) 0xcf};
>
>      if ((Arrays.compare(bytes, HTTP1_1_BYTES) == 0 )
>              || Arrays.compare(bytes, HUK_UN_I_BYTES) == 0) {
>         ...
>      }
>
>      //
>      // Alternatively match using string.equals() if we know the ALPN value
>      // was encoded from a String using a certain character set,
>      // for example UTF-8.  The ALPN value must first be properly
>      // decoded to a Unicode String before use.
>      //
>      String unicodeString = new String(bytes, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
>      if (unicodeString.equals(HTTP1_1)
>              || unicodeString.equals("\uabcd\uabce\uabcf")) {
>          ...
>      }
> ```

Applications might choose to process delegated tasks in different
threads. When an `SSLEngine`
is created, the current [`AccessControlContext`](../../../java/security/AccessControlContext.md "class in java.security")
is saved. All future delegated tasks will be processed using this
context: that is, all access control decisions will be made using the
context captured at engine creation.

---

**Concurrency Notes**:
There are two concurrency issues to be aware of:

1. The `wrap()` and `unwrap()` methods
   may execute concurrently of each other.- The SSL/TLS/DTLS protocols employ ordered packets.
     Applications must take care to ensure that generated packets
     are delivered in sequence. If packets arrive
     out-of-order, unexpected or fatal results may occur.

     For example:

     ```
                   synchronized (outboundLock) {
                       sslEngine.wrap(src, dst);
                       outboundQueue.put(dst);
                   }
     ```

     As a corollary, two threads must not attempt to call the same method
     (either `wrap()` or `unwrap()`) concurrently,
     because there is no way to guarantee the eventual packet ordering.

    throws [SSLException](SSLException.md "class in javax.net.ssl")

    Attempts to encode plaintext bytes from a subsequence of data
    buffers into SSL/TLS/DTLS network data. This *"gathering"*
    operation encodes, in a single invocation, a sequence of bytes
    from one or more of a given sequence of buffers. Gathering
    wraps are often useful when implementing network protocols or
    file formats that, for example, group data into segments
    consisting of one or more fixed-length headers followed by a
    variable-length body. See
    [`GatheringByteChannel`](../../../java/nio/channels/GatheringByteChannel.md "interface in java.nio.channels") for more
    information on gathering, and [`GatheringByteChannel.write(ByteBuffer[], int, int)`](../../../java/nio/channels/GatheringByteChannel.md#write(java.nio.ByteBuffer%5B%5D,int,int)) for more information on the subsequence
    behavior.

    Depending on the state of the SSLEngine, this method may produce
    network data without consuming any application data (for example,
    it may generate handshake data.)

    The application is responsible for reliably transporting the
    network data to the peer, and for ensuring that data created by
    multiple calls to wrap() is transported in the same order in which
    it was generated. The application must properly synchronize
    multiple calls to this method.

    If this `SSLEngine` has not yet started its initial
    handshake, this method will automatically start the handshake.

    This method will attempt to produce SSL/TLS/DTLS records, and will
    consume as much source data as possible, but will never consume
    more than the sum of the bytes remaining in each buffer. Each
    `ByteBuffer`'s position is updated to reflect the
    amount of data consumed or produced. The limits remain the
    same.

    The underlying memory used by the `srcs` and
    `dst ByteBuffer`s must not be the same.

    See the class description for more information on engine closure.

    Parameters:
    :   `srcs` - an array of `ByteBuffers` containing the
        outbound application data
    :   `offset` - The offset within the buffer array of the first buffer from
        which bytes are to be retrieved; it must be non-negative
        and no larger than `srcs.length`
    :   `length` - The maximum number of buffers to be accessed; it must be
        non-negative and no larger than
        `srcs.length` - `offset`
    :   `dst` - a `ByteBuffer` to hold outbound network data

    Returns:
    :   an `SSLEngineResult` describing the result
        of this operation.

    Throws:
    :   `SSLException` - A problem was encountered while processing the
        data that caused the `SSLEngine` to abort.

    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if the preconditions on the `offset` and
        `length` parameters do not hold.
    :   `ReadOnlyBufferException` - if the `dst` buffer is read-only.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if either `srcs` or `dst`

    int length)
    throws [SSLException](SSLException.md "class in javax.net.ssl")

    Attempts to decode SSL/TLS/DTLS network data into a subsequence of
    plaintext application data buffers. This *"scattering"*
    operation decodes, in a single invocation, a sequence of bytes
    into one or more of a given sequence of buffers. Scattering
    unwraps are often useful when implementing network protocols or
    file formats that, for example, group data into segments
    consisting of one or more fixed-length headers followed by a
    variable-length body. See
    [`ScatteringByteChannel`](../../../java/nio/channels/ScatteringByteChannel.md "interface in java.nio.channels") for more
    information on scattering, and [`ScatteringByteChannel.read(ByteBuffer[], int, int)`](../../../java/nio/channels/ScatteringByteChannel.md#read(java.nio.ByteBuffer%5B%5D,int,int)) for more information on the subsequence
    behavior.

    Depending on the state of the SSLEngine, this method may consume
    network data without producing any application data (for example,
    it may consume handshake data.)

    The application is responsible for reliably obtaining the network
    data from the peer, and for invoking unwrap() on the data in the
    order it was received. The application must properly synchronize
    multiple calls to this method.

    If this `SSLEngine` has not yet started its initial
    handshake, this method will automatically start the handshake.

    This method will attempt to consume one complete SSL/TLS/DTLS network
    packet, but will never consume more than the sum of the bytes
    remaining in the buffers. Each `ByteBuffer`'s
    position is updated to reflect the amount of data consumed or
    produced. The limits remain the same.

    The underlying memory used by the `src` and
    `dsts ByteBuffer`s must not be the same.

    The inbound network buffer, `src`, may be modified as a result of
    this call: therefore if the network data packet is required for some
    secondary purpose, the data should be duplicated before calling this
    method. Note: the network data will not be useful to a second
    SSLEngine, as each SSLEngine contains unique random state which
    influences the SSL/TLS/DTLS messages.

    See the class description for more information on engine closure.

    Parameters:
    :   `src` - a `ByteBuffer` containing inbound network data.
    :   `dsts` - an array of `ByteBuffer`s to hold inbound
        application data.
    :   `offset` - The offset within the buffer array of the first buffer from
        which bytes are to be transferred; it must be non-negative
        and no larger than `dsts.length`.
    :   `length` - The maximum number of buffers to be accessed; it must be
        non-negative and no larger than
        `dsts.length` - `offset`.

    Returns:
    :   an `SSLEngineResult` describing the result
        of this operation.

    Throws:
    :   `SSLException` - A problem was encountered while processing the
        data that caused the `SSLEngine` to abort.
        See the class description for more information on
        engine closure.
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If the preconditions on the `offset` and
        `length` parameters do not hold.
    :   `ReadOnlyBufferException` - if any of the `dst` buffers are read-only.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if either `src` or `dsts`
        is null, or if any element in the `dsts`
        subsequence specified is null.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the client/server mode
        has not yet been set.

  + ### getDelegatedTask

    public abstract [Runnable](../../../java/lang/Runnable.md "interface in java.lang") getDelegatedTask()

    Returns a delegated `Runnable` task for
    this `SSLEngine`.

    `SSLEngine` operations may require the results of
    operations that block, or may take an extended period of time to
    complete. This method is used to obtain an outstanding [`Runnable`](../../../java/lang/Runnable.md "interface in java.lang") operation (task). Each task must be assigned
    a thread (possibly the current) to perform the [`run`](../../../java/lang/Runnable.md#run()) operation. Once the
    `run` method returns, the `Runnable` object
    is no longer needed and may be discarded.

    Delegated tasks run in the `AccessControlContext`
    in place when this object was created.

    A call to this method will return each outstanding task
    exactly once.

    Multiple delegated tasks can be run in parallel.

    Returns:
    :   a delegated `Runnable` task, or null
        if none are available.
  + ### closeInbound

    public abstract void closeInbound()
    throws [SSLException](SSLException.md "class in javax.net.ssl")

    Signals that no more inbound network data will be sent
    to this `SSLEngine`.

    If the application initiated the closing process by calling
    [`closeOutbound()`](#closeOutbound()), under some circumstances it is not
    required that the initiator wait for the peer's corresponding
    close message. (See section 7.2.1 of the TLS specification ([RFC 2246](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt)) for more
    information on waiting for closure alerts.) In such cases, this
    method need not be called.

    But if the application did not initiate the closure process, or
    if the circumstances above do not apply, this method should be
    called whenever the end of the SSL/TLS/DTLS data stream is reached.
    This ensures closure of the inbound side, and checks that the
    peer followed the SSL/TLS/DTLS close procedure properly, thus
    detecting possible truncation attacks.

    This method is idempotent: if the inbound side has already
    been closed, this method does not do anything.

    [`wrap()`](#wrap(java.nio.ByteBuffer,java.nio.ByteBuffer)) should be
    called to flush any remaining handshake data.

    Throws:
    :   `SSLException` - if this engine has not received the proper SSL/TLS/DTLS close
        notification message from the peer.

  + ### isInboundDone

    public abstract boolean isInboundDone()

    Returns whether [`unwrap(ByteBuffer, ByteBuffer)`](#unwrap(java.nio.ByteBuffer,java.nio.ByteBuffer)) will
    accept any more inbound data messages.

    Returns:
    :   true if the `SSLEngine` will not
        consume any more network data (and by implication,
        will not produce any more application data.)

    See Also:
    :   - [`closeInbound()`](#closeInbound())
  + ### closeOutbound

    public abstract void closeOutbound()

    Signals that no more outbound application data will be sent
    on this `SSLEngine`.

    This method is idempotent: if the outbound side has already
    been closed, this method does not do anything.

    [`wrap(ByteBuffer, ByteBuffer)`](#wrap(java.nio.ByteBuffer,java.nio.ByteBuffer)) should be
    called to flush any remaining handshake data.

    See Also:
    :   - [`isOutboundDone()`](#isOutboundDone())
  + ### isOutboundDone

    public abstract boolean isOutboundDone()

    Returns whether [`wrap(ByteBuffer, ByteBuffer)`](#wrap(java.nio.ByteBuffer,java.nio.ByteBuffer)) will
    produce any more outbound data messages.

    Note that during the closure phase, a `SSLEngine` may
    generate handshake closure data that must be sent to the peer.
    `wrap()` must be called to generate this data. When
    this method returns true, no more outbound data will be created.

    Returns:
    :   true if the `SSLEngine` will not produce
        any more network data

  + ### getSupportedCipherSuites

    public abstract [String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] getSupportedCipherSuites()

    Returns the names of the cipher suites which could be enabled for use
    on this engine. Normally, only a subset of these will actually
    be enabled by default, since this list may include cipher suites which
    do not meet quality of service requirements for those defaults. Such
    cipher suites might be useful in specialized applications.

    The returned array includes cipher suites from the list of standard
    cipher suite names in the [JSSE Cipher Suite Names](../../../../../specs/security/standard-names.md#jsse-cipher-suite-names) section of the Java Security Standard
    Algorithm Names Specification, and may also include other cipher
    suites that the provider supports.

    Returns:
    :   an array of cipher suite names

    See Also:
    :   - [`getEnabledCipherSuites()`](#getEnabledCipherSuites())
        - [`setEnabledCipherSuites(String[])`](#setEnabledCipherSuites(java.lang.String%5B%5D))
  + ### getEnabledCipherSuites

    public abstract [String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] getEnabledCipherSuites()

    Returns the names of the SSL cipher suites which are currently
    enabled for use on this engine. When an SSLEngine is first
    created, all enabled cipher suites support a minimum quality of
    service. Thus, in some environments this value might be empty.

    Note that even if a suite is enabled, it may never be used. This
    can occur if the peer does not support it, or its use is restricted,
    or the requisite certificates (and private keys) for the suite are
    not available, or an anonymous suite is enabled but authentication
    is required.

    The returned array includes cipher suites from the list of standard
    cipher suite names in the [JSSE Cipher Suite Names](../../../../../specs/security/standard-names.md#jsse-cipher-suite-names) section of the Java Security Standard
    Algorithm Names Specification, and may also include other cipher
    suites that the provider supports.

  + ### setEnabledCipherSuites

    public abstract void setEnabledCipherSuites([String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] suites)

    Sets the cipher suites enabled for use on this engine.

    Each cipher suite in the `suites` parameter must have
    been listed by getSupportedCipherSuites(), or the method will
    fail. Following a successful call to this method, only suites
    listed in the `suites` parameter are enabled for use.

    Note that the standard list of cipher suite names may be found in the
    [JSSE Cipher Suite Names](../../../../../specs/security/standard-names.md#jsse-cipher-suite-names) section of the Java Security Standard
    Algorithm Names Specification. Providers may support cipher suite
    names not found in this list or might not use the recommended name
    for a certain cipher suite.

    See [`getEnabledCipherSuites()`](#getEnabledCipherSuites()) for more information
    on why a specific cipher suite may never be used on an engine.

    Parameters:
    :   `suites` - Names of all the cipher suites to enable

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - when one or more of the ciphers
        named by the parameter is not supported, or when the
        parameter is null.

    public abstract [String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] getSupportedProtocols()

    Returns the names of the protocols which could be enabled for use
    with this `SSLEngine`.

    Returns:
    :   an array of protocols supported
  + ### getEnabledProtocols

    public abstract [String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] getEnabledProtocols()

    Returns the names of the protocol versions which are currently
    enabled for use with this `SSLEngine`.

    Note that even if a protocol is enabled, it may never be used.
    This can occur if the peer does not support the protocol, or its
    use is restricted, or there are no enabled cipher suites supported
    by the protocol.

    Returns:
    :   an array of protocols

    See Also:
    :   - [`setEnabledProtocols(String[])`](#setEnabledProtocols(java.lang.String%5B%5D))
  + ### setEnabledProtocols

    public abstract void setEnabledProtocols([String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] protocols)

    Set the protocol versions enabled for use on this engine.

    The protocols must have been listed by getSupportedProtocols()
    as being supported. Following a successful call to this method,
    only protocols listed in the `protocols` parameter
    are enabled for use.

    Parameters:
    :   `protocols` - Names of all the protocols to enable.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - when one or more of
        the protocols named by the parameter is not supported or
        when the protocols parameter is null.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getEnabledProtocols()`](#getEnabledProtocols())
  + ### getSession

    public abstract [SSLSession](SSLSession.md "interface in javax.net.ssl") getSession()

    Returns the `SSLSession` in use in this
    `SSLEngine`.

    These can be long-lived, and frequently correspond to an entire
    login session for some user. The session specifies a particular
    cipher suite which is being actively used by all connections in
    that session, as well as the identities of the session's client
    and server.

    Unlike [`SSLSocket.getSession()`](SSLSocket.md#getSession())
    this method does not block until handshaking is complete.

    Until the initial handshake has completed, this method returns
    a session object which reports an invalid cipher suite of
    "SSL\_NULL\_WITH\_NULL\_NULL".

    Returns:
    :   the `SSLSession` for this `SSLEngine`

    See Also:
    :   - [`SSLSession`](SSLSession.md "interface in javax.net.ssl")
  + ### getHandshakeSession

    public [SSLSession](SSLSession.md "interface in javax.net.ssl") getHandshakeSession()

    Returns the `SSLSession` being constructed during a SSL/TLS/DTLS
    handshake.

    TLS/DTLS protocols may negotiate parameters that are needed when using
    an instance of this class, but before the `SSLSession` has
    been completely initialized and made available via `getSession`.
    For example, the list of valid signature algorithms may restrict
    the type of certificates that can be used during TrustManager
    decisions, or the maximum TLS/DTLS fragment packet sizes can be
    resized to better support the network environment.

    This method provides early access to the `SSLSession` being
    constructed. Depending on how far the handshake has progressed,
    some data may not yet be available for use. For example, if a
    remote server will be sending a Certificate chain, but that chain
    has yet not been processed, the `getPeerCertificates`
    method of `SSLSession` will throw a
    SSLPeerUnverifiedException. Once that chain has been processed,
    `getPeerCertificates` will return the proper value.

    Returns:
    :   null if this instance is not currently handshaking, or
        if the current handshake has not progressed far enough to
        create a basic SSLSession. Otherwise, this method returns the
        `SSLSession` currently being negotiated.

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the underlying provider
        does not implement the operation.

    Initiates handshaking (initial or renegotiation) on this SSLEngine.

    This method is not needed for the initial handshake, as the
    `wrap()` and `unwrap()` methods will
    implicitly call this method if handshaking has not already begun.

    Note that the peer may also request a session renegotiation with
    this `SSLEngine` by sending the appropriate
    session renegotiate handshake message.

    Unlike the [`SSLSocket#startHandshake()`](SSLSocket.md#startHandshake()) method, this method does not block
    until handshaking is completed.

    To force a complete SSL/TLS/DTLS session renegotiation, the current
    session should be invalidated prior to calling this method.

    Some protocols may not support multiple handshakes on an existing
    engine and may throw an `SSLException`.

    Throws:
    :   `SSLException` - if a problem was encountered while signaling the
        `SSLEngine` to begin a new handshake.
        See the class description for more information on
        engine closure.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the client/server mode
        has not yet been set.

  + ### getHandshakeStatus

    public abstract [SSLEngineResult.HandshakeStatus](SSLEngineResult.HandshakeStatus.md "enum class in javax.net.ssl") getHandshakeStatus()

    Returns the current handshake status for this `SSLEngine`.

    Returns:
    :   the current `SSLEngineResult.HandshakeStatus`.
  + ### setUseClientMode

    public abstract void setUseClientMode(boolean mode)

    Configures the engine to use client (or server) mode when
    handshaking.

    This method must be called before any handshaking occurs.
    Once handshaking has begun, the mode can not be reset for the
    life of this engine.

    Servers normally authenticate themselves, and clients
    are not required to do so.

    Parameters:
    :   `mode` - true if the engine should start its handshaking
        in "client" mode

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if a mode change is attempted
        after the initial handshake has begun.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getUseClientMode()`](#getUseClientMode())
  + ### getUseClientMode

    public abstract boolean getUseClientMode()

    Returns true if the engine is set to use client mode when
    handshaking.

    Returns:
    :   true if the engine should do handshaking
        in "client" mode

    See Also:
    :   - [`setUseClientMode(boolean)`](#setUseClientMode(boolean))
  + ### setNeedClientAuth

    public abstract void setNeedClientAuth(boolean need)

    Configures the engine to *require* client authentication. This
    option is only useful for engines in the server mode.

    An engine's client authentication setting is one of the following:
    - client authentication required- client authentication requested- no client authentication desired

    Unlike [`setWantClientAuth(boolean)`](#setWantClientAuth(boolean)), if this option is set and
    the client chooses not to provide authentication information
    about itself, *the negotiations will stop and the engine will
    begin its closure procedure*.

    Calling this method overrides any previous setting made by
    this method or [`setWantClientAuth(boolean)`](#setWantClientAuth(boolean)).

    Parameters:
    :   `need` - set to true if client authentication is required,
        or false if no client authentication is desired.

  + ### setWantClientAuth

    public abstract void setWantClientAuth(boolean want)

    Configures the engine to *request* client authentication.
    This option is only useful for engines in the server mode.

    An engine's client authentication setting is one of the following:
    - client authentication required- client authentication requested- no client authentication desired

    Unlike [`setNeedClientAuth(boolean)`](#setNeedClientAuth(boolean)), if this option is set and
    the client chooses not to provide authentication information
    about itself, *the negotiations will continue*.

    Calling this method overrides any previous setting made by
    this method or [`setNeedClientAuth(boolean)`](#setNeedClientAuth(boolean)).

    Parameters:
    :   `want` - set to true if client authentication is requested,
        or false if no client authentication is desired.

  + ### setEnableSessionCreation

    public abstract void setEnableSessionCreation(boolean flag)

    Controls whether new SSL sessions may be established by this engine.
    If session creations are not allowed, and there are no
    existing sessions to resume, there will be no successful
    handshaking.

    Parameters:
    :   `flag` - true indicates that sessions may be created; this
        is the default. false indicates that an existing session
        must be resumed

    See Also:
    :   - [`getEnableSessionCreation()`](#getEnableSessionCreation())
  + ### getEnableSessionCreation

    public abstract boolean getEnableSessionCreation()

    Returns true if new SSL sessions may be established by this engine.

    Returns:
    :   true indicates that sessions may be created; this
        is the default. false indicates that an existing session
        must be resumed

  + ### getSSLParameters

    public [SSLParameters](SSLParameters.md "class in javax.net.ssl") getSSLParameters()

    Returns the SSLParameters in effect for this SSLEngine.
    The ciphersuites and protocols of the returned SSLParameters
    are always non-null.

    Returns:
    :   the SSLParameters in effect for this SSLEngine.

    Since:
    :   1.6
  + ### setSSLParameters

    public void setSSLParameters([SSLParameters](SSLParameters.md "class in javax.net.ssl") params)

    Applies SSLParameters to this engine.

    This means:
    - If `params.getCipherSuites()` is non-null,
      `setEnabledCipherSuites()` is called with that value.
    - If `params.getProtocols()` is non-null,
      `setEnabledProtocols()` is called with that value.
    - If `params.getNeedClientAuth()` or
      `params.getWantClientAuth()` return `true`,
      `setNeedClientAuth(true)` and
      `setWantClientAuth(true)` are called, respectively;
      otherwise `setWantClientAuth(false)` is called.
    - If `params.getServerNames()` is non-null, the engine will
      configure its server names with that value.
    - If `params.getSNIMatchers()` is non-null, the engine will
      configure its SNI matchers with that value.

    Parameters:
    :   `params` - the parameters

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the setEnabledCipherSuites() or
        the setEnabledProtocols() call fails

    Since:
    :   1.6
  + ### getApplicationProtocol

    public [String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getApplicationProtocol()

    Returns the most recent application protocol value negotiated for this
    connection.

    If supported by the underlying SSL/TLS/DTLS implementation,
    application name negotiation mechanisms such as  [RFC 7301](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7301.txt) , the
    Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN), can negotiate
    application-level values between peers.

    Returns:
    :   null if it has not yet been determined if application
        protocols might be used for this connection, an empty
        `String` if application protocols values will not
        be used, or a non-empty application protocol `String`
        if a value was successfully negotiated.

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the underlying provider
        does not implement the operation.

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### getHandshakeApplicationProtocol

    public [String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getHandshakeApplicationProtocol()

    Returns the application protocol value negotiated on a SSL/TLS
    handshake currently in progress.

    Like [`getHandshakeSession()`](#getHandshakeSession()),
    a connection may be in the middle of a handshake. The
    application protocol may or may not yet be available.

    Returns:
    :   null if it has not yet been determined if application
        protocols might be used for this handshake, an empty
        `String` if application protocols values will not
        be used, or a non-empty application protocol `String`
        if a value was successfully negotiated.

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the underlying provider
        does not implement the operation.

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector

    public void setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector([BiFunction](../../../java/util/function/BiFunction.md "interface in java.util.function")<[SSLEngine](SSLEngine.md "class in javax.net.ssl"),[List](../../../java/util/List.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")>,[String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> selector)

    Registers a callback function that selects an application protocol
    value for a SSL/TLS/DTLS handshake.
    The function overrides any values supplied using
    [`SSLParameters.setApplicationProtocols`](SSLParameters.md#setApplicationProtocols(java.lang.String%5B%5D)) and it supports the following
    type parameters:
    > `SSLEngine`: The function's first argument allows the current `SSLEngine` to be inspected, including the handshake session and configuration settings. `List<String>`: The function's second argument lists the application protocol names advertised by the TLS peer. `String`: The function's result is an application protocol name, or null to indicate that none of the advertised names are acceptable. If the return value is an empty `String` then application protocol indications will not be used. If the return value is null (no value chosen) or is a value that was not advertised by the peer, the underlying protocol will determine what action to take. (For example, ALPN will send a "no\_application\_protocol" alert and terminate the connection.)

    For example, the following call registers a callback function that
    examines the TLS handshake parameters and selects an application protocol
    name:

    ```
         serverEngine.setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector(
             (serverEngine, clientProtocols) -> {
                 SSLSession session = serverEngine.getHandshakeSession();
                 return chooseApplicationProtocol(
                     serverEngine,
                     clientProtocols,
                     session.getProtocol(),
                     session.getCipherSuite());
             });
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `selector` - the callback function, or null to disable the callback
        functionality.

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the underlying provider
        does not implement the operation.

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### getHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector

    public [BiFunction](../../../java/util/function/BiFunction.md "interface in java.util.function")<[SSLEngine](SSLEngine.md "class in javax.net.ssl"),[List](../../../java/util/List.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")>,[String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> getHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector()

    Retrieves the callback function that selects an application protocol
    value during a SSL/TLS/DTLS handshake.
    See [`setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector`](#setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector(java.util.function.BiFunction))
    for the function's type parameters.

    Returns:
    :   the callback function, or null if none has been set.

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the underlying provider
        does not implement the operation.

    Since:
