public abstract class SSLServerSocket
extends [ServerSocket](../../../java/net/ServerSocket.md "class in java.net")

This class extends `ServerSocket` and
provides secure server sockets using protocols such as the Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols.

Instances of this class are generally created using an
`SSLServerSocketFactory`. The primary function
of an `SSLServerSocket`
is to create `SSLSocket`s by `accept`ing
connections.

An `SSLServerSocket` contains several pieces of state data
which are inherited by the `SSLSocket` at
socket creation. These include the enabled cipher
suites and protocols, whether client
authentication is necessary, and whether created sockets should
begin handshaking in client or server mode. The state
inherited by the created `SSLSocket` can be
overridden by calling the appropriate methods.

:   1.4

  + ### SSLServerSocket

    protected SSLServerSocket()
    throws [IOException](../../../java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Used only by subclasses.

    Create an unbound TCP server socket using the default authentication
    context.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs when creating the socket
  + ### SSLServerSocket

    protected SSLServerSocket(int port)
    throws [IOException](../../../java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Used only by subclasses.

    Create a TCP server socket on a port, using the default
    authentication context. The connection backlog defaults to
    fifty connections queued up before the system starts to
    reject new connection requests.

    A port number of `0` creates a socket on any free port.

    If there is a security manager, its `checkListen`
    method is called with the `port` argument as its
    argument to ensure the operation is allowed. This could result
    in a SecurityException.

    Parameters:
    :   `port` - the port on which to listen

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs when creating the socket
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its
        `checkListen` method doesn't allow the operation.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the port parameter is outside the
        specified range of valid port values, which is between 0 and
        65535, inclusive.

  + ### SSLServerSocket

    protected SSLServerSocket(int port,
    int backlog)
    throws [IOException](../../../java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Used only by subclasses.

    Create a TCP server socket on a port, using the default
    authentication context and a specified backlog of connections.

    A port number of `0` creates a socket on any free port.

    The `backlog` argument is the requested maximum number of
    pending connections on the socket. Its exact semantics are implementation
    specific. In particular, an implementation may impose a maximum length
    or may choose to ignore the parameter altogether. The value provided
    should be greater than `0`. If it is less than or equal to
    `0`, then an implementation specific default will be used.

    If there is a security manager, its `checkListen`
    method is called with the `port` argument as its
    argument to ensure the operation is allowed. This could result
    in a SecurityException.

    Parameters:
    :   `port` - the port on which to listen
    :   `backlog` - requested maximum length of the queue of incoming
        connections.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs when creating the socket
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its
        `checkListen` method doesn't allow the operation.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the port parameter is outside the
        specified range of valid port values, which is between 0 and
        65535, inclusive.

  + ### SSLServerSocket

    protected SSLServerSocket(int port,
    int backlog,
    [InetAddress](../../../java/net/InetAddress.md "class in java.net") address)
    throws [IOException](../../../java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Used only by subclasses.

    Create a TCP server socket on a port, using the default
    authentication context and a specified backlog of connections
    as well as a particular specified network interface. This
    constructor is used on multihomed hosts, such as those used
    for firewalls or as routers, to control through which interface
    a network service is provided.

    If there is a security manager, its `checkListen`
    method is called with the `port` argument as its
    argument to ensure the operation is allowed. This could result
    in a SecurityException.

    A port number of `0` creates a socket on any free port.

    The `backlog` argument is the requested maximum number of
    pending connections on the socket. Its exact semantics are implementation
    specific. In particular, an implementation may impose a maximum length
    or may choose to ignore the parameter altogether. The value provided
    should be greater than `0`. If it is less than or equal to
    `0`, then an implementation specific default will be used.

    If *address* is null, it will default accepting connections
    on any/all local addresses.

    Parameters:
    :   `port` - the port on which to listen
    :   `backlog` - requested maximum length of the queue of incoming
        connections.
    :   `address` - the address of the network interface through
        which connections will be accepted

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs when creating the socket
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its
        `checkListen` method doesn't allow the operation.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the port parameter is outside the
        specified range of valid port values, which is between 0 and
        65535, inclusive.

* ## Method Details

  + ### getEnabledCipherSuites

    public abstract [String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] getEnabledCipherSuites()

    Returns the list of cipher suites which are currently enabled
    for use by newly accepted connections.

    If this list has not been explicitly modified, a system-provided
    default guarantees a minimum quality of service in all enabled
    cipher suites.

    Note that even if a suite is enabled, it may never be used. This
    can occur if the peer does not support it, or its use is restricted,
    or the requisite certificates (and private keys) for the suite are
    not available, or an anonymous suite is enabled but authentication
    is required.

    The returned array includes cipher suites from the list of standard
    cipher suite names in the [JSSE Cipher Suite Names](../../../../../specs/security/standard-names.md#jsse-cipher-suite-names) section of the Java Security Standard
    Algorithm Names Specification, and may also include other cipher
    suites that the provider supports.

    Returns:
    :   an array of cipher suites enabled

    See Also:
    :   - [`getSupportedCipherSuites()`](#getSupportedCipherSuites())
        - [`setEnabledCipherSuites(String[])`](#setEnabledCipherSuites(java.lang.String%5B%5D))
  + ### setEnabledCipherSuites

    public abstract void setEnabledCipherSuites([String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] suites)

    Sets the cipher suites enabled for use by accepted connections.

    The cipher suites must have been listed by getSupportedCipherSuites()
    as being supported. Following a successful call to this method,
    only suites listed in the `suites` parameter are enabled
    for use.

    Suites that require authentication information which is not available
    in this ServerSocket's authentication context will not be used
    in any case, even if they are enabled.

    Note that the standard list of cipher suite names may be found in the
    [JSSE Cipher Suite Names](../../../../../specs/security/standard-names.md#jsse-cipher-suite-names) section of the Java Security Standard
    Algorithm Names Specification. Providers may support cipher suite
    names not found in this list or might not use the recommended name
    for a certain cipher suite.

    `SSLSocket`s returned from `accept()`
    inherit this setting.

    Parameters:
    :   `suites` - Names of all the cipher suites to enable

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - when one or more of ciphers
        named by the parameter is not supported, or when
        the parameter is null.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getSupportedCipherSuites()`](#getSupportedCipherSuites())
        - [`getEnabledCipherSuites()`](#getEnabledCipherSuites())
  + ### getSupportedCipherSuites

    public abstract [String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] getSupportedCipherSuites()

    Returns the names of the cipher suites which could be enabled for use
    on an SSL connection.

    Normally, only a subset of these will actually
    be enabled by default, since this list may include cipher suites which
    do not meet quality of service requirements for those defaults. Such
    cipher suites are useful in specialized applications.

    The returned array includes cipher suites from the list of standard
    cipher suite names in the [JSSE Cipher Suite Names](../../../../../specs/security/standard-names.md#jsse-cipher-suite-names) section of the Java Security Standard
    Algorithm Names Specification, and may also include other cipher
    suites that the provider supports.

    Returns:
    :   an array of cipher suite names

    :   - [`getEnabledCipherSuites()`](#getEnabledCipherSuites())
        - [`setEnabledCipherSuites(String[])`](#setEnabledCipherSuites(java.lang.String%5B%5D))
  + ### getSupportedProtocols

    public abstract [String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] getSupportedProtocols()

    Returns the names of the protocols which could be enabled for use.

    Returns:
    :   an array of protocol names supported

    See Also:
    :   - [`getEnabledProtocols()`](#getEnabledProtocols())
        - [`setEnabledProtocols(String[])`](#setEnabledProtocols(java.lang.String%5B%5D))
  + ### getEnabledProtocols

    public abstract [String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] getEnabledProtocols()

    Returns the names of the protocols which are currently
    enabled for use by the newly accepted connections.

    Note that even if a protocol is enabled, it may never be used.
    This can occur if the peer does not support the protocol, or its
    use is restricted, or there are no enabled cipher suites supported
    by the protocol.

    Returns:
    :   an array of protocol names

    See Also:
    :   - [`getSupportedProtocols()`](#getSupportedProtocols())
        - [`setEnabledProtocols(String[])`](#setEnabledProtocols(java.lang.String%5B%5D))
  + ### setEnabledProtocols

    public abstract void setEnabledProtocols([String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] protocols)

    Controls which particular protocols are enabled for use by
    accepted connections.

    The protocols must have been listed by
    getSupportedProtocols() as being supported.
    Following a successful call to this method, only protocols listed
    in the `protocols` parameter are enabled for use.

    `SSLSocket`s returned from `accept()`
    inherit this setting.

    Parameters:
    :   `protocols` - Names of all the protocols to enable.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - when one or more of
        the protocols named by the parameter is not supported or
        when the protocols parameter is null.

        - [`getSupportedProtocols()`](#getSupportedProtocols())
  + ### setNeedClientAuth

    public abstract void setNeedClientAuth(boolean need)

    Controls whether `accept`ed server-mode
    `SSLSockets` will be initially configured to
    *require* client authentication.

    A socket's client authentication setting is one of the following:
    - client authentication required- client authentication requested- no client authentication desired

    Unlike [`setWantClientAuth(boolean)`](#setWantClientAuth(boolean)), if the accepted
    socket's option is set and the client chooses not to provide
    authentication information about itself, *the negotiations
    will stop and the connection will be dropped*.

    Calling this method overrides any previous setting made by
    this method or [`setWantClientAuth(boolean)`](#setWantClientAuth(boolean)).

    The initial inherited setting may be overridden by calling
    [`SSLSocket.setNeedClientAuth(boolean)`](SSLSocket.md#setNeedClientAuth(boolean)) or
    [`SSLSocket.setWantClientAuth(boolean)`](SSLSocket.md#setWantClientAuth(boolean)).

    Parameters:
    :   `need` - set to true if client authentication is required,
        or false if no client authentication is desired.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getNeedClientAuth()`](#getNeedClientAuth())
        - [`setWantClientAuth(boolean)`](#setWantClientAuth(boolean))
        - [`getWantClientAuth()`](#getWantClientAuth())
        - [`setUseClientMode(boolean)`](#setUseClientMode(boolean))
  + ### getNeedClientAuth

    public abstract boolean getNeedClientAuth()

    Returns true if client authentication will be *required* on
    newly `accept`ed server-mode `SSLSocket`s.

    The initial inherited setting may be overridden by calling
    [`SSLSocket.setNeedClientAuth(boolean)`](SSLSocket.md#setNeedClientAuth(boolean)) or
    [`SSLSocket.setWantClientAuth(boolean)`](SSLSocket.md#setWantClientAuth(boolean)).

    Returns:
    :   true if client authentication is required,
        or false if no client authentication is desired.

    See Also:
    :   - [`setNeedClientAuth(boolean)`](#setNeedClientAuth(boolean))
        - [`setWantClientAuth(boolean)`](#setWantClientAuth(boolean))
        - [`getWantClientAuth()`](#getWantClientAuth())
        - [`setUseClientMode(boolean)`](#setUseClientMode(boolean))
  + ### setWantClientAuth

    public abstract void setWantClientAuth(boolean want)

    Controls whether `accept`ed server-mode
    `SSLSockets` will be initially configured to
    *request* client authentication.

    A socket's client authentication setting is one of the following:
    - client authentication required- client authentication requested- no client authentication desired

    Unlike [`setNeedClientAuth(boolean)`](#setNeedClientAuth(boolean)), if the accepted
    socket's option is set and the client chooses not to provide
    authentication information about itself, *the negotiations
    will continue*.

    Calling this method overrides any previous setting made by
    this method or [`setNeedClientAuth(boolean)`](#setNeedClientAuth(boolean)).

    The initial inherited setting may be overridden by calling
    [`SSLSocket.setNeedClientAuth(boolean)`](SSLSocket.md#setNeedClientAuth(boolean)) or
    [`SSLSocket.setWantClientAuth(boolean)`](SSLSocket.md#setWantClientAuth(boolean)).

    Parameters:
    :   `want` - set to true if client authentication is requested,
        or false if no client authentication is desired.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getWantClientAuth()`](#getWantClientAuth())

        - [`getNeedClientAuth()`](#getNeedClientAuth())
        - [`setUseClientMode(boolean)`](#setUseClientMode(boolean))
  + ### getWantClientAuth

    public abstract boolean getWantClientAuth()

    Returns true if client authentication will be *requested* on
    newly accepted server-mode connections.

    The initial inherited setting may be overridden by calling
    [`SSLSocket.setNeedClientAuth(boolean)`](SSLSocket.md#setNeedClientAuth(boolean)) or
    [`SSLSocket.setWantClientAuth(boolean)`](SSLSocket.md#setWantClientAuth(boolean)).

    Returns:
    :   true if client authentication is requested,
        or false if no client authentication is desired.

    See Also:
    :   - [`setWantClientAuth(boolean)`](#setWantClientAuth(boolean))
        - [`setNeedClientAuth(boolean)`](#setNeedClientAuth(boolean))
        - [`getNeedClientAuth()`](#getNeedClientAuth())
        - [`setUseClientMode(boolean)`](#setUseClientMode(boolean))
  + ### setUseClientMode

    public abstract void setUseClientMode(boolean mode)

    Controls whether accepted connections are in the (default) SSL
    server mode, or the SSL client mode.

    Servers normally authenticate themselves, and clients are not
    required to do so.

    In rare cases, TCP servers
    need to act in the SSL client mode on newly accepted
    connections. For example, FTP clients acquire server sockets
    and listen there for reverse connections from the server. An
    FTP client would use an SSLServerSocket in "client" mode to
    accept the reverse connection while the FTP server uses an
    SSLSocket with "client" mode disabled to initiate the
    connection. During the resulting handshake, existing SSL
    sessions may be reused.

    `SSLSocket`s returned from `accept()`
    inherit this setting.

    Parameters:
    :   `mode` - true if newly accepted connections should use SSL
        client mode.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getUseClientMode()`](#getUseClientMode())
  + ### getUseClientMode

    public abstract boolean getUseClientMode()

    Returns true if accepted connections will be in SSL client mode.

    Returns:
    :   true if the connection should use SSL client mode.

    See Also:
    :   - [`setUseClientMode(boolean)`](#setUseClientMode(boolean))
  + ### setEnableSessionCreation

    public abstract void setEnableSessionCreation(boolean flag)

    Controls whether new SSL sessions may be established by the
    sockets which are created from this server socket.

    `SSLSocket`s returned from `accept()`
    inherit this setting.

    Parameters:
    :   `flag` - true indicates that sessions may be created; this
        is the default. false indicates that an existing session
        must be resumed.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getEnableSessionCreation()`](#getEnableSessionCreation())
  + ### getEnableSessionCreation

    public abstract boolean getEnableSessionCreation()

    Returns true if new SSL sessions may be established by the
    sockets which are created from this server socket.

    Returns:
    :   true indicates that sessions may be created; this
        is the default. false indicates that an existing
        session must be resumed

    See Also:
    :   - [`setEnableSessionCreation(boolean)`](#setEnableSessionCreation(boolean))
  + ### getSSLParameters

    public [SSLParameters](SSLParameters.md "class in javax.net.ssl") getSSLParameters()

    Returns the SSLParameters in effect for newly accepted connections.
    The ciphersuites and protocols of the returned SSLParameters
    are always non-null.

    Returns:
    :   the SSLParameters in effect for newly accepted connections

    Since:
    :   1.7

    See Also:
    :   - [`setSSLParameters(SSLParameters)`](#setSSLParameters(javax.net.ssl.SSLParameters))
  + ### setSSLParameters

    public void setSSLParameters([SSLParameters](SSLParameters.md "class in javax.net.ssl") params)

    Applies SSLParameters to newly accepted connections.

    This means:
    - If `params.getCipherSuites()` is non-null,
      `setEnabledCipherSuites()` is called with that value.
    - If `params.getProtocols()` is non-null,
      `setEnabledProtocols()` is called with that value.
    - If `params.getNeedClientAuth()` or
      `params.getWantClientAuth()` return `true`,
      `setNeedClientAuth(true)` and
      `setWantClientAuth(true)` are called, respectively;
      otherwise `setWantClientAuth(false)` is called.
    - If `params.getServerNames()` is non-null, the socket will
      configure its server names with that value.
    - If `params.getSNIMatchers()` is non-null, the socket will
      configure its SNI matchers with that value.

    Parameters:
    :   `params` - the parameters

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the setEnabledCipherSuites() or
        the setEnabledProtocols() call fails
