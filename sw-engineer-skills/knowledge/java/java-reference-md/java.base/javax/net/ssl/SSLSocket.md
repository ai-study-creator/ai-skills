public abstract class SSLSocket
extends [Socket](../../../java/net/Socket.md "class in java.net")

This class extends `Socket` and provides secure
sockets using protocols such as the "Secure
Sockets Layer" (SSL) or IETF "Transport Layer Security" (TLS) protocols.

Such sockets are normal stream sockets, but they
add a layer of security protections over the underlying network transport
protocol, such as TCP. Those protections include:

* *Integrity Protection*. SSL protects against
  modification of messages by an active wiretapper.* *Authentication*. In most modes, SSL provides
    peer authentication. Servers are usually authenticated,
    and clients may be authenticated as requested by servers.* *Confidentiality (Privacy Protection)*. In most
      modes, SSL encrypts data being sent between client and server.
      This protects the confidentiality of data, so that passive
      wiretappers won't see sensitive data such as financial
      information or personal information of many kinds.

These kinds of protection are specified by a "cipher suite", which
is a combination of cryptographic algorithms used by a given SSL connection.
During the negotiation process, the two endpoints must agree on
a ciphersuite that is available in both environments.
If there is no such suite in common, no SSL connection can
be established, and no data can be exchanged.

The cipher suite used is established by a negotiation process
called "handshaking". The goal of this
process is to create or rejoin a "session", which may protect many
connections over time. After handshaking has completed, you can access
session attributes by using the *getSession* method.
The initial handshake on this connection can be initiated in
one of three ways:

* calling `startHandshake` which explicitly
  begins handshakes, or* any attempt to read or write application data on
    this socket causes an implicit handshake, or* a call to `getSession` tries to set up a session
      if there is no currently valid session, and
      an implicit handshake is done.

If handshaking fails for any reason, the `SSLSocket`
is closed, and no further communications can be done.

There are two groups of cipher suites which you will need to know
about when managing cipher suites:

* *Supported* cipher suites: all the suites which are
  supported by the SSL implementation. This list is reported
  using *getSupportedCipherSuites*.* *Enabled* cipher suites, which may be fewer
    than the full set of supported suites. This group is
    set using the *setEnabledCipherSuites* method, and
    queried using the *getEnabledCipherSuites* method.
    Initially, a default set of cipher suites will be enabled on
    a new socket that represents the minimum suggested configuration.

Implementation defaults require that only cipher
suites which authenticate servers and provide confidentiality
be enabled by default.
Only if both sides explicitly agree to unauthenticated and/or
non-private (unencrypted) communications will such a ciphersuite be
selected.

When an `SSLSocket` is first created, no handshaking
is done so that applications may first set their communication
preferences: what cipher suites to use, whether the socket should be
in client or server mode, etc.
However, security is always provided by the time that application data
is sent over the connection.

You may register to receive event notification of handshake
completion. This involves
the use of two additional classes. *HandshakeCompletedEvent*
objects are passed to *HandshakeCompletedListener* instances,
which are registered by users of this API.
An `SSLSocket` is created by `SSLSocketFactory`,
or by `accept`ing a connection from a
`SSLServerSocket`.

A SSL socket must choose to operate in the client or server mode.
This will determine who begins the handshaking process, as well
as which messages should be sent by each party. Each
connection must have one client and one server, or handshaking
will not progress properly. Once the initial handshaking has started, a
socket can not switch between client and server modes, even when
performing renegotiations.

The ApplicationProtocol `String` values returned by the methods
in this class are in the network byte representation sent by the peer.
The bytes could be directly compared, or converted to its Unicode
`String` format for comparison.
> ```
>      String networkString = sslSocket.getHandshakeApplicationProtocol();
>      byte[] bytes = networkString.getBytes(StandardCharsets.ISO_8859_1);
>

* ## Method Details

  + ### getSupportedCipherSuites

    public abstract [String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] getSupportedCipherSuites()

    Returns the names of the cipher suites which could be enabled for use
    on this connection. Normally, only a subset of these will actually
    be enabled by default, since this list may include cipher suites which
    do not meet quality of service requirements for those defaults. Such
    cipher suites might be useful in specialized applications.

    The returned array includes cipher suites from the list of standard
    cipher suite names in the [JSSE Cipher Suite Names](../../../../../specs/security/standard-names.md#jsse-cipher-suite-names) section of the Java Security Standard
    Algorithm Names Specification, and may also include other cipher
    suites that the provider supports.

    Returns:
    :   an array of cipher suite names

    See Also:
    :   - [`getEnabledCipherSuites()`](#getEnabledCipherSuites())
        - [`setEnabledCipherSuites(String [])`](#setEnabledCipherSuites(java.lang.String%5B%5D))
  + ### getEnabledCipherSuites

    public abstract [String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] getEnabledCipherSuites()

    Returns the names of the SSL cipher suites which are currently
    enabled for use on this connection. When an SSLSocket is first
    created, all enabled cipher suites support a minimum quality of
    service. Thus, in some environments this value might be empty.

    Note that even if a suite is enabled, it may never be used. This
    can occur if the peer does not support it, or its use is restricted,
    or the requisite certificates (and private keys) for the suite are
    not available, or an anonymous suite is enabled but authentication
    is required.

    The returned array includes cipher suites from the list of standard
    cipher suite names in the [JSSE Cipher Suite Names](../../../../../specs/security/standard-names.md#jsse-cipher-suite-names) section of the Java Security Standard
    Algorithm Names Specification, and may also include other cipher
    suites that the provider supports.

    Returns:
    :   an array of cipher suite names

    See Also:
    :   - [`getSupportedCipherSuites()`](#getSupportedCipherSuites())
        - [`setEnabledCipherSuites(String [])`](#setEnabledCipherSuites(java.lang.String%5B%5D))
  + ### setEnabledCipherSuites

    public abstract void setEnabledCipherSuites([String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] suites)

    Sets the cipher suites enabled for use on this connection.

    Each cipher suite in the `suites` parameter must have
    been listed by getSupportedCipherSuites(), or the method will
    fail. Following a successful call to this method, only suites
    listed in the `suites` parameter are enabled for use.

    Note that the standard list of cipher suite names may be found in the
    [JSSE Cipher Suite Names](../../../../../specs/security/standard-names.md#jsse-cipher-suite-names) section of the Java Security Standard
    Algorithm Names Specification. Providers may support cipher suite
    names not found in this list or might not use the recommended name
    for a certain cipher suite.

    See [`getEnabledCipherSuites()`](#getEnabledCipherSuites()) for more information
    on why a specific ciphersuite may never be used on a connection.

    Parameters:
    :   `suites` - Names of all the cipher suites to enable

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - when one or more of the ciphers
        named by the parameter is not supported, or when the
        parameter is null.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getSupportedCipherSuites()`](#getSupportedCipherSuites())
        - [`getEnabledCipherSuites()`](#getEnabledCipherSuites())
  + ### getSupportedProtocols

    public abstract [String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] getSupportedProtocols()

    Returns the names of the protocols which could be enabled for use
    on an SSL connection.

    Returns:
    :   an array of protocols supported
  + ### getEnabledProtocols

    public abstract [String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] getEnabledProtocols()

    Returns the names of the protocol versions which are currently
    enabled for use on this connection.

    Note that even if a protocol is enabled, it may never be used.
    This can occur if the peer does not support the protocol, or its
    use is restricted, or there are no enabled cipher suites supported
    by the protocol.

    Returns:
    :   an array of protocols

    See Also:
    :   - [`setEnabledProtocols(String [])`](#setEnabledProtocols(java.lang.String%5B%5D))
  + ### setEnabledProtocols

    public abstract void setEnabledProtocols([String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] protocols)

    Sets the protocol versions enabled for use on this connection.

    The protocols must have been listed by
    `getSupportedProtocols()` as being supported.
    Following a successful call to this method, only protocols listed
    in the `protocols` parameter are enabled for use.

    Parameters:
    :   `protocols` - Names of all the protocols to enable.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - when one or more of
        the protocols named by the parameter is not supported or
        when the protocols parameter is null.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getEnabledProtocols()`](#getEnabledProtocols())
  + ### getSession

    public abstract [SSLSession](SSLSession.md "interface in javax.net.ssl") getSession()

    Returns the SSL Session in use by this connection. These can
    be long-lived, and frequently correspond to an entire login session
    for some user. The session specifies a particular cipher suite
    which is being actively used by all connections in that session,
    as well as the identities of the session's client and server.

    This method will initiate the initial handshake if
    necessary and then block until the handshake has been
    established.

    If an error occurs during the initial handshake, this method
    returns an invalid session object which reports an invalid
    cipher suite of "SSL\_NULL\_WITH\_NULL\_NULL".

    Returns:
    :   the `SSLSession`
  + ### getHandshakeSession

    public [SSLSession](SSLSession.md "interface in javax.net.ssl") getHandshakeSession()

    Returns the `SSLSession` being constructed during a SSL/TLS
    handshake.

    TLS protocols may negotiate parameters that are needed when using
    an instance of this class, but before the `SSLSession` has
    been completely initialized and made available via `getSession`.
    For example, the list of valid signature algorithms may restrict
    the type of certificates that can be used during TrustManager
    decisions, or the maximum TLS fragment packet sizes can be
    resized to better support the network environment.

    This method provides early access to the `SSLSession` being
    constructed. Depending on how far the handshake has progressed,
    some data may not yet be available for use. For example, if a
    remote server will be sending a Certificate chain, but that chain
    has yet not been processed, the `getPeerCertificates`
    method of `SSLSession` will throw a
    SSLPeerUnverifiedException. Once that chain has been processed,
    `getPeerCertificates` will return the proper value.

    Unlike [`getSession()`](#getSession()), this method does not initiate the
    initial handshake and does not block until handshaking is
    complete.

    Returns:
    :   null if this instance is not currently handshaking, or
        if the current handshake has not progressed far enough to
        create a basic SSLSession. Otherwise, this method returns the
        `SSLSession` currently being negotiated.

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the underlying provider
        does not implement the operation.

    public abstract void addHandshakeCompletedListener([HandshakeCompletedListener](HandshakeCompletedListener.md "interface in javax.net.ssl") listener)

    Registers an event listener to receive notifications that an
    SSL handshake has completed on this connection.

    Parameters:
    :   `listener` - the HandShake Completed event listener

    Throws:

    Removes a previously registered handshake completion listener.

    Parameters:

  + ### startHandshake

    public abstract void startHandshake()
    throws [IOException](../../../java/io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Starts an SSL handshake on this connection. Common reasons include
    a need to use new encryption keys, to change cipher suites, or to
    initiate a new session. To force complete reauthentication, the
    current session could be invalidated before starting this handshake.

    If data has already been sent on the connection, it continues
    to flow during this handshake. When the handshake completes, this
    will be signaled with an event.
    This method is synchronous for the initial handshake on a connection
    and returns when the negotiated handshake is complete. Some
    protocols may not support multiple handshakes on an existing socket
    and may throw an IOException.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - on a network level error

  + ### setUseClientMode

    public abstract void setUseClientMode(boolean mode)

    Configures the socket to use client (or server) mode when
    handshaking.

    This method must be called before any handshaking occurs.
    Once handshaking has begun, the mode can not be reset for the
    life of this socket.

    Servers normally authenticate themselves, and clients
    are not required to do so.

    Parameters:
    :   `mode` - true if the socket should start its handshaking
        in "client" mode

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if a mode change is attempted
        after the initial handshake has begun.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getUseClientMode()`](#getUseClientMode())
  + ### getUseClientMode

    public abstract boolean getUseClientMode()

    Returns true if the socket is set to use client mode when
    handshaking.

    Returns:
    :   true if the socket should do handshaking
        in "client" mode

    See Also:
    :   - [`setUseClientMode(boolean)`](#setUseClientMode(boolean))
  + ### setNeedClientAuth

    public abstract void setNeedClientAuth(boolean need)

    Configures the socket to *require* client authentication. This
    option is only useful for sockets in the server mode.

    A socket's client authentication setting is one of the following:
    - client authentication required- client authentication requested- no client authentication desired

    Unlike [`setWantClientAuth(boolean)`](#setWantClientAuth(boolean)), if this option is set and
    the client chooses not to provide authentication information
    about itself, *the negotiations will stop and the connection
    will be dropped*.

    Calling this method overrides any previous setting made by
    this method or [`setWantClientAuth(boolean)`](#setWantClientAuth(boolean)).

    Parameters:
    :   `need` - set to true if client authentication is required,
        or false if no client authentication is desired.

  + ### getNeedClientAuth

    public abstract boolean getNeedClientAuth()

    Returns true if the socket will *require* client authentication.
    This option is only useful to sockets in the server mode.

    Returns:
    :   true if client authentication is required,

  + ### setWantClientAuth

    public abstract void setWantClientAuth(boolean want)

    Configures the socket to *request* client authentication.
    This option is only useful for sockets in the server mode.

    A socket's client authentication setting is one of the following:
    - client authentication required- client authentication requested- no client authentication desired

    Unlike [`setNeedClientAuth(boolean)`](#setNeedClientAuth(boolean)), if this option is set and
    the client chooses not to provide authentication information
    about itself, *the negotiations will continue*.

    Calling this method overrides any previous setting made by
    this method or [`setNeedClientAuth(boolean)`](#setNeedClientAuth(boolean)).

    Parameters:
    :   `want` - set to true if client authentication is requested,
        or false if no client authentication is desired.

    public abstract boolean getWantClientAuth()

    Returns true if the socket will *request* client authentication.
    This option is only useful for sockets in the server mode.

    Returns:
    :   true if client authentication is requested,

        - [`setUseClientMode(boolean)`](#setUseClientMode(boolean))
  + ### setEnableSessionCreation

    public abstract void setEnableSessionCreation(boolean flag)

    Controls whether new SSL sessions may be established by this socket.
    If session creations are not allowed, and there are no
    existing sessions to resume, there will be no successful
    handshaking.

    Parameters:
    :   `flag` - true indicates that sessions may be created; this
        is the default. false indicates that an existing session
        must be resumed

    See Also:
    :   - [`getEnableSessionCreation()`](#getEnableSessionCreation())
  + ### getEnableSessionCreation

    public abstract boolean getEnableSessionCreation()

    Returns true if new SSL sessions may be established by this socket.

    Returns:
    :   true indicates that sessions may be created; this
        is the default. false indicates that an existing session
        must be resumed

    :   - [`setEnableSessionCreation(boolean)`](#setEnableSessionCreation(boolean))
  + ### getSSLParameters

    public [SSLParameters](SSLParameters.md "class in javax.net.ssl") getSSLParameters()

    Returns the SSLParameters in effect for this SSLSocket.
    The ciphersuites and protocols of the returned SSLParameters
    are always non-null.

    Returns:
    :   the SSLParameters in effect for this SSLSocket.

    Since:
    :   1.6
  + ### setSSLParameters

    public void setSSLParameters([SSLParameters](SSLParameters.md "class in javax.net.ssl") params)

    Applies SSLParameters to this socket.

    This means:
    - If `params.getCipherSuites()` is non-null,
      `setEnabledCipherSuites()` is called with that value.
    - If `params.getProtocols()` is non-null,
      `setEnabledProtocols()` is called with that value.
    - If `params.getNeedClientAuth()` or
      `params.getWantClientAuth()` return `true`,
      `setNeedClientAuth(true)` and
      `setWantClientAuth(true)` are called, respectively;
      otherwise `setWantClientAuth(false)` is called.
    - If `params.getServerNames()` is non-null, the socket will
      configure its server names with that value.
    - If `params.getSNIMatchers()` is non-null, the socket will
      configure its SNI matchers with that value.

    Parameters:
    :   `params` - the parameters

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the setEnabledCipherSuites() or
        the setEnabledProtocols() call fails

    Since:
    :   1.6
  + ### getApplicationProtocol

    public [String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getApplicationProtocol()

    Returns the most recent application protocol value negotiated for this
    connection.

    If supported by the underlying SSL/TLS/DTLS implementation,
    application name negotiation mechanisms such as  [RFC 7301](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7301.txt) , the
    Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN), can negotiate
    application-level values between peers.

    Returns:
    :   null if it has not yet been determined if application
        protocols might be used for this connection, an empty
        `String` if application protocols values will not
        be used, or a non-empty application protocol `String`
        if a value was successfully negotiated.

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the underlying provider
        does not implement the operation.

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### getHandshakeApplicationProtocol

    public [String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getHandshakeApplicationProtocol()

    Returns the application protocol value negotiated on a SSL/TLS
    handshake currently in progress.

    Like [`getHandshakeSession()`](#getHandshakeSession()),
    a connection may be in the middle of a handshake. The
    application protocol may or may not yet be available.

    Returns:
    :   null if it has not yet been determined if application
        protocols might be used for this handshake, an empty
        `String` if application protocols values will not
        be used, or a non-empty application protocol `String`
        if a value was successfully negotiated.

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the underlying provider
        does not implement the operation.

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector

    public void setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector([BiFunction](../../../java/util/function/BiFunction.md "interface in java.util.function")<[SSLSocket](SSLSocket.md "class in javax.net.ssl"),[List](../../../java/util/List.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")>,[String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> selector)

    Registers a callback function that selects an application protocol
    value for a SSL/TLS/DTLS handshake.
    The function overrides any values supplied using
    [`SSLParameters.setApplicationProtocols`](SSLParameters.md#setApplicationProtocols(java.lang.String%5B%5D)) and it supports the following
    type parameters:
    > `SSLSocket`: The function's first argument allows the current `SSLSocket` to be inspected, including the handshake session and configuration settings. `List<String>`: The function's second argument lists the application protocol names advertised by the TLS peer. `String`: The function's result is an application protocol name, or null to indicate that none of the advertised names are acceptable. If the return value is an empty `String` then application protocol indications will not be used. If the return value is null (no value chosen) or is a value that was not advertised by the peer, the underlying protocol will determine what action to take. (For example, ALPN will send a "no\_application\_protocol" alert and terminate the connection.)

    For example, the following call registers a callback function that
    examines the TLS handshake parameters and selects an application protocol
    name:

    ```
         serverSocket.setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector(
             (serverSocket, clientProtocols) -> {
                 SSLSession session = serverSocket.getHandshakeSession();
                 return chooseApplicationProtocol(
                     serverSocket,
                     clientProtocols,
                     session.getProtocol(),
                     session.getCipherSuite());
             });
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `selector` - the callback function, or null to de-register.

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the underlying provider
        does not implement the operation.

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### getHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector

    public [BiFunction](../../../java/util/function/BiFunction.md "interface in java.util.function")<[SSLSocket](SSLSocket.md "class in javax.net.ssl"),[List](../../../java/util/List.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")>,[String](../../../java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> getHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector()

    Retrieves the callback function that selects an application protocol
    value during a SSL/TLS/DTLS handshake.
    See [`setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector`](#setHandshakeApplicationProtocolSelector(java.util.function.BiFunction))
    for the function's type parameters.

    Returns:
    :   the callback function, or null if none has been set.

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the underlying provider
        does not implement the operation.

    Since:
