public abstract class Writer
extends [Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Appendable](../lang/Appendable.md "interface in java.lang"), [Closeable](Closeable.md "interface in java.io"), [Flushable](Flushable.md "interface in java.io")

Abstract class for writing to character streams. The only methods that a
subclass must implement are write(char[], int, int), flush(), and close().
Most subclasses, however, will override some of the methods defined here in
order to provide higher efficiency, additional functionality, or both.

* ## Field Details

  + ### lock

    protected [Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") lock

    The object used to synchronize operations on this stream. For
    efficiency, a character-stream object may use an object other than
    itself to protect critical sections. A subclass should therefore use
    the object in this field rather than `this` or a synchronized
    method.

    protected Writer()

    Creates a new character-stream writer whose critical sections will
    synchronize on the writer itself.
  + ### Writer

    protected Writer([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") lock)

    Creates a new character-stream writer whose critical sections will
    synchronize on the given object.

    Parameters:
    :   `lock` - Object to synchronize on
* ## Method Details

  + ### nullWriter

    public static [Writer](Writer.md "class in java.io") nullWriter()

    Returns a new `Writer` which discards all characters. The
    returned stream is initially open. The stream is closed by calling
    the `close()` method. Subsequent calls to `close()` have
    no effect.

    While the stream is open, the `append(char)`, `append(CharSequence)`, `append(CharSequence, int, int)`,
    `flush()`, `write(int)`, `write(char[])`, and
    `write(char[], int, int)` methods do nothing. After the stream
    has been closed, these methods all throw `IOException`.

    The [`object`](#lock) used to synchronize operations on the
    returned `Writer` is not specified.

    Returns:
    :   a `Writer` which discards all characters

    :   11
  + ### write

    public void write(int c)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Writes a single character. The character to be written is contained in
    the 16 low-order bits of the given integer value; the 16 high-order bits
    are ignored.

    Subclasses that intend to support efficient single-character output
    should override this method.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - int specifying a character to be written

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### write

    public void write(char[] cbuf)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Writes an array of characters.

    Parameters:
    :   `cbuf` - Array of characters to be written

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### write

    public abstract void write(char[] cbuf,
    int off,
    int len)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Writes a portion of an array of characters.

    Parameters:
    :   `cbuf` - Array of characters
    :   `off` - Offset from which to start writing characters
    :   `len` - Number of characters to write

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - Implementations should throw this exception
        if `off` is negative, or `len` is negative,
        or `off + len` is negative or greater than the length
        of the given array
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### write

    public void write([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") str)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Writes a string.

    Parameters:
    :   `str` - String to be written

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### write

    public void write([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") str,
    int off,
    int len)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Writes a portion of a string.

    Parameters:
    :   `str` - A String
    :   `off` - Offset from which to start writing characters
    :   `len` - Number of characters to write

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - Implementations should throw this exception
        if `off` is negative, or `len` is negative,
        or `off + len` is negative or greater than the length
        of the given string
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### append

    public [Writer](Writer.md "class in java.io") append([CharSequence](../lang/CharSequence.md "interface in java.lang") csq)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Appends the specified character sequence to this writer.

    An invocation of this method of the form `out.append(csq)`
    behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        out.write(csq.toString())
    ```

    Depending on the specification of `toString` for the
    character sequence `csq`, the entire sequence may not be
    appended. For instance, invoking the `toString` method of a
    character buffer will return a subsequence whose content depends upon
    the buffer's position and limit.

    Specified by:
    :   `append` in interface `Appendable`

    Parameters:
    :   `csq` - The character sequence to append. If `csq` is
        `null`, then the four characters `"null"` are
        appended to this writer.

    Returns:
    :   This writer

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs

    Since:
    :   1.5
  + ### append

    public [Writer](Writer.md "class in java.io") append([CharSequence](../lang/CharSequence.md "interface in java.lang") csq,
    int start,
    int end)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Appends a subsequence of the specified character sequence to this writer.
    `Appendable`.

    An invocation of this method of the form
    `out.append(csq, start, end)` when `csq`
    is not `null` behaves in exactly the
    same way as the invocation

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        out.write(csq.subSequence(start, end).toString())
    ```

    Specified by:
    :   `append` in interface `Appendable`

    Parameters:
    :   `csq` - The character sequence from which a subsequence will be
        appended. If `csq` is `null`, then characters
        will be appended as if `csq` contained the four
        characters `"null"`.
    :   `start` - The index of the first character in the subsequence
    :   `end` - The index of the character following the last character in the
        subsequence

    Returns:
    :   This writer

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If `start` or `end` are negative, `start`
        is greater than `end`, or `end` is greater than
        `csq.length()`
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs

    Since:
    :   1.5
  + ### append

    public [Writer](Writer.md "class in java.io") append(char c)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Appends the specified character to this writer.

    An invocation of this method of the form `out.append(c)`
    behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        out.write(c)
    ```

    Specified by:
    :   `append` in interface `Appendable`

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - The 16-bit character to append

    Returns:
    :   This writer

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs

    Since:
    :   1.5
  + ### flush

    public abstract void flush()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Flushes the stream. If the stream has saved any characters from the
    various write() methods in a buffer, write them immediately to their
    intended destination. Then, if that destination is another character or
    byte stream, flush it. Thus one flush() invocation will flush all the
    buffers in a chain of Writers and OutputStreams.

    If the intended destination of this stream is an abstraction provided
    by the underlying operating system, for example a file, then flushing the
    stream guarantees only that bytes previously written to the stream are
    passed to the operating system for writing; it does not guarantee that
    they are actually written to a physical device such as a disk drive.

    Specified by:
    :   `flush` in interface `Flushable`

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### close

    public abstract void close()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Closes the stream, flushing it first. Once the stream has been closed,
    further write() or flush() invocations will cause an IOException to be
    thrown. Closing a previously closed stream has no effect.

    Specified by:
    :   `close` in interface `AutoCloseable`

    Specified by:
    :   `close` in interface `Closeable`

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
