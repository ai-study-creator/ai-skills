public class BufferedReader
extends [Reader](Reader.md "class in java.io")

Reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to
provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.

The buffer size may be specified, or the default size may be used. The
default is large enough for most purposes.

In general, each read request made of a Reader causes a corresponding
read request to be made of the underlying character or byte stream. It is
therefore advisable to wrap a BufferedReader around any Reader whose read()
operations may be costly, such as FileReaders and InputStreamReaders. For
example,

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

```
    BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("foo.in"));
```

will buffer the input from the specified file. Without buffering, each
invocation of read() or readLine() could cause bytes to be read from the
file, converted into characters, and then returned, which can be very
inefficient.

Programs that use DataInputStreams for textual input can be localized by
replacing each DataInputStream with an appropriate BufferedReader.

* ## Method Details

  + ### read

    public int read()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads a single character.

    Overrides:
    :   `read` in class `Reader`

    Returns:
    :   The character read, as an integer in the range
        0 to 65535 (`0x00-0xffff`), or -1 if the
        end of the stream has been reached

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### read

    public int read(char[] cbuf,
    int off,
    int len)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads characters into a portion of an array.

    This method implements the general contract of the corresponding
    [`read`](Reader.md#read(char%5B%5D,int,int)) method of the
    [`Reader`](Reader.md "class in java.io") class. As an additional convenience, it
    attempts to read as many characters as possible by repeatedly invoking
    the `read` method of the underlying stream. This iterated
    `read` continues until one of the following conditions becomes
    true:
    - The specified number of characters have been read,- The `read` method of the underlying stream returns
        `-1`, indicating end-of-file, or- The `ready` method of the underlying stream
          returns `false`, indicating that further input requests
          would block.If the first `read` on the underlying stream returns
    `-1` to indicate end-of-file then this method returns
    `-1`. Otherwise this method returns the number of characters
    actually read.

    Subclasses of this class are encouraged, but not required, to
    attempt to read as many characters as possible in the same fashion.

    Ordinarily this method takes characters from this stream's character
    buffer, filling it from the underlying stream as necessary. If,
    however, the buffer is empty, the mark is not valid, and the requested
    length is at least as large as the buffer, then this method will read
    characters directly from the underlying stream into the given array.
    Thus redundant `BufferedReader`s will not copy data
    unnecessarily.

    Specified by:
    :   `read` in class `Reader`

    Parameters:
    :   `cbuf` - Destination buffer
    :   `off` - Offset at which to start storing characters
    :   `len` - Maximum number of characters to read

    Returns:
    :   The number of characters read, or -1 if the end of the
        stream has been reached

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If `off` is negative, or `len` is negative,
        or `len` is greater than `cbuf.length - off`
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### readLine

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") readLine()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads a line of text. A line is considered to be terminated by any one
    of a line feed ('\n'), a carriage return ('\r'), a carriage return
    followed immediately by a line feed, or by reaching the end-of-file
    (EOF).

    Returns:
    :   A String containing the contents of the line, not including
        any line-termination characters, or null if the end of the
        stream has been reached without reading any characters

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs

    See Also:
    :   - [`Files.readAllLines(java.nio.file.Path, java.nio.charset.Charset)`](../nio/file/Files.md#readAllLines(java.nio.file.Path,java.nio.charset.Charset))
  + ### skip

    public long skip(long n)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Skips characters. This method will block until some characters are
    available, an I/O error occurs, or the end of the stream is reached.
    If the stream is already at its end before this method is invoked,
    then no characters are skipped and zero is returned.

    Overrides:
    :   `skip` in class `Reader`

    Parameters:
    :   `n` - The number of characters to skip

    Returns:
    :   The number of characters actually skipped

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### ready

    public boolean ready()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Tells whether this stream is ready to be read. A buffered character
    stream is ready if the buffer is not empty, or if the underlying
    character stream is ready.

    Overrides:
    :   `ready` in class `Reader`

    Returns:
    :   True if the next read() is guaranteed not to block for input,
        false otherwise. Note that returning false does not guarantee that the
        next read will block.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### markSupported

    public boolean markSupported()

    Tells whether this stream supports the mark() operation, which it does.

    Overrides:
    :   `markSupported` in class `Reader`

    Returns:
    :   true if and only if this stream supports the mark operation.
  + ### mark

    public void mark(int readAheadLimit)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Marks the present position in the stream. Subsequent calls to reset()
    will attempt to reposition the stream to this point.

    Overrides:
    :   `mark` in class `Reader`

    Parameters:
    :   `readAheadLimit` - Limit on the number of characters that may be
        read while still preserving the mark. An attempt
        to reset the stream after reading characters
        up to this limit or beyond may fail.
        A limit value larger than the size of the input
        buffer will cause a new buffer to be allocated
        whose size is no smaller than limit.
        Therefore large values should be used with care.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - If `readAheadLimit < 0`
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### reset

    public void reset()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Resets the stream to the most recent mark.

    Overrides:
    :   `reset` in class `Reader`

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If the stream has never been marked,
        or if the mark has been invalidated
  + ### close

    public void close()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Description copied from class: `Reader`

    Closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with
    it. Once the stream has been closed, further read(), ready(),
    mark(), reset(), or skip() invocations will throw an IOException.
    Closing a previously closed stream has no effect.

    Specified by:
    :   `close` in interface `AutoCloseable`

    Specified by:
    :   `close` in interface `Closeable`

    Specified by:
    :   `close` in class `Reader`

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### lines

    public [Stream](../util/stream/Stream.md "interface in java.util.stream")<[String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> lines()

    Returns a `Stream`, the elements of which are lines read from
    this `BufferedReader`. The [`Stream`](../util/stream/Stream.md "interface in java.util.stream") is lazily populated,
    i.e., read only occurs during the
    [terminal
    stream operation](../util/stream/package-summary.md#StreamOps).

    The reader must not be operated on during the execution of the
    terminal stream operation. Otherwise, the result of the terminal stream
    operation is undefined.

    After execution of the terminal stream operation there are no
    guarantees that the reader will be at a specific position from which to
    read the next character or line.

    If an [`IOException`](IOException.md "class in java.io") is thrown when accessing the underlying
    `BufferedReader`, it is wrapped in an [`UncheckedIOException`](UncheckedIOException.md "class in java.io") which will be thrown from the `Stream`
    method that caused the read to take place. This method will return a
    Stream if invoked on a BufferedReader that is closed. Any operation on
    that stream that requires reading from the BufferedReader after it is
    closed, will cause an UncheckedIOException to be thrown.

    Returns:
    :   a `Stream<String>` providing the lines of text
        described by this `BufferedReader`
