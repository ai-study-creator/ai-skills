# Class RandomAccessFile

[java.lang.Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

java.io.RandomAccessFile

All Implemented Interfaces:
:   `Closeable`, `DataInput`, `DataOutput`, `AutoCloseable`

---

public class RandomAccessFile
extends [Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [DataOutput](DataOutput.md "interface in java.io"), [DataInput](DataInput.md "interface in java.io"), [Closeable](Closeable.md "interface in java.io")

Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a
random access file. A random access file behaves like a large
array of bytes stored in the file system. There is a kind of cursor,
or index into the implied array, called the *file pointer*;
input operations read bytes starting at the file pointer and advance
the file pointer past the bytes read. If the random access file is
created in read/write mode, then output operations are also available;
output operations write bytes starting at the file pointer and advance
the file pointer past the bytes written. Output operations that write
past the current end of the implied array cause the array to be
extended. The file pointer can be read by the
`getFilePointer` method and set by the `seek`
method.

It is generally true of all the reading routines in this class that
if end-of-file is reached before the desired number of bytes has been
read, an `EOFException` (which is a kind of
`IOException`) is thrown. If any byte cannot be read for
any reason other than end-of-file, an `IOException` other
than `EOFException` is thrown. In particular, an
`IOException` may be thrown if the stream has been closed.

  + ### RandomAccessFile

    public RandomAccessFile([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name,
    [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") mode)
    throws [FileNotFoundException](FileNotFoundException.md "class in java.io")

    Creates a random access file stream to read from, and optionally
    to write to, a file with the specified name. A new
    [`FileDescriptor`](FileDescriptor.md "class in java.io") object is created to represent the
    connection to the file.

    The `mode` argument specifies the access mode with which the
    file is to be opened. The permitted values and their meanings are as
    specified for the [`RandomAccessFile(File,String)`](#mode) constructor.

    If there is a security manager, its `checkRead` method
    is called with the `name` argument
    as its argument to see if read access to the file is allowed.
    If the mode allows writing, the security manager's
    `checkWrite` method
    is also called with the `name` argument
    as its argument to see if write access to the file is allowed.

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - the system-dependent filename
    :   `mode` - the access [mode](#mode)

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the mode argument is not equal
        to one of `"r"`, `"rw"`, `"rws"`, or
        `"rwd"`
    :   `FileNotFoundException` - if the mode is `"r"` but the given string does not
        denote an existing regular file, or if the mode begins with
        `"rw"` but the given string does not denote an
        existing, writable regular file and a new regular file of
        that name cannot be created, or if some other error occurs
        while opening or creating the file
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its
        `checkRead` method denies read access to the file
        or the mode is `"rw"` and the security manager's
        `checkWrite` method denies write access to the file

    See Also:
    :   - [`SecurityException`](../lang/SecurityException.md "class in java.lang")
        - [`SecurityManager.checkRead(java.lang.String)`](../lang/SecurityManager.md#checkRead(java.lang.String))
        - [`SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)`](../lang/SecurityManager.md#checkWrite(java.lang.String))
  + ### RandomAccessFile

    public RandomAccessFile([File](File.md "class in java.io") file,
    [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") mode)
    throws [FileNotFoundException](FileNotFoundException.md "class in java.io")

    Creates a random access file stream to read from, and optionally to
    write to, the file specified by the [`File`](File.md "class in java.io") argument. A new [`FileDescriptor`](FileDescriptor.md "class in java.io") object is created to represent this file connection.

    The `mode` argument specifies the access mode
    in which the file is to be opened. The permitted values and their
    meanings are:

    Access mode permitted values and meanings

    | Value | Meaning |
    | --- | --- |
    | `"r"` | Open for reading only. Invoking any of the `write` methods of the resulting object will cause an [`IOException`](IOException.md "class in java.io") to be thrown. |
    | `"rw"` | Open for reading and writing. If the file does not already exist then an attempt will be made to create it. |
    | `"rws"` | Open for reading and writing, as with `"rw"`, and also require that every update to the file's content or metadata be written synchronously to the underlying storage device. |
    | `"rwd"` | Open for reading and writing, as with `"rw"`, and also require that every update to the file's content be written synchronously to the underlying storage device. |

    The `"rws"` and `"rwd"` modes work much like the [`force(boolean)`](../nio/channels/FileChannel.md#force(boolean)) method of
    the [`FileChannel`](../nio/channels/FileChannel.md "class in java.nio.channels") class, passing arguments of
    `true` and `false`, respectively, except that they always
    apply to every I/O operation and are therefore often more efficient. If
    the file resides on a local storage device then when an invocation of a
    method of this class returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to
    the file by that invocation will have been written to that device. This
    is useful for ensuring that critical information is not lost in the
    event of a system crash. If the file does not reside on a local device
    then no such guarantee is made.

    The `"rwd"` mode can be used to reduce the number of I/O
    operations performed. Using `"rwd"` only requires updates to the
    file's content to be written to storage; using `"rws"` requires
    updates to both the file's content and its metadata to be written, which
    generally requires at least one more low-level I/O operation.

    If there is a security manager, its `checkRead` method is
    called with the pathname of the `file` argument as its
    argument to see if read access to the file is allowed. If the mode
    allows writing, the security manager's `checkWrite` method is
    also called with the path argument to see if write access to the file is
    allowed.

    Parameters:
    :   `file` - the file object
    :   `mode` - the access mode, as described
        [above](#mode)

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the mode argument is not equal
        to one of `"r"`, `"rw"`, `"rws"`, or
        `"rwd"`
    :   `FileNotFoundException` - if the mode is `"r"` but the given file object does
        not denote an existing regular file, or if the mode begins
        with `"rw"` but the given file object does not denote
        an existing, writable regular file and a new regular file of
        that name cannot be created, or if some other error occurs
        while opening or creating the file
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its
        `checkRead` method denies read access to the file
        or the mode is `"rw"` and the security manager's
        `checkWrite` method denies write access to the file

  + ### getFD

    public final [FileDescriptor](FileDescriptor.md "class in java.io") getFD()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Returns the opaque file descriptor object associated with this
    stream.

    Returns:
    :   the file descriptor object associated with this stream.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.

    See Also:
    :   - [`FileDescriptor`](FileDescriptor.md "class in java.io")
  + ### getChannel

    public final [FileChannel](../nio/channels/FileChannel.md "class in java.nio.channels") getChannel()

    Returns the unique [`FileChannel`](../nio/channels/FileChannel.md "class in java.nio.channels")
    object associated with this file.

    The [`position`](../nio/channels/FileChannel.md#position()) of the returned channel will always be equal to
    this object's file-pointer offset as returned by the [`getFilePointer`](#getFilePointer()) method. Changing this object's
    file-pointer offset, whether explicitly or by reading or writing bytes,
    will change the position of the channel, and vice versa. Changing the
    file's length via this object will change the length seen via the file
    channel, and vice versa.

    Returns:
    :   the file channel associated with this file

    Since:
    :   1.4
  + ### read

    public int read()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads a byte of data from this file. The byte is returned as an
    integer in the range 0 to 255 (`0x00-0x0ff`). This
    method blocks if no input is yet available.

    Although `RandomAccessFile` is not a subclass of
    `InputStream`, this method behaves in exactly the same
    way as the [`InputStream.read()`](InputStream.md#read()) method of
    `InputStream`.

    Returns:
    :   the next byte of data, or `-1` if the end of the
        file has been reached.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs. Not thrown if
        end-of-file has been reached.
  + ### read

    public int read(byte[] b,
    int off,
    int len)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads up to `len` bytes of data from this file into an
    array of bytes. This method blocks until at least one byte of input
    is available.

    Although `RandomAccessFile` is not a subclass of
    `InputStream`, this method behaves in exactly the
    same way as the [`InputStream.read(byte[], int, int)`](InputStream.md#read(byte%5B%5D,int,int)) method of
    `InputStream`.

    Parameters:
    :   `b` - the buffer into which the data is read.
    :   `off` - the start offset in array `b`
        at which the data is written.
    :   `len` - the maximum number of bytes read.

    Returns:
    :   the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or
        `-1` if there is no more data because the end of
        the file has been reached.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If the first byte cannot be read for any reason
        other than end of file, or if the random access file has been closed,
        or if some other I/O error occurs.
    :   `NullPointerException` - If `b` is `null`.
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If `off` is negative,
        `len` is negative, or `len` is greater than
        `b.length - off`
  + ### read

    public int read(byte[] b)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads up to `b.length` bytes of data from this file
    into an array of bytes. This method blocks until at least one byte
    of input is available.

    Although `RandomAccessFile` is not a subclass of
    `InputStream`, this method behaves in exactly the
    same way as the [`InputStream.read(byte[])`](InputStream.md#read(byte%5B%5D)) method of
    `InputStream`.

    Parameters:
    :   `b` - the buffer into which the data is read.

    Returns:
    :   the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or
        `-1` if there is no more data because the end of
        this file has been reached.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If the first byte cannot be read for any reason
        other than end of file, or if the random access file has been closed,
        or if some other I/O error occurs.
    :   `NullPointerException` - If `b` is `null`.
  + ### readFully

    public final void readFully(byte[] b)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads `b.length` bytes from this file into the byte
    array, starting at the current file pointer. This method reads
    repeatedly from the file until the requested number of bytes are
    read. This method blocks until the requested number of bytes are
    read, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.

    Specified by:
    :   `readFully` in interface `DataInput`

    Parameters:
    :   `b` - the buffer into which the data is read.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `b` is `null`.
    :   `EOFException` - if this file reaches the end before reading
        all the bytes.
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### readFully

    public final void readFully(byte[] b,
    int off,
    int len)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads exactly `len` bytes from this file into the byte
    array, starting at the current file pointer. This method reads
    repeatedly from the file until the requested number of bytes are
    read. This method blocks until the requested number of bytes are
    read, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.

    Specified by:
    :   `readFully` in interface `DataInput`

    Parameters:
    :   `b` - the buffer into which the data is read.
    :   `off` - the start offset into the data array `b`.
    :   `len` - the number of bytes to read.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `b` is `null`.
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if `off` is negative,
        `len` is negative, or `len` is greater than
        `b.length - off`.
    :   `EOFException` - if this file reaches the end before reading
        all the bytes.
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### skipBytes

    public int skipBytes(int n)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Attempts to skip over `n` bytes of input discarding the
    skipped bytes.

    This method may skip over some smaller number of bytes, possibly zero.
    This may result from any of a number of conditions; reaching end of
    file before `n` bytes have been skipped is only one
    possibility. This method never throws an `EOFException`.
    The actual number of bytes skipped is returned. If `n`
    is negative, no bytes are skipped.

    Specified by:
    :   `skipBytes` in interface `DataInput`

    Parameters:
    :   `n` - the number of bytes to be skipped.

    Returns:
    :   the actual number of bytes skipped.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### write

    public void write(int b)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Writes the specified byte to this file. The write starts at
    the current file pointer.

    Specified by:
    :   `write` in interface `DataOutput`

    Parameters:

    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Writes `b.length` bytes from the specified byte array
    to this file, starting at the current file pointer.

    Specified by:
    :   `write` in interface `DataOutput`

    Parameters:
    :   `b` - the data.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### write

    public void write(byte[] b,
    int off,
    int len)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Writes `len` bytes from the specified byte array
    starting at offset `off` to this file.

    Specified by:
    :   `write` in interface `DataOutput`

    Parameters:
    :   `b` - the data.
    :   `off` - the start offset in the data.
    :   `len` - the number of bytes to write.

    Throws:

    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If `off` is negative,
        `len` is negative, or `len` is greater than
        `b.length - off`
  + ### getFilePointer

    public long getFilePointer()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Returns the current offset in this file.

    Returns:
    :   the offset from the beginning of the file, in bytes,
        at which the next read or write occurs.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### seek

    public void seek(long pos)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Sets the file-pointer offset, measured from the beginning of this
    file, at which the next read or write occurs. The offset may be
    set beyond the end of the file. Setting the offset beyond the end
    of the file does not change the file length. The file length will
    change only by writing after the offset has been set beyond the end
    of the file.

    Parameters:
    :   `pos` - the offset position, measured in bytes from the
        beginning of the file, at which to set the file
        pointer.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if `pos` is less than
        `0` or if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### length

    public long length()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Returns the length of this file.

    Returns:
    :   the length of this file, measured in bytes.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### setLength

    public void setLength(long newLength)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Sets the length of this file.

    If the present length of the file as returned by the
    `length` method is greater than the `newLength`
    argument then the file will be truncated. In this case, if the file
    offset as returned by the `getFilePointer` method is greater
    than `newLength` then after this method returns the offset
    will be equal to `newLength`.

    If the present length of the file as returned by the
    `length` method is smaller than the `newLength`
    argument then the file will be extended. In this case, the contents of
    the extended portion of the file are not defined.

    Parameters:
    :   `newLength` - The desired length of the file

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs

    Since:
    :   1.2
  + ### close

    public void close()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Closes this random access file stream and releases any system
    resources associated with the stream. A closed random access
    file cannot perform input or output operations and cannot be
    reopened.

    If this file has an associated channel then the channel is closed
    as well.

    Specified by:
    :   `close` in interface `AutoCloseable`

  + ### readLine

    public final [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") readLine()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads the next line of text from this file. This method successively
    reads bytes from the file, starting at the current file pointer,
    until it reaches a line terminator or the end
    of the file. Each byte is converted into a character by taking the
    byte's value for the lower eight bits of the character and setting the
    high eight bits of the character to zero. This method does not,
    therefore, support the full Unicode character set.

    A line of text is terminated by a carriage-return character
    (`'\r'`), a newline character (`'\n'`), a
    carriage-return character immediately followed by a newline character,
    or the end of the file. Line-terminating characters are discarded and
    are not included as part of the string returned.

    This method blocks until a newline character is read, a carriage
    return and the byte following it are read (to see if it is a newline),
    the end of the file is reached, or an exception is thrown.

    Specified by:
    :   `readLine` in interface `DataInput`

    Returns:
    :   the next line of text from this file, or null if end
        of file is encountered before even one byte is read.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
  + ### readUTF

    public final [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") readUTF()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads in a string from this file. The string has been encoded
    using a
    [modified UTF-8](DataInput.md#modified-utf-8)
    format.

    The first two bytes are read, starting from the current file
    pointer, as if by
    `readUnsignedShort`. This value gives the number of
    following bytes that are in the encoded string, not
    the length of the resulting string. The following bytes are then
    interpreted as bytes encoding characters in the modified UTF-8 format
    and are converted into characters.

    This method blocks until all the bytes are read, the end of the
    stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.

    Specified by:
    :   `readUTF` in interface `DataInput`

    Returns:
    :   a Unicode string.

    Throws:
    :   `EOFException` - if this file reaches the end before
        reading all the bytes.
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.
    :   `UTFDataFormatException` - if the bytes do not represent
        valid modified UTF-8 encoding of a Unicode string.
