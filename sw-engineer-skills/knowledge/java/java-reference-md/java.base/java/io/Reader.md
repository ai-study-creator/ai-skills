public abstract class Reader
extends [Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Readable](../lang/Readable.md "interface in java.lang"), [Closeable](Closeable.md "interface in java.io")

Abstract class for reading character streams. The only methods that a
subclass must implement are read(char[], int, int) and close(). Most
subclasses, however, will override some of the methods defined here in order
to provide higher efficiency, additional functionality, or both.

* ## Field Details

  + ### lock

    protected [Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") lock

    The object used to synchronize operations on this stream. For
    efficiency, a character-stream object may use an object other than
    itself to protect critical sections. A subclass should therefore use
    the object in this field rather than `this` or a synchronized
    method.

  + ### Reader

    protected Reader()

    Creates a new character-stream reader whose critical sections will
    synchronize on the reader itself.
  + ### Reader

    protected Reader([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") lock)

    Creates a new character-stream reader whose critical sections will
    synchronize on the given object.

    Parameters:
    :   `lock` - The Object to synchronize on.
* ## Method Details

  + ### nullReader

    public static [Reader](Reader.md "class in java.io") nullReader()

    Returns a new `Reader` that reads no characters. The returned
    stream is initially open. The stream is closed by calling the
    `close()` method. Subsequent calls to `close()` have no
    effect.

    While the stream is open, the `read()`, `read(char[])`,
    `read(char[], int, int)`, `read(CharBuffer)`, `ready()`, `skip(long)`, and `transferTo()` methods all
    behave as if end of stream has been reached. After the stream has been
    closed, these methods all throw `IOException`.

    The `markSupported()` method returns `false`. The
    `mark()` and `reset()` methods throw an `IOException`.

    The [`object`](#lock) used to synchronize operations on the
    returned `Reader` is not specified.

    Returns:
    :   a `Reader` which reads no characters

    Since:
    :   11
  + ### read

    public int read([CharBuffer](../nio/CharBuffer.md "class in java.nio") target)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Attempts to read characters into the specified character buffer.
    The buffer is used as a repository of characters as-is: the only
    changes made are the results of a put operation. No flipping or
    rewinding of the buffer is performed.

    Specified by:
    :   `read` in interface `Readable`

    Parameters:
    :   `target` - the buffer to read characters into

    Returns:
    :   The number of characters added to the buffer, or
        -1 if this source of characters is at its end

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs
    :   `NullPointerException` - if target is null
    :   `ReadOnlyBufferException` - if target is a read only buffer

    Since:
    :   1.5
  + ### read

    public int read()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads a single character. This method will block until a character is
    available, an I/O error occurs, or the end of the stream is reached.

    Subclasses that intend to support efficient single-character input
    should override this method.

    Returns:
    :   The character read, as an integer in the range 0 to 65535
        (`0x00-0xffff`), or -1 if the end of the stream has
        been reached

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### read

    public int read(char[] cbuf)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads characters into an array. This method will block until some input
    is available, an I/O error occurs, or the end of the stream is reached.

    If the length of `cbuf` is zero, then no characters are read
    and `0` is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at
    least one character. If no character is available because the stream is
    at its end, the value `-1` is returned; otherwise, at least one
    character is read and stored into `cbuf`.

    Parameters:
    :   `cbuf` - Destination buffer

    Returns:
    :   The number of characters read, or -1
        if the end of the stream
        has been reached

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### read

    public abstract int read(char[] cbuf,
    int off,
    int len)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads characters into a portion of an array. This method will block
    until some input is available, an I/O error occurs, or the end of the
    stream is reached.

    If `len` is zero, then no characters are read and `0` is
    returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at least one character.
    If no character is available because the stream is at its end, the value
    `-1` is returned; otherwise, at least one character is read and
    stored into `cbuf`.

    Parameters:
    :   `cbuf` - Destination buffer
    :   `off` - Offset at which to start storing characters
    :   `len` - Maximum number of characters to read

    Returns:
    :   The number of characters read, or -1 if the end of the
        stream has been reached

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If `off` is negative, or `len` is negative,
        or `len` is greater than `cbuf.length - off`
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### skip

    public long skip(long n)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Skips characters. This method will block until some characters are
    available, an I/O error occurs, or the end of the stream is reached.
    If the stream is already at its end before this method is invoked,
    then no characters are skipped and zero is returned.

    Parameters:
    :   `n` - The number of characters to skip

    Returns:
    :   The number of characters actually skipped

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - If `n` is negative.
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### ready

    public boolean ready()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Tells whether this stream is ready to be read.

    Returns:
    :   True if the next read() is guaranteed not to block for input,
        false otherwise. Note that returning false does not guarantee that the
        next read will block.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### markSupported

    public boolean markSupported()

    Tells whether this stream supports the mark() operation. The default
    implementation always returns false. Subclasses should override this
    method.

    Returns:
    :   true if and only if this stream supports the mark operation.
  + ### mark

    public void mark(int readAheadLimit)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Marks the present position in the stream. Subsequent calls to reset()
    will attempt to reposition the stream to this point. Not all
    character-input streams support the mark() operation.

    Parameters:
    :   `readAheadLimit` - Limit on the number of characters that may be
        read while still preserving the mark. After
        reading this many characters, attempting to
        reset the stream may fail.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If the stream does not support mark(),
        or if some other I/O error occurs
  + ### reset

    public void reset()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Resets the stream. If the stream has been marked, then attempt to
    reposition it at the mark. If the stream has not been marked, then
    attempt to reset it in some way appropriate to the particular stream,
    for example by repositioning it to its starting point. Not all
    character-input streams support the reset() operation, and some support
    reset() without supporting mark().

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If the stream has not been marked,
        or if the mark has been invalidated,
        or if the stream does not support reset(),
        or if some other I/O error occurs
  + ### close

    public abstract void close()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with
    it. Once the stream has been closed, further read(), ready(),
    mark(), reset(), or skip() invocations will throw an IOException.
    Closing a previously closed stream has no effect.

    Specified by:
    :   `close` in interface `AutoCloseable`

    Specified by:
    :   `close` in interface `Closeable`

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### transferTo

    public long transferTo([Writer](Writer.md "class in java.io") out)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads all characters from this reader and writes the characters to the
    given writer in the order that they are read. On return, this reader
    will be at end of the stream. This method does not close either reader
    or writer.

    This method may block indefinitely reading from the reader, or
    writing to the writer. The behavior for the case where the reader
    and/or writer is *asynchronously closed*, or the thread
    interrupted during the transfer, is highly reader and writer
    specific, and therefore not specified.

    If the total number of characters transferred is greater than [Long.MAX\_VALUE](../lang/Long.md#MAX_VALUE), then `Long.MAX_VALUE` will be returned.

    If an I/O error occurs reading from the reader or writing to the
    writer, then it may do so after some characters have been read or
    written. Consequently the reader may not be at end of the stream and
    one, or both, streams may be in an inconsistent state. It is strongly
    recommended that both streams be promptly closed if an I/O error occurs.

    Parameters:
    :   `out` - the writer, non-null

    Returns:
    :   the number of characters transferred

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs when reading or writing
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `out` is `null`
