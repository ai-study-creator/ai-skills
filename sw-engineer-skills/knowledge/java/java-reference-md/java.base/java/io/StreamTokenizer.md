# Class StreamTokenizer

[java.lang.Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

java.io.StreamTokenizer

---

public class StreamTokenizer
extends [Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

The `StreamTokenizer` class takes an input stream and
parses it into "tokens", allowing the tokens to be
read one at a time. The parsing process is controlled by a table
and a number of flags that can be set to various states. The
stream tokenizer can recognize identifiers, numbers, quoted
strings, and various comment styles.

Each byte read from the input stream is regarded as a character
in the range `'\u0000'` through `'\u00FF'`.
The character value is used to look up five possible attributes of
the character: *white space*, *alphabetic*,
*numeric*, *string quote*, and *comment character*.
Each character can have zero or more of these attributes.

In addition, an instance has four flags. These flags indicate:

* Whether line terminators are to be returned as tokens or treated
  as white space that merely separates tokens.* Whether C-style comments are to be recognized and skipped.* Whether C++-style comments are to be recognized and skipped.* Whether the characters of identifiers are converted to lowercase.

A typical application first constructs an instance of this class,
sets up the syntax tables, and then repeatedly loops calling the
`nextToken` method in each iteration of the loop until
it returns the value `TT_EOF`.

Since:

  + ### ttype

    public int ttype

    After a call to the `nextToken` method, this field
    contains the type of the token just read. For a single character
    token, its value is the single character, converted to an integer.
    For a quoted string token, its value is the quote character.
    Otherwise, its value is one of the following:
    - `TT_WORD` indicates that the token is a word.- `TT_NUMBER` indicates that the token is a number.- `TT_EOL` indicates that the end of line has been read.
          The field can only have this value if the
          `eolIsSignificant` method has been called with the
          argument `true`.- `TT_EOF` indicates that the end of the input stream
            has been reached.

  + ### StreamTokenizer

    [@Deprecated](../lang/Deprecated.md "annotation interface in java.lang")
    public StreamTokenizer([InputStream](InputStream.md "class in java.io") is)

    Deprecated.

    As of JDK version 1.1, the preferred way to tokenize an
    input stream is to convert it into a character stream, for example:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        Reader r = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));
        StreamTokenizer st = new StreamTokenizer(r);
    ```

    Creates a stream tokenizer that parses the specified input
    stream. The stream tokenizer is initialized to the following
    default state:
    - All byte values `'A'` through `'Z'`,
      `'a'` through `'z'`, and
      `'\u00A0'` through `'\u00FF'` are
      considered to be alphabetic.- All byte values `'\u0000'` through
        `'\u0020'` are considered to be white space.- `'/'` is a comment character.- Single quote `'\''` and double quote `'"'`
            are string quote characters.- Numbers are parsed.- Ends of lines are treated as white space, not as separate tokens.- C-style and C++-style comments are not recognized.

    Parameters:
    :   `is` - an input stream.

  + ### StreamTokenizer

    public StreamTokenizer([Reader](Reader.md "class in java.io") r)

    Create a tokenizer that parses the given character stream.

    Parameters:
    :   `r` - a Reader object providing the input stream.

    Since:
    :   1.1
* ## Method Details

  + ### resetSyntax

    public void resetSyntax()

    Resets this tokenizer's syntax table so that all characters are
    "ordinary." See the `ordinaryChar` method
    for more information on a character being ordinary.

    See Also:
    :   - [`ordinaryChar(int)`](#ordinaryChar(int))
  + ### wordChars

    public void wordChars(int low,
    int hi)

    Specifies that all characters *c* in the range
    `low <= c <= high`
    are word constituents. A word token consists of a word constituent
    followed by zero or more word constituents or number constituents.

    Parameters:
    :   `low` - the low end of the range.
    :   `hi` - the high end of the range.
  + ### whitespaceChars

    public void whitespaceChars(int low,
    int hi)

    Specifies that all characters *c* in the range
    `low <= c <= high`
    are white space characters. White space characters serve only to
    separate tokens in the input stream.

    Any other attribute settings for the characters in the specified
    range are cleared.

    Parameters:
    :   `low` - the low end of the range.
    :   `hi` - the high end of the range.
  + ### ordinaryChars

    public void ordinaryChars(int low,
    int hi)

    Specifies that all characters *c* in the range
    `low <= c <= high`
    are "ordinary" in this tokenizer. See the
    `ordinaryChar` method for more information on a
    character being ordinary.

    Parameters:
    :   `low` - the low end of the range.
    :   `hi` - the high end of the range.

    See Also:
    :   - [`ordinaryChar(int)`](#ordinaryChar(int))
  + ### ordinaryChar

    public void ordinaryChar(int ch)

    Specifies that the character argument is "ordinary"
    in this tokenizer. It removes any special significance the
    character has as a comment character, word component, string
    delimiter, white space, or number character. When such a character
    is encountered by the parser, the parser treats it as a
    single-character token and sets `ttype` field to the
    character value.

    Making a line terminator character "ordinary" may interfere
    with the ability of a `StreamTokenizer` to count
    lines. The `lineno` method may no longer reflect
    the presence of such terminator characters in its line count.

    Parameters:
    :   `ch` - the character.

    See Also:
    :   - [`ttype`](#ttype)
  + ### commentChar

    public void commentChar(int ch)

    Specified that the character argument starts a single-line
    comment. All characters from the comment character to the end of
    the line are ignored by this stream tokenizer.

    Any other attribute settings for the specified character are cleared.

    Parameters:
    :   `ch` - the character.
  + ### quoteChar

    public void quoteChar(int ch)

    Specifies that matching pairs of this character delimit string
    constants in this tokenizer.

    When the `nextToken` method encounters a string
    constant, the `ttype` field is set to the string
    delimiter and the `sval` field is set to the body of
    the string.

    If a string quote character is encountered, then a string is
    recognized, consisting of all characters after (but not including)
    the string quote character, up to (but not including) the next
    occurrence of that same string quote character, or a line
    terminator, or end of file. The usual escape sequences such as
    `"\n"` and `"\t"` are recognized and
    converted to single characters as the string is parsed.

    Any other attribute settings for the specified character are cleared.

    Parameters:
    :   `ch` - the character.

    See Also:
    :   - [`nextToken()`](#nextToken())
        - [`sval`](#sval)
        - [`ttype`](#ttype)
  + ### parseNumbers

    public void parseNumbers()

    Specifies that numbers should be parsed by this tokenizer. The
    syntax table of this tokenizer is modified so that each of the twelve
    characters:
    > ```
    >      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . -
    > ```

    has the "numeric" attribute.

    When the parser encounters a word token that has the format of a
    double precision floating-point number, it treats the token as a
    number rather than a word, by setting the `ttype`
    field to the value `TT_NUMBER` and putting the numeric
    value of the token into the `nval` field.

    See Also:
    :   - [`nval`](#nval)
        - [`TT_NUMBER`](#TT_NUMBER)
        - [`ttype`](#ttype)
  + ### eolIsSignificant

    public void eolIsSignificant(boolean flag)

    Determines whether or not ends of line are treated as tokens.
    If the flag argument is true, this tokenizer treats end of lines
    as tokens; the `nextToken` method returns
    `TT_EOL` and also sets the `ttype` field to
    this value when an end of line is read.

    A line is a sequence of characters ending with either a
    carriage-return character (`'\r'`) or a newline
    character (`'\n'`). In addition, a carriage-return
    character followed immediately by a newline character is treated
    as a single end-of-line token.

    If the `flag` is false, end-of-line characters are
    treated as white space and serve only to separate tokens.

    Parameters:
    :   `flag` - `true` indicates that end-of-line characters
        are separate tokens; `false` indicates that
        end-of-line characters are white space.

    See Also:
    :   - [`nextToken()`](#nextToken())
        - [`ttype`](#ttype)
        - [`TT_EOL`](#TT_EOL)
  + ### slashStarComments

    public void slashStarComments(boolean flag)

    Determines whether or not the tokenizer recognizes C-style comments.
    If the flag argument is `true`, this stream tokenizer
    recognizes C-style comments. All text between successive
    occurrences of `/*` and `*/` are discarded.

    If the flag argument is `false`, then C-style comments
    are not treated specially.

    Parameters:
    :   `flag` - `true` indicates to recognize and ignore
        C-style comments.
  + ### slashSlashComments

    public void slashSlashComments(boolean flag)

    Determines whether or not the tokenizer recognizes C++-style comments.
    If the flag argument is `true`, this stream tokenizer
    recognizes C++-style comments. Any occurrence of two consecutive
    slash characters (`'/'`) is treated as the beginning of
    a comment that extends to the end of the line.

    If the flag argument is `false`, then C++-style
    comments are not treated specially.

    Parameters:
    :   `flag` - `true` indicates to recognize and ignore
        C++-style comments.
  + ### lowerCaseMode

    public void lowerCaseMode(boolean fl)

    Determines whether or not word token are automatically lowercased.
    If the flag argument is `true`, then the value in the
    `sval` field is lowercased whenever a word token is
    returned (the `ttype` field has the
    value `TT_WORD` by the `nextToken` method
    of this tokenizer.

    If the flag argument is `false`, then the
    `sval` field is not modified.

    Parameters:
    :   `fl` - `true` indicates that all word tokens should
        be lowercased.

    See Also:
    :   - [`nextToken()`](#nextToken())
        - [`ttype`](#ttype)
        - [`TT_WORD`](#TT_WORD)
  + ### nextToken

    public int nextToken()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Parses the next token from the input stream of this tokenizer.
    The type of the next token is returned in the `ttype`
    field. Additional information about the token may be in the
    `nval` field or the `sval` field of this
    tokenizer.

    Typical clients of this
    class first set up the syntax tables and then sit in a loop
    calling nextToken to parse successive tokens until TT\_EOF
    is returned.

    Returns:
    :   the value of the `ttype` field.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs.

    :   - [`nval`](#nval)
        - [`sval`](#sval)
        - [`ttype`](#ttype)
  + ### pushBack

    public void pushBack()

    Causes the next call to the `nextToken` method of this
    tokenizer to return the current value in the `ttype`
    field, and not to modify the value in the `nval` or
    `sval` field.

  + ### lineno

    public int lineno()

    Return the current line number.

    Returns:
    :   the current line number of this stream tokenizer.
  + ### toString

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Returns the string representation of the current stream token and
    the line number it occurs on.

    The precise string returned is unspecified, although the following
    example can be considered typical:
    > ```
    >          Token['a'], line 10
    > ```

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
