java.io.ObjectOutputStream

All Implemented Interfaces:

---

public class ObjectOutputStream
extends [OutputStream](OutputStream.md "class in java.io")
implements [ObjectOutput](ObjectOutput.md "interface in java.io"), [ObjectStreamConstants](ObjectStreamConstants.md "interface in java.io")

An ObjectOutputStream writes primitive data types and graphs of Java objects
to an OutputStream. The objects can be read (reconstituted) using an
ObjectInputStream. Persistent storage of objects can be accomplished by
using a file for the stream. If the stream is a network socket stream, the
objects can be reconstituted on another host or in another process.

Only objects that support the java.io.Serializable interface can be
written to streams. The class of each serializable object is encoded
including the class name and signature of the class, the values of the
object's fields and arrays, and the closure of any other objects referenced
from the initial objects.

The method writeObject is used to write an object to the stream. Any
object, including Strings and arrays, is written with writeObject. Multiple
objects or primitives can be written to the stream. The objects must be
read back from the corresponding ObjectInputstream with the same types and
in the same order as they were written.

Primitive data types can also be written to the stream using the
appropriate methods from DataOutput. Strings can also be written using the
writeUTF method.

The default serialization mechanism for an object writes the class of the
object, the class signature, and the values of all non-transient and
non-static fields. References to other objects (except in transient or
static fields) cause those objects to be written also. Multiple references
to a single object are encoded using a reference sharing mechanism so that
graphs of objects can be restored to the same shape as when the original was
written.

For example to write an object that can be read by the example in
[`ObjectInputStream`](ObjectInputStream.md "class in java.io"):

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

```
     try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("t.tmp");
          ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos)) {
         oos.writeObject("Today");
         oos.writeObject(LocalDateTime.now());
     } catch (Exception ex) {
         // handle exception
     }
```

Serializable classes that require special handling during the
serialization and deserialization process should implement methods
with the following signatures:

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

```
    private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream stream)
        throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;
    private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream stream)
        throws IOException;
    private void readObjectNoData()
        throws ObjectStreamException;
```

The method name, modifiers, return type, and number and type of
parameters must match exactly for the method to be used by
serialization or deserialization. The methods should only be
declared to throw checked exceptions consistent with these
signatures.

The writeObject method is responsible for writing the state of the object
for its particular class so that the corresponding readObject method can
restore it. The method does not need to concern itself with the state
belonging to the object's superclasses or subclasses. State is saved by
writing the individual fields to the ObjectOutputStream using the
writeObject method or by using the methods for primitive data types
supported by DataOutput.

Serialization does not write out the fields of any object that does not
implement the java.io.Serializable interface. Subclasses of Objects that
are not serializable can be serializable. In this case the non-serializable
class must have a no-arg constructor to allow its fields to be initialized.
In this case it is the responsibility of the subclass to save and restore
the state of the non-serializable class. It is frequently the case that the
fields of that class are accessible (public, package, or protected) or that
there are get and set methods that can be used to restore the state.

Serialization of an object can be prevented by implementing writeObject
and readObject methods that throw the NotSerializableException. The
exception will be caught by the ObjectOutputStream and abort the
serialization process.

Implementing the Externalizable interface allows the object to assume
complete control over the contents and format of the object's serialized
form. The methods of the Externalizable interface, writeExternal and
readExternal, are called to save and restore the objects state. When
implemented by a class they can write and read their own state using all of
the methods of ObjectOutput and ObjectInput. It is the responsibility of
the objects to handle any versioning that occurs.

Enum constants are serialized differently than ordinary serializable or
externalizable objects. The serialized form of an enum constant consists
solely of its name; field values of the constant are not transmitted. To
serialize an enum constant, ObjectOutputStream writes the string returned by
the constant's name method. Like other serializable or externalizable
objects, enum constants can function as the targets of back references
appearing subsequently in the serialization stream. The process by which
enum constants are serialized cannot be customized; any class-specific
writeObject and writeReplace methods defined by enum types are ignored
during serialization. Similarly, any serialPersistentFields or
serialVersionUID field declarations are also ignored--all enum types have a
fixed serialVersionUID of 0L.

Primitive data, excluding serializable fields and externalizable data, is
written to the ObjectOutputStream in block-data records. A block data record
is composed of a header and data. The block data header consists of a marker
and the number of bytes to follow the header. Consecutive primitive data
writes are merged into one block-data record. The blocking factor used for
a block-data record will be 1024 bytes. Each block-data record will be
filled up to 1024 bytes, or be written whenever there is a termination of
block-data mode. Calls to the ObjectOutputStream methods writeObject,
defaultWriteObject and writeFields initially terminate any existing
block-data record.

Records are serialized differently than ordinary serializable or externalizable
objects, see [record serialization](ObjectInputStream.md#record-serialization).

* ## Constructor Details

  + ### ObjectOutputStream

    public ObjectOutputStream([OutputStream](OutputStream.md "class in java.io") out)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Creates an ObjectOutputStream that writes to the specified OutputStream.
    This constructor writes the serialization stream header to the
    underlying stream; callers may wish to flush the stream immediately to
    ensure that constructors for receiving ObjectInputStreams will not block
    when reading the header.

    If a security manager is installed, this constructor will check for
    the "enableSubclassImplementation" SerializablePermission when invoked
    directly or indirectly by the constructor of a subclass which overrides
    the ObjectOutputStream.putFields or ObjectOutputStream.writeUnshared
    methods.

    Parameters:
    :   `out` - output stream to write to

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs while writing stream header
    :   `SecurityException` - if untrusted subclass illegally overrides
        security-sensitive methods
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `out` is `null`

    Since:
    :   1.4

  + ### ObjectOutputStream

    protected ObjectOutputStream()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io"),
    [SecurityException](../lang/SecurityException.md "class in java.lang")

    Provide a way for subclasses that are completely reimplementing
    ObjectOutputStream to not have to allocate private data just used by
    this implementation of ObjectOutputStream.

    If there is a security manager installed, this method first calls the
    security manager's `checkPermission` method with a
    `SerializablePermission("enableSubclassImplementation")`
    permission to ensure it's ok to enable subclassing.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its
        `checkPermission` method denies enabling
        subclassing.
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs while creating this stream

* ## Method Details

  + ### useProtocolVersion

    public void useProtocolVersion(int version)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Specify stream protocol version to use when writing the stream.

    This routine provides a hook to enable the current version of
    Serialization to write in a format that is backwards compatible to a
    previous version of the stream format.

    Every effort will be made to avoid introducing additional
    backwards incompatibilities; however, sometimes there is no
    other alternative.

    Parameters:
    :   `version` - use ProtocolVersion from java.io.ObjectStreamConstants.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if called after any objects
        have been serialized.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if invalid version is passed in.
    :   `IOException` - if I/O errors occur

    Since:
    :   1.2

    See Also:
    :   - [`ObjectStreamConstants.PROTOCOL_VERSION_1`](ObjectStreamConstants.md#PROTOCOL_VERSION_1)
        - [`ObjectStreamConstants.PROTOCOL_VERSION_2`](ObjectStreamConstants.md#PROTOCOL_VERSION_2)
  + ### writeObject

    public final void writeObject([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") obj)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Write the specified object to the ObjectOutputStream. The class of the
    object, the signature of the class, and the values of the non-transient
    and non-static fields of the class and all of its supertypes are
    written. Default serialization for a class can be overridden using the
    writeObject and the readObject methods. Objects referenced by this
    object are written transitively so that a complete equivalent graph of
    objects can be reconstructed by an ObjectInputStream.

    Exceptions are thrown for problems with the OutputStream and for
    classes that should not be serialized. All exceptions are fatal to the
    OutputStream, which is left in an indeterminate state, and it is up to
    the caller to ignore or recover the stream state.

    Specified by:
    :   `writeObject` in interface `ObjectOutput`

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - the object to be written

    Throws:
    :   `InvalidClassException` - Something is wrong with a class used by
        serialization.
    :   `NotSerializableException` - Some object to be serialized does not
        implement the java.io.Serializable interface.
    :   `IOException` - Any exception thrown by the underlying
        OutputStream.
  + ### writeObjectOverride

    protected void writeObjectOverride([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") obj)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Method used by subclasses to override the default writeObject method.
    This method is called by trusted subclasses of ObjectOutputStream that
    constructed ObjectOutputStream using the protected no-arg constructor.
    The subclass is expected to provide an override method with the modifier
    "final".

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - object to be written to the underlying stream

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if there are I/O errors while writing to the
        underlying stream

    Since:
    :   1.2

    See Also:
    :   - [`ObjectOutputStream()`](#%3Cinit%3E())
        - [`writeObject(Object)`](#writeObject(java.lang.Object))
  + ### writeUnshared

    public void writeUnshared([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") obj)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Writes an "unshared" object to the ObjectOutputStream. This method is
    identical to writeObject, except that it always writes the given object
    as a new, unique object in the stream (as opposed to a back-reference
    pointing to a previously serialized instance). Specifically:
    - An object written via writeUnshared is always serialized in the
      same manner as a newly appearing object (an object that has not
      been written to the stream yet), regardless of whether or not the
      object has been written previously.- If writeObject is used to write an object that has been previously
        written with writeUnshared, the previous writeUnshared operation
        is treated as if it were a write of a separate object. In other
        words, ObjectOutputStream will never generate back-references to
        object data written by calls to writeUnshared.While writing an object via writeUnshared does not in itself guarantee a
    unique reference to the object when it is deserialized, it allows a
    single object to be defined multiple times in a stream, so that multiple
    calls to readUnshared by the receiver will not conflict. Note that the
    rules described above only apply to the base-level object written with
    writeUnshared, and not to any transitively referenced sub-objects in the
    object graph to be serialized.

    ObjectOutputStream subclasses which override this method can only be
    constructed in security contexts possessing the
    "enableSubclassImplementation" SerializablePermission; any attempt to
    instantiate such a subclass without this permission will cause a
    SecurityException to be thrown.

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - object to write to stream

    Throws:
    :   `NotSerializableException` - if an object in the graph to be
        serialized does not implement the Serializable interface
    :   `InvalidClassException` - if a problem exists with the class of an
        object to be serialized
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs during serialization

    Since:
    :   1.4
  + ### defaultWriteObject

    public void defaultWriteObject()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Write the non-static and non-transient fields of the current class to
    this stream. This may only be called from the writeObject method of the
    class being serialized. It will throw the NotActiveException if it is
    called otherwise.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if I/O errors occur while writing to the underlying
        `OutputStream`
  + ### putFields

    public [ObjectOutputStream.PutField](ObjectOutputStream.PutField.md "class in java.io") putFields()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Retrieve the object used to buffer persistent fields to be written to
    the stream. The fields will be written to the stream when writeFields
    method is called.

    Returns:
    :   an instance of the class Putfield that holds the serializable
        fields

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if I/O errors occur

    Since:
    :   1.2
  + ### writeFields

    public void writeFields()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Write the buffered fields to the stream.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if I/O errors occur while writing to the underlying
        stream
    :   `NotActiveException` - Called when a classes writeObject method was
        not called to write the state of the object.

    Since:
    :   1.2
  + ### reset

    public void reset()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reset will disregard the state of any objects already written to the
    stream. The state is reset to be the same as a new ObjectOutputStream.
    The current point in the stream is marked as reset so the corresponding
    ObjectInputStream will be reset at the same point. Objects previously
    written to the stream will not be referred to as already being in the
    stream. They will be written to the stream again.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if reset() is invoked while serializing an object.
  + ### annotateClass

    protected void annotateClass([Class](../lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<?> cl)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Subclasses may implement this method to allow class data to be stored in
    the stream. By default this method does nothing. The corresponding
    method in ObjectInputStream is resolveClass. This method is called
    exactly once for each unique class in the stream. The class name and
    signature will have already been written to the stream. This method may
    make free use of the ObjectOutputStream to save any representation of
    the class it deems suitable (for example, the bytes of the class file).
    The resolveClass method in the corresponding subclass of
    ObjectInputStream must read and use any data or objects written by
    annotateClass.

    Parameters:
    :   `cl` - the class to annotate custom data for

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - Any exception thrown by the underlying
        OutputStream.
  + ### annotateProxyClass

    protected void annotateProxyClass([Class](../lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<?> cl)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Subclasses may implement this method to store custom data in the stream
    along with descriptors for dynamic proxy classes.

    This method is called exactly once for each unique proxy class
    descriptor in the stream. The default implementation of this method in
    `ObjectOutputStream` does nothing.

    The corresponding method in `ObjectInputStream` is
    `resolveProxyClass`. For a given subclass of
    `ObjectOutputStream` that overrides this method, the
    `resolveProxyClass` method in the corresponding subclass of
    `ObjectInputStream` must read any data or objects written by
    `annotateProxyClass`.

    Parameters:
    :   `cl` - the proxy class to annotate custom data for

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - any exception thrown by the underlying
        `OutputStream`

    Since:
    :   1.3

    See Also:
    :   - [`ObjectInputStream.resolveProxyClass(String[])`](ObjectInputStream.md#resolveProxyClass(java.lang.String%5B%5D))
  + ### replaceObject

    protected [Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") replaceObject([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") obj)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    This method will allow trusted subclasses of ObjectOutputStream to
    substitute one object for another during serialization. Replacing
    objects is disabled until enableReplaceObject is called. The
    enableReplaceObject method checks that the stream requesting to do
    replacement can be trusted. The first occurrence of each object written
    into the serialization stream is passed to replaceObject. Subsequent
    references to the object are replaced by the object returned by the
    original call to replaceObject. To ensure that the private state of
    objects is not unintentionally exposed, only trusted streams may use
    replaceObject.

    The ObjectOutputStream.writeObject method takes a parameter of type
    Object (as opposed to type Serializable) to allow for cases where
    non-serializable objects are replaced by serializable ones.

    When a subclass is replacing objects it must ensure that either a
    complementary substitution must be made during deserialization or that
    the substituted object is compatible with every field where the
    reference will be stored. Objects whose type is not a subclass of the
    type of the field or array element abort the serialization by raising an
    exception and the object is not be stored.

    This method is called only once when each object is first
    encountered. All subsequent references to the object will be redirected
    to the new object. This method should return the object to be
    substituted or the original object.

    Null can be returned as the object to be substituted, but may cause
    [`NullPointerException`](../lang/NullPointerException.md "class in java.lang") in classes that contain references to the
    original object since they may be expecting an object instead of
    null.

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - the object to be replaced

    Returns:
    :   the alternate object that replaced the specified one

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - Any exception thrown by the underlying
        OutputStream.
  + ### enableReplaceObject

    protected boolean enableReplaceObject(boolean enable)
    throws [SecurityException](../lang/SecurityException.md "class in java.lang")

    Enables the stream to do replacement of objects written to the stream. When
    enabled, the [`replaceObject(java.lang.Object)`](#replaceObject(java.lang.Object)) method is called for every object being
    serialized.

    If object replacement is currently not enabled, and
    `enable` is true, and there is a security manager installed,
    this method first calls the security manager's
    `checkPermission` method with the
    `SerializablePermission("enableSubstitution")` permission to
    ensure that the caller is permitted to enable the stream to do replacement
    of objects written to the stream.

    Parameters:
    :   `enable` - true for enabling use of `replaceObject` for
        every object being serialized

    Returns:
    :   the previous setting before this method was invoked

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its
        `checkPermission` method denies enabling the stream
        to do replacement of objects written to the stream.

    See Also:
    :   - [`SecurityManager.checkPermission(java.security.Permission)`](../lang/SecurityManager.md#checkPermission(java.security.Permission))
        - [`SerializablePermission`](SerializablePermission.md "class in java.io")
  + ### writeStreamHeader

    protected void writeStreamHeader()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    The writeStreamHeader method is provided so subclasses can append or
    prepend their own header to the stream. It writes the magic number and
    version to the stream.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if I/O errors occur while writing to the underlying
        stream
  + ### writeClassDescriptor

    protected void writeClassDescriptor([ObjectStreamClass](ObjectStreamClass.md "class in java.io") desc)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Write the specified class descriptor to the ObjectOutputStream. Class
    descriptors are used to identify the classes of objects written to the
    stream. Subclasses of ObjectOutputStream may override this method to
    customize the way in which class descriptors are written to the
    serialization stream. The corresponding method in ObjectInputStream,
    [`readClassDescriptor`](ObjectInputStream.md#readClassDescriptor()), should then be overridden to
    reconstitute the class descriptor from its custom stream representation.
    By default, this method writes class descriptors according to the format
    defined in the [Java Object Serialization Specification](../../../../specs/serialization/index.md).

    Note that this method will only be called if the ObjectOutputStream
    is not using the old serialization stream format (set by calling
    ObjectOutputStream's `useProtocolVersion` method). If this
    serialization stream is using the old format
    (`PROTOCOL_VERSION_1`), the class descriptor will be written
    internally in a manner that cannot be overridden or customized.

    Parameters:
    :   `desc` - class descriptor to write to the stream

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error has occurred.

    Since:
    :   1.3
