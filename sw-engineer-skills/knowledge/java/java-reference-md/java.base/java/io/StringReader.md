* ## Constructor Details

  + ### StringReader

    public StringReader([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") s)

    Creates a new string reader.

    Parameters:
    :   `s` - String providing the character stream.
* ## Method Details

  + ### read

    public int read()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads a single character.

    Overrides:
    :   `read` in class `Reader`

    Returns:
    :   The character read, or -1 if the end of the stream has been
        reached

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### read

    public int read(char[] cbuf,
    int off,
    int len)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads characters into a portion of an array.

    If `len` is zero, then no characters are read and `0` is
    returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at least one character.
    If no character is available because the stream is at its end, the value
    `-1` is returned; otherwise, at least one character is read and
    stored into `cbuf`.

    Specified by:
    :   `read` in class `Reader`

    Parameters:
    :   `cbuf` - Destination buffer
    :   `off` - Offset at which to start storing characters
    :   `len` - Maximum number of characters to read

    Returns:
    :   The number of characters read, or -1 if the end of the
        stream has been reached

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If `off` is negative, or `len` is negative,
        or `len` is greater than `cbuf.length - off`
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### skip

    public long skip(long n)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Skips characters. If the stream is already at its end before this method
    is invoked, then no characters are skipped and zero is returned.

    The `n` parameter may be negative, even though the
    `skip` method of the [`Reader`](Reader.md "class in java.io") superclass throws
    an exception in this case. Negative values of `n` cause the
    stream to skip backwards. Negative return values indicate a skip
    backwards. It is not possible to skip backwards past the beginning of
    the string.

    If the entire string has been read or skipped, then this method has
    no effect and always returns `0`.

    Overrides:
    :   `skip` in class `Reader`

    Parameters:
    :   `n` - The number of characters to skip

    Returns:
    :   The number of characters actually skipped

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### ready

    public boolean ready()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Tells whether this stream is ready to be read.

    Overrides:
    :   `ready` in class `Reader`

    Returns:
    :   True if the next read() is guaranteed not to block for input

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If the stream is closed
  + ### markSupported

    public boolean markSupported()

    Tells whether this stream supports the mark() operation, which it does.

    Overrides:
    :   `markSupported` in class `Reader`

    Returns:
    :   true if and only if this stream supports the mark operation.
  + ### mark

    public void mark(int readAheadLimit)
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Marks the present position in the stream. Subsequent calls to reset()
    will reposition the stream to this point.

    Overrides:
    :   `mark` in class `Reader`

    Parameters:
    :   `readAheadLimit` - Limit on the number of characters that may be
        read while still preserving the mark. Because
        the stream's input comes from a string, there
        is no actual limit, so this argument must not
        be negative, but is otherwise ignored.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - If `readAheadLimit < 0`
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### reset

    public void reset()
    throws [IOException](IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Resets the stream to the most recent mark, or to the beginning of the
    string if it has never been marked.

    Overrides:
    :   `reset` in class `Reader`

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - If an I/O error occurs
  + ### close

    public void close()

    Closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with
    it. Once the stream has been closed, further read(),
    ready(), mark(), or reset() invocations will throw an IOException.
    Closing a previously closed stream has no effect. This method will block
    while there is another thread blocking on the reader.
