# Class ThreadGroup

[java.lang.Object](Object.md "class in java.lang")

java.lang.ThreadGroup

All Implemented Interfaces:
:   `Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler`

---

public class ThreadGroup
extends [Object](Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler](Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler.md "interface in java.lang")

A thread group represents a set of threads. In addition, a thread group can
also include other thread groups. The thread groups form a tree in which
every thread group except the initial thread group has a parent.

A thread group has a name and maximum priority. The name is specified
when creating the group and cannot be changed. The group's maximum priority
is the maximum priority for threads created in the group. It is initially
inherited from the parent thread group but may be changed using the [`setMaxPriority`](#setMaxPriority(int)) method.

A thread group is weakly [*reachable*](ref/package-summary.md#reachability) from its parent group so that it is eligible for garbage
collection when there are no [live](Thread.md#isAlive()) threads in the
group and the thread group is otherwise *unreachable*.

Unless otherwise specified, passing a `null` argument to a constructor
or method in this class will cause a [`NullPointerException`](NullPointerException.md "class in java.lang") to be thrown.

## Thread groups and virtual threads

The Java runtime creates a special thread group for
[virtual threads](Thread.md#virtual-threads). This group is
returned by the [`Thread.getThreadGroup`](Thread.md#getThreadGroup()) method
when invoked on a virtual thread. The thread group differs to other thread
groups in that its maximum priority is fixed and cannot be changed with the
[`setMaxPriority`](#setMaxPriority(int)) method.
Virtual threads are not included in the estimated thread count returned by the
[`activeCount`](#activeCount()) method, are not enumerated by the [`enumerate`](#enumerate(java.lang.Thread%5B%5D)) method, and are not interrupted by the [`interrupt`](#interrupt()) method.

* ## Constructor Details

  + ### ThreadGroup

    public ThreadGroup([String](String.md "class in java.lang") name)

    Constructs a new thread group. The parent of this new group is
    the thread group of the currently running thread.

    The `checkAccess` method of the parent thread group is
    called with no arguments; this may result in a security exception.

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - the name of the new thread group, can be `null`

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if the current thread cannot create a
        thread in the specified thread group.

  + ### ThreadGroup

    public ThreadGroup([ThreadGroup](ThreadGroup.md "class in java.lang") parent,
    [String](String.md "class in java.lang") name)

    Creates a new thread group. The parent of this new group is the
    specified thread group.

    The `checkAccess` method of the parent thread group is
    called with no arguments; this may result in a security exception.

    Parameters:
    :   `parent` - the parent thread group.
    :   `name` - the name of the new thread group, can be `null`

    Throws:

    Returns the parent of this thread group.

    First, if the parent is not `null`, the
    `checkAccess` method of the parent thread group is
    called with no arguments; this may result in a security exception.

    Returns:
    :   the parent of this thread group. The top-level thread group
        is the only thread group whose parent is `null`.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if the current thread cannot modify

  + ### isDaemon

    [@Deprecated](Deprecated.md "annotation interface in java.lang")([since](Deprecated.md#since())="16",
    [forRemoval](Deprecated.md#forRemoval())=true)
    public final boolean isDaemon()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    This method originally indicated if the thread group is a
    *daemon thread group* that is automatically destroyed
    when its last thread terminates. The concept of daemon
    thread group no longer exists.
    A thread group is eligible to be GC'ed when there are no
    live threads in the group and it is otherwise unreachable.

    Returns the daemon status of this thread group.
    The daemon status is not used for anything.

    Returns:
    :   the daemon status of this thread group
  + ### isDestroyed

    [@Deprecated](Deprecated.md "annotation interface in java.lang")([since](Deprecated.md#since())="16",
    [forRemoval](Deprecated.md#forRemoval())=true)
    public boolean isDestroyed()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    This method originally indicated if the thread group is
    destroyed. The ability to destroy a thread group and the
    concept of a destroyed thread group no longer exists.
    A thread group is eligible to be GC'ed when there are no
    live threads in the group and it is otherwise unreachable.

    Returns false.

    Returns:
    :   false

    Since:
    :   1.1
  + ### setDaemon

    [@Deprecated](Deprecated.md "annotation interface in java.lang")([since](Deprecated.md#since())="16",
    [forRemoval](Deprecated.md#forRemoval())=true)
    public final void setDaemon(boolean daemon)

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    This method originally configured whether the thread group is
    a *daemon thread group* that is automatically destroyed
    when its last thread terminates. The concept of daemon thread
    group no longer exists. A thread group is eligible to be GC'ed
    when there are no live threads in the group and it is otherwise
    unreachable.

    Sets the daemon status of this thread group.
    The daemon status is not used for anything.

    First, the `checkAccess` method of this thread group is
    called with no arguments; this may result in a security exception.

    Parameters:
    :   `daemon` - the daemon status

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if the current thread cannot modify
        this thread group.

    See Also:
    :   - [`SecurityException`](SecurityException.md "class in java.lang")
        - [`checkAccess()`](#checkAccess())
  + ### setMaxPriority

    public final void setMaxPriority(int pri)

    Sets the maximum priority of the group. The maximum priority of the
    [*ThreadGroup for virtual
    threads*](ThreadGroup.md#virtualthreadgroup) is not changed by this method (the new priority is ignored).
    Threads in the thread group (or subgroups) that already have a higher
    priority are not affected by this method.

    First, the `checkAccess` method of this thread group is
    called with no arguments; this may result in a security exception.

    If the `pri` argument is less than
    [`Thread.MIN_PRIORITY`](Thread.md#MIN_PRIORITY) or greater than
    [`Thread.MAX_PRIORITY`](Thread.md#MAX_PRIORITY), the maximum priority of the group
    remains unchanged.

    Otherwise, the priority of this ThreadGroup object is set to the
    smaller of the specified `pri` and the maximum permitted
    priority of the parent of this thread group. (If this thread group
    is the system thread group, which has no parent, then its maximum
    priority is simply set to `pri`.) Then this method is
    called recursively, with `pri` as its argument, for
    every thread group that belongs to this thread group.

    Parameters:
    :   `pri` - the new priority of the thread group.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if the current thread cannot modify
        this thread group.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getMaxPriority()`](#getMaxPriority())
        - [`SecurityException`](SecurityException.md "class in java.lang")
        - [`checkAccess()`](#checkAccess())
  + ### parentOf

    public final boolean parentOf([ThreadGroup](ThreadGroup.md "class in java.lang") g)

    Tests if this thread group is either the thread group
    argument or one of its ancestor thread groups.

    Parameters:
    :   `g` - a thread group, can be `null`

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this thread group is the thread group
        argument or one of its ancestor thread groups;
        `false` otherwise.
  + ### checkAccess

    [@Deprecated](Deprecated.md "annotation interface in java.lang")([since](Deprecated.md#since())="17",
    [forRemoval](Deprecated.md#forRemoval())=true)
    public final void checkAccess()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    This method is only useful in conjunction with
    [the Security Manager](SecurityManager.md "class in java.lang"), which is
    deprecated and subject to removal in a future release.
    Consequently, this method is also deprecated and subject to
    removal. There is no replacement for the Security Manager or this
    method.

    Determines if the currently running thread has permission to
    modify this thread group.

    If there is a security manager, its `checkAccess` method
    is called with this thread group as its argument. This may result
    in throwing a `SecurityException`.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if the current thread is not allowed to
        access this thread group.

    See Also:
    :   - [`SecurityManager.checkAccess(java.lang.ThreadGroup)`](SecurityManager.md#checkAccess(java.lang.ThreadGroup))
  + ### activeCount

    public int activeCount()

    Returns an estimate of the number of [live](Thread.md#isAlive())
    platform threads in this thread group and its subgroups. Virtual threads
    are not included in the estimate. This method recursively iterates over
    all subgroups in this thread group.

    The value returned is only an estimate because the number of
    threads may change dynamically while this method traverses internal
    data structures, and might be affected by the presence of certain
    system threads. This method is intended primarily for debugging
    and monitoring purposes.

    Returns:
    :   an estimate of the number of live threads in this thread
        group and in any other thread group that has this thread
        group as an ancestor
  + ### enumerate

    public int enumerate([Thread](Thread.md "class in java.lang")[] list)

    Copies into the specified array every [live](Thread.md#isAlive())
    platform thread in this thread group and its subgroups. Virtual threads
    are not enumerated by this method.

    An invocation of this method behaves in exactly the same
    way as the invocation
    > [enumerate](#enumerate(java.lang.Thread%5B%5D,boolean))`(list, true)`

    Parameters:
    :   `list` - an array into which to put the list of threads

    Returns:
    :   the number of threads put into the array

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if [checkAccess](#checkAccess()) determines that
        the current thread cannot access this thread group
  + ### enumerate

    public int enumerate([Thread](Thread.md "class in java.lang")[] list,
    boolean recurse)

    Copies into the specified array every [live](Thread.md#isAlive())
    platform thread in this thread group. Virtual threads are not enumerated
    by this method. If `recurse` is `true`, this method recursively
    enumerates all subgroups of this thread group and references to every live
    platform thread in these subgroups are also included. If the array is too
    short to hold all the threads, the extra threads are silently ignored.

    An application might use the [activeCount](#activeCount())
    method to get an estimate of how big the array should be, however
    *if the array is too short to hold all the threads, the extra threads
    are silently ignored.* If it is critical to obtain every live
    thread in this thread group, the caller should verify that the returned
    int value is strictly less than the length of `list`.

    Due to the inherent race condition in this method, it is recommended
    that the method only be used for debugging and monitoring purposes.

    Parameters:
    :   `list` - an array into which to put the list of threads
    :   `recurse` - if `true`, recursively enumerate all subgroups of this
        thread group

    Returns:
    :   the number of threads put into the array

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if [checkAccess](#checkAccess()) determines that
        the current thread cannot access this thread group
  + ### activeGroupCount

    public int activeGroupCount()

    Returns an estimate of the number of groups in this thread group and its
    subgroups. Recursively iterates over all subgroups in this thread group.

    The value returned is only an estimate because the number of
    thread groups may change dynamically while this method traverses
    internal data structures. This method is intended primarily for
    debugging and monitoring purposes.

    Returns:
    :   the number of thread groups with this thread group as
        an ancestor
  + ### enumerate

    public int enumerate([ThreadGroup](ThreadGroup.md "class in java.lang")[] list)

    Copies into the specified array references to every subgroup in this
    thread group and its subgroups.

    An invocation of this method behaves in exactly the same
    way as the invocation
    > [enumerate](#enumerate(java.lang.ThreadGroup%5B%5D,boolean))`(list, true)`

    Parameters:
    :   `list` - an array into which to put the list of thread groups

    Returns:
    :   the number of thread groups put into the array

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if [checkAccess](#checkAccess()) determines that
        the current thread cannot access this thread group
  + ### enumerate

    public int enumerate([ThreadGroup](ThreadGroup.md "class in java.lang")[] list,
    boolean recurse)

    Copies into the specified array references to every subgroup in this
    thread group. If `recurse` is `true`, this method recursively
    enumerates all subgroups of this thread group and references to every
    thread group in these subgroups are also included.

    An application might use the
    [activeGroupCount](#activeGroupCount()) method to
    get an estimate of how big the array should be, however *if the
    array is too short to hold all the thread groups, the extra thread
    groups are silently ignored.* If it is critical to obtain every
    subgroup in this thread group, the caller should verify that
    the returned int value is strictly less than the length of
    `list`.

    Due to the inherent race condition in this method, it is recommended
    that the method only be used for debugging and monitoring purposes.

    Parameters:
    :   `list` - an array into which to put the list of thread groups
    :   `recurse` - if `true`, recursively enumerate all subgroups

    Returns:
    :   the number of thread groups put into the array

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if [checkAccess](#checkAccess()) determines that
        the current thread cannot access this thread group
  + ### stop

    [@Deprecated](Deprecated.md "annotation interface in java.lang")([since](Deprecated.md#since())="1.2",
    [forRemoval](Deprecated.md#forRemoval())=true)
    public final void stop()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    This method was originally specified to stop all threads in
    the thread group. It was inherently unsafe.

    Throws `UnsupportedOperationException`.
  + ### interrupt

    public final void interrupt()

    Interrupts all [live](Thread.md#isAlive()) platform threads in
    this thread group and its subgroups.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if the current thread is not allowed
        to access this thread group or any of the threads in
        the thread group.

    Since:
    :   1.2

  + ### suspend

    [@Deprecated](Deprecated.md "annotation interface in java.lang")([since](Deprecated.md#since())="1.2",
    [forRemoval](Deprecated.md#forRemoval())=true)
    public final void suspend()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    This method was originally specified to suspend all threads
    in the thread group.

    Throws `UnsupportedOperationException`.
  + ### resume

    [@Deprecated](Deprecated.md "annotation interface in java.lang")([since](Deprecated.md#since())="1.2",
    [forRemoval](Deprecated.md#forRemoval())=true)
    public final void resume()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    This method was originally specified to resume all threads
    in the thread group.

    Throws `UnsupportedOperationException`.
  + ### destroy

    [@Deprecated](Deprecated.md "annotation interface in java.lang")([since](Deprecated.md#since())="16",
    [forRemoval](Deprecated.md#forRemoval())=true)
    public final void destroy()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    This method was originally specified to destroy an empty
    thread group. The ability to explicitly destroy a thread group
    no longer exists. A thread group is eligible to be GC'ed when
    there are no live threads in the group and it is otherwise
    unreachable.

    Does nothing.
  + ### list

    public void list()

    Prints information about this thread group to the standard
    output. This method is useful only for debugging.
  + ### uncaughtException

    public void uncaughtException([Thread](Thread.md "class in java.lang") t,
    [Throwable](Throwable.md "class in java.lang") e)

    Called by the Java Virtual Machine when a thread in this
    thread group stops because of an uncaught exception, and the thread
    does not have a specific [`Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler`](Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler.md "interface in java.lang")
    installed.

    The `uncaughtException` method of
    `ThreadGroup` does the following:
    - If this thread group has a parent thread group, the
      `uncaughtException` method of that parent is called
      with the same two arguments.- Otherwise, this method checks to see if there is a
        [default
        uncaught exception handler](Thread.md#getDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler()) installed, and if so, its
        `uncaughtException` method is called with the same
        two arguments.- Otherwise, a message containing the thread's name, as returned
          from the thread's [`getName`](Thread.md#getName()) method, and a
          stack backtrace, using the `Throwable`'s [`printStackTrace`](Throwable.md#printStackTrace()) method, is
          printed to the [standard error stream](System.md#err).

    Applications can override this method in subclasses of
    `ThreadGroup` to provide alternative handling of
    uncaught exceptions.

    Specified by:
    :   `uncaughtException` in interface `Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler`

    Parameters:
    :   `t` - the thread that is about to exit.
    :   `e` - the uncaught exception.
  + ### toString

    public [String](String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Returns a string representation of this Thread group.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a string representation of this thread group.
