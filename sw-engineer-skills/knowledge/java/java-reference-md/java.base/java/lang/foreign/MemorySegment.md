# Interface MemorySegment

---

public sealed interface MemorySegment

`MemorySegment` is a preview API of the Java platform.

Programs can only use `MemorySegment` when preview features are enabled.

Preview features may be removed in a future release, or upgraded to permanent features of the Java platform.

A memory segment provides access to a contiguous region of memory.

There are two kinds of memory segments:

* A *heap segment* is backed by, and provides access to, a region of memory inside the Java heap (an "on-heap" region).
* A *native segment* is backed by, and provides access to, a region of memory outside the Java heap (an "off-heap" region).

Heap segments can be obtained by calling one of the [`ofArray(int[])`](#ofArray(int%5B%5D)) factory methods.
These methods return a memory segment backed by the on-heap region that holds the specified Java array.

Native segments can be obtained by calling one of the [`Arena.allocate(long, long)`](Arena.md#allocate(long,long))[PREVIEW](Arena.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.Arena)
factory methods, which return a memory segment backed by a newly allocated off-heap region with the given size
and aligned to the given alignment constraint. Alternatively, native segments can be obtained by
[`mapping`](../../nio/channels/FileChannel.md#map(java.nio.channels.FileChannel.MapMode,long,long,java.lang.foreign.Arena))[PREVIEW](../../nio/channels/FileChannel.md#preview-map(java.nio.channels.FileChannel.MapMode,long,long,java.lang.foreign.Arena)) a file into a new off-heap region
(in some systems, this operation is sometimes referred to as `mmap`).
Segments obtained in this way are called *mapped* segments, and their contents can be [persisted](#force()) and
[loaded](#load()) to and from the underlying memory-mapped file.

Both kinds of segments are read and written using the same methods, known as [access operations](#segment-deref).
An access operation on a memory segment always and only provides access to the region for which the segment was obtained.

## Characteristics of memory segments

Every memory segment has an [address](#address()), expressed as a `long` value.
The nature of a segment's address depends on the kind of the segment:

* The address of a heap segment is not a physical address, but rather an offset within the region of memory
  which backs the segment. The region is inside the Java heap, so garbage collection might cause the region to be
  relocated in physical memory over time, but this is not exposed to clients of the `MemorySegment` API who
  see a stable *virtualized* address for a heap segment backed by the region.
  A heap segment obtained from one of the [`ofArray(int[])`](#ofArray(int%5B%5D)) factory methods has an address of zero.
* The address of a native segment (including mapped segments) denotes the physical address of the region of
  memory which backs the segment.

Every memory segment has a [size](#byteSize()). The size of a heap segment is derived from the Java array
from which it is obtained. This size is predictable across Java runtimes.
The size of a native segment is either passed explicitly
(as in [`Arena.allocate(long, long)`](Arena.md#allocate(long,long))[PREVIEW](Arena.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.Arena)) or derived from a [`MemoryLayout`](MemoryLayout.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](MemoryLayout.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemoryLayout)
(as in [`SegmentAllocator.allocate(MemoryLayout)`](SegmentAllocator.md#allocate(java.lang.foreign.MemoryLayout))[PREVIEW](SegmentAllocator.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.SegmentAllocator)). The size of a memory segment is typically
a positive number but may be [zero](#wrapping-addresses), but never negative.

The address and size of a memory segment jointly ensure that access operations on the segment cannot fall
*outside* the boundaries of the region of memory which backs the segment.
That is, a memory segment has *spatial bounds*.

Every memory segment is associated with a [scope](MemorySegment.Scope.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope). This ensures that access operations
on a memory segment cannot occur when the region of memory which backs the memory segment is no longer available
(e.g., after the scope associated with the accessed memory segment is no longer [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope)).
That is, a memory segment has *temporal bounds*.

Finally, access operations on a memory segment can be subject to additional thread-confinement checks.
Heap segments can be accessed from any thread. Conversely, native segments can only be accessed compatibly with the
[confinement characteristics](Arena.md#thread-confinement) of the arena used to obtain them.

## Accessing memory segments

A memory segment can be read or written using various access operations provided in this class (e.g. [`get(ValueLayout.OfInt, long)`](#get(java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout.OfInt,long))).
Each access operation takes a [value layout](ValueLayout.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](ValueLayout.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout), which specifies the size and shape of the value,
and an offset, expressed in bytes.
For instance, to read an int from a segment, using [default endianness](../../nio/ByteOrder.md#nativeOrder()), the following code can be used:

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

```
MemorySegment segment = ...
int value = segment.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0);
```

If the value to be read is stored in memory using [big-endian](../../nio/ByteOrder.md#BIG_ENDIAN) encoding, the access operation
can be expressed as follows:

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

```
MemorySegment segment = ...
int value = segment.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.withOrder(BIG_ENDIAN), 0);
```

For more complex access operations (e.g. structured memory access), clients can obtain a
[var handle](../invoke/MethodHandles.md#memorySegmentViewVarHandle(java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout))[PREVIEW](../invoke/MethodHandles.md#preview-memorySegmentViewVarHandle(java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout))
that accepts a segment and a `long` offset. More complex var handles
can be obtained by adapting a segment var handle view using the var handle combinator functions defined in the
[`MethodHandles`](../invoke/MethodHandles.md "class in java.lang.invoke") class:

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

```
MemorySegment segment = ...
VarHandle intHandle = MethodHandles.memorySegmentViewVarHandle(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT);
MethodHandle multiplyExact = MethodHandles.lookup()
                                          .findStatic(Math.class, "multiplyExact",
                                                                  MethodType.methodType(long.class, long.class, long.class));
intHandle = MethodHandles.filterCoordinates(intHandle, 1,
                                            MethodHandles.insertArguments(multiplyExact, 0, ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.byteSize()));
int value = (int) intHandle.get(segment, 3L); // get int element at offset 3 * 4 = 12
```

Alternatively, complex var handles can can be obtained
from [memory layouts](MemoryLayout.md#varHandle(java.lang.foreign.MemoryLayout.PathElement...))[PREVIEW](MemoryLayout.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemoryLayout)
by providing a so called [*layout path*](MemoryLayout.md#layout-paths):

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

```
MemorySegment segment = ...
VarHandle intHandle = ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.arrayElementVarHandle();
int value = (int) intHandle.get(segment, 3L); // get int element at offset 3 * 4 = 12
```

## Slicing memory segments

Memory segments support [slicing](#asSlice(long,long)). Slicing a memory segment
returns a new memory segment that is backed by the same region of memory as the original. The address of the sliced
segment is derived from the address of the original segment, by adding an offset (expressed in bytes). The size of
the sliced segment is either derived implicitly (by subtracting the specified offset from the size of the original segment),
or provided explicitly. In other words, a sliced segment has *stricter* spatial bounds than those of the original segment:

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

```
 Arena arena = ...
 MemorySegment segment = arena.allocate(100);
 MemorySegment slice = segment.asSlice(50, 10);
 slice.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 20); // Out of bounds!
 arena.close();
 slice.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0); // Already closed!
```

The above code creates a native segment that is 100 bytes long; then, it creates a slice that starts at offset 50
of `segment`, and is 10 bytes long. That is, the address of the `slice` is `segment.address() + 50`,
and its size is 10. As a result, attempting to read an int value at offset 20 of the
`slice` segment will result in an exception. The [temporal bounds](Arena.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](Arena.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.Arena) of the original segment
is inherited by its slices; that is, when the scope associated with `segment` is no longer [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope),
`slice` will also be become inaccessible.

A client might obtain a [`Stream`](../../util/stream/Stream.md "interface in java.util.stream") from a segment, which can then be used to slice the segment (according to a given
element layout) and even allow multiple threads to work in parallel on disjoint segment slices
(to do this, the segment has to be [accessible](#isAccessibleBy(java.lang.Thread))
from multiple threads). The following code can be used to sum all int values in a memory segment in parallel:

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

```
 try (Arena arena = Arena.ofShared()) {
     SequenceLayout SEQUENCE_LAYOUT = MemoryLayout.sequenceLayout(1024, ValueLayout.JAVA_INT);
     MemorySegment segment = arena.allocate(SEQUENCE_LAYOUT);
     int sum = segment.elements(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT).parallel()
                      .mapToInt(s -> s.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0))
                      .sum();
 }
```

## Alignment

Access operations on a memory segment are constrained not only by the spatial and temporal bounds of the segment,
but also by the *alignment constraint* of the value layout specified to the operation. An access operation can
access only those offsets in the segment that denote addresses in physical memory which are *aligned* according
to the layout. An address in physical memory is *aligned* according to a layout if the address is an integer
multiple of the layout's alignment constraint. For example, the address 1000 is aligned according to an 8-byte alignment
constraint (because 1000 is an integer multiple of 8), and to a 4-byte alignment constraint, and to a 2-byte alignment
constraint; in contrast, the address 1004 is aligned according to a 4-byte alignment constraint, and to a 2-byte alignment
constraint, but not to an 8-byte alignment constraint.
Access operations are required to respect alignment because it can impact the performance of access operations, and
can also determine which access operations are available at a given physical address. For instance,
[atomic access operations](../invoke/VarHandle.md#compareAndSet(java.lang.Object...)) operations using
[`VarHandle`](../invoke/VarHandle.md "class in java.lang.invoke") are only permitted at aligned addresses. In addition, alignment
applies to an access operation whether the segment being accessed is a native segment or a heap segment.

If the segment being accessed is a native segment, then its [address](#address()) in physical memory can be
combined with the offset to obtain the *target address* in physical memory. The pseudo-function below demonstrates this:

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

```
boolean isAligned(MemorySegment segment, long offset, MemoryLayout layout) {
  return ((segment.address() + offset) % layout.byteAlignment()) == 0;
}
```

For example:

* A native segment with address 1000 can be accessed at offsets 0, 8, 16, 24, etc under an 8-byte alignment constraint,
  because the target addresses (1000, 1008, 1016, 1024) are 8-byte aligned.
  Access at offsets 1-7 or 9-15 or 17-23 is disallowed because the target addresses would not be 8-byte aligned.
* A native segment with address 1000 can be accessed at offsets 0, 4, 8, 12, etc under a 4-byte alignment constraint,
  because the target addresses (1000, 1004, 1008, 1012) are 4-byte aligned.
  Access at offsets 1-3 or 5-7 or 9-11 is disallowed because the target addresses would not be 4-byte aligned.
* A native segment with address 1000 can be accessed at offsets 0, 2, 4, 6, etc under a 2-byte alignment constraint,
  because the target addresses (1000, 1002, 1004, 1006) are 2-byte aligned.
  Access at offsets 1 or 3 or 5 is disallowed because the target addresses would not be 2-byte aligned.
* A native segment with address 1004 can be accessed at offsets 0, 4, 8, 12, etc under a 4-byte alignment constraint,
  and at offsets 0, 2, 4, 6, etc under a 2-byte alignment constraint.
  Under an 8-byte alignment constraint, it can be accessed at offsets 4, 12, 20, 28, etc.
* A native segment with address 1006 can be accessed at offsets 0, 2, 4, 6, etc under a 2-byte alignment constraint.
  Under a 4-byte alignment constraint, it can be accessed at offsets 2, 6, 10, 14, etc.
  Under an 8-byte alignment constraint, it can be accessed at offsets 2, 10, 18, 26, etc.* A native segment with address 1007 can be accessed at offsets 0, 1, 2, 3, etc under a 1-byte alignment constraint.
    Under a 2-byte alignment constraint, it can be accessed at offsets 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.
    Under a 4-byte alignment constraint, it can be accessed at offsets 1, 5, 9, 13, etc.
    Under an 8-byte alignment constraint, it can be accessed at offsets 1, 9, 17, 25, etc.

The alignment constraint used to access a segment is typically dictated by the shape of the data structure stored
in the segment. For example, if the programmer wishes to store a sequence of 8-byte values in a native segment, then
the segment should be allocated by specifying a 8-byte alignment constraint, either via [`Arena.allocate(long, long)`](Arena.md#allocate(long,long))[PREVIEW](Arena.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.Arena)
or [`SegmentAllocator.allocate(MemoryLayout)`](SegmentAllocator.md#allocate(java.lang.foreign.MemoryLayout))[PREVIEW](SegmentAllocator.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.SegmentAllocator). These factories ensure that the off-heap region of memory backing
the returned segment has a starting address that is 8-byte aligned. Subsequently, the programmer can access the
segment at the offsets of interest -- 0, 8, 16, 24, etc -- in the knowledge that every such access is aligned.

If the segment being accessed is a heap segment, then determining whether access is aligned is more complex.
The address of the segment in physical memory is not known, and is not even fixed (it may change when the segment
is relocated during garbage collection). This means that the address cannot be combined with the specified offset to
determine a target address in physical memory. Since the alignment constraint *always* refers to alignment of
addresses in physical memory, it is not possible in principle to determine if any offset in a heap segment is aligned.
For example, suppose the programmer chooses a 8-byte alignment constraint and tries
to access offset 16 in a heap segment. If the heap segment's address 0 corresponds to physical address 1000,
then the target address (1016) would be aligned, but if address 0 corresponds to physical address 1004,
then the target address (1020) would not be aligned. It is undesirable to allow access to target addresses that are
aligned according to the programmer's chosen alignment constraint, but might not be predictably aligned in physical memory
(e.g. because of platform considerations and/or garbage collection behavior).

In practice, the Java runtime lays out arrays in memory so that each n-byte element occurs at an n-byte
aligned physical address (except for `long[]` and `double[]`, where alignment is platform-dependent, as explained
below). The runtime preserves this invariant even if the array is relocated during garbage collection.
Access operations rely on this invariant to determine if the specified offset in a heap segment refers to an aligned
address in physical memory. For example:

* The starting physical address of a `short[]` array will be 2-byte aligned (e.g. 1006) so that successive
  short elements occur at 2-byte aligned addresses (e.g. 1006, 1008, 1010, 1012, etc). A heap segment backed by a
  `short[]` array can be accessed at offsets 0, 2, 4, 6, etc under a 2-byte alignment constraint. The segment cannot
  be accessed at *any* offset under a 4-byte alignment constraint, because there is no guarantee that the target
  address would be 4-byte aligned, e.g., offset 0 would correspond to physical address 1006 while offset 1 would correspond
  to physical address 1007. Similarly, the segment cannot be accessed at any offset under an 8-byte alignment constraint,
  because because there is no guarantee that the target address would be 8-byte aligned, e.g., offset 2 would correspond
  to physical address 1008 but offset 4 would correspond to physical address 1010.
* The starting physical address of a `long[]` array will be 8-byte aligned (e.g. 1000) on 64-bit platforms,
  so that successive long elements occur at 8-byte aligned addresses (e.g., 1000, 1008, 1016, 1024, etc.) On 64-bit platforms,
  a heap segment backed by a `long[]` array can be accessed at offsets 0, 8, 16, 24, etc under an 8-byte alignment
  constraint. In addition, the segment can be accessed at offsets 0, 4, 8, 12, etc under a 4-byte alignment constraint,
  because the target addresses (1000, 1004, 1008, 1012) are 4-byte aligned. And, the segment can be accessed at offsets
  0, 2, 4, 6, etc under a 2-byte alignment constraint, because the target addresses (e.g. 1000, 1002, 1004, 1006) are 2-byte aligned.
* The starting physical address of a `long[]` array will be 4-byte aligned (e.g. 1004) on 32-bit platforms,
  so that successive long elements occur at 4-byte aligned addresses (e.g., 1004, 1008, 1012, 1016, etc.) On 32-bit
  platforms, a heap segment backed by a `long[]` array can be accessed at offsets 0, 4, 8, 12, etc under a 4-byte
  alignment constraint, because the target addresses (1004, 1008, 1012, 1016) are 4-byte aligned. And, the segment
  can be accessed at offsets 0, 2, 4, 6, etc under a 2-byte alignment constraint, because the target addresses
  (e.g. 1000, 1002, 1004, 1006) are 2-byte aligned.

In other words, heap segments feature a (platform-dependent) *maximum* alignment which is derived from the
size of the elements of the Java array backing the segment, as shown in the following table:
> Maximum alignment of heap segments
>
> | Array type (of backing region) | Maximum supported alignment (in bytes) |
> | --- | --- |
> | `boolean[]` | `ValueLayout.JAVA_BOOLEAN.byteAlignment()` |
> | `byte[]` | `ValueLayout.JAVA_BYTE.byteAlignment()` |
> | `char[]` | `ValueLayout.JAVA_CHAR.byteAlignment()` |
> | `short[]` | `ValueLayout.JAVA_SHORT.byteAlignment()` |
> | `int[]` | `ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.byteAlignment()` |
> | `float[]` | `ValueLayout.JAVA_FLOAT.byteAlignment()` |
> | `long[]` | `ValueLayout.JAVA_LONG.byteAlignment()` |
> | `double[]` | `ValueLayout.JAVA_DOUBLE.byteAlignment()` |

Heap segments can only be accessed using a layout whose alignment is smaller or equal to the
maximum alignment associated with the heap segment. Attempting to access a heap segment using a layout
whose alignment is greater than the maximum alignment associated with the heap segment will fail,
as demonstrated in the following example:

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

```
MemorySegment byteSegment = MemorySegment.ofArray(new byte[10]);
byteSegment.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0); // fails: ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.byteAlignment() > ValueLayout.JAVA_BYTE.byteAlignment()
```

In such circumstances, clients have two options. They can use a heap segment backed by a different array
type (e.g. `long[]`), capable of supporting greater maximum alignment. More specifically, the maximum alignment
associated with `long[]` is set to `ValueLayout.JAVA_LONG.byteAlignment()` which is a platform-dependent
value (set to `ValueLayout.ADDRESS.byteSize()`). That is, `long[]`) is guaranteed to provide at least
8-byte alignment in 64-bit platforms, but only 4-byte alignment in 32-bit platforms:

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

```
MemorySegment longSegment = MemorySegment.ofArray(new long[10]);
longSegment.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0); // ok: ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.byteAlignment() <= ValueLayout.JAVA_LONG.byteAlignment()
```

Alternatively, they can invoke the access operation with an *unaligned layout*.
All unaligned layout constants (e.g. [`ValueLayout.JAVA_INT_UNALIGNED`](ValueLayout.md#JAVA_INT_UNALIGNED)[PREVIEW](ValueLayout.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout)) have their alignment constraint set to 1:

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

```
MemorySegment byteSegment = MemorySegment.ofArray(new byte[10]);
byteSegment.get(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT_UNALIGNED, 0); // ok: ValueLayout.JAVA_INT_UNALIGNED.byteAlignment() == ValueLayout.JAVA_BYTE.byteAlignment()
```

## Zero-length memory segments

When interacting with [foreign functions](package-summary.md#ffa), it is common for those functions
to allocate a region of memory and return a pointer to that region. Modeling the region of memory with a memory segment
is challenging because the Java runtime has no insight into the size of the region. Only the address of the start of
the region, stored in the pointer, is available. For example, a C function with return type `char*` might return
a pointer to a region containing a single `char` value, or to a region containing an array of `char` values,
where the size of the array might be provided in a separate parameter. The size of the array is not readily apparent
to the code calling the foreign function and hoping to use its result. In addition to having no insight
into the size of the region of memory backing a pointer returned from a foreign function, it also has no insight
into the lifetime intended for said region of memory by the foreign function that allocated it.

The `MemorySegment` API uses *zero-length memory segments* to represent:

* pointers [returned from a foreign function](Linker.md#by-ref);
* pointers [passed by a foreign function to an upcall stub](Linker.md#function-pointers); and
* pointers read from a memory segment (more on that below).

The address of the zero-length segment is the address stored in the pointer. The spatial and temporal bounds of the
zero-length segment are as follows:

* The size of the segment is zero. any attempt to access these segments will fail with [`IndexOutOfBoundsException`](../IndexOutOfBoundsException.md "class in java.lang").
  This is a crucial safety feature: as these segments are associated with a region
  of memory whose size is not known, any access operations involving these segments cannot be validated.
  In effect, a zero-length memory segment *wraps* an address, and it cannot be used without explicit intent
  (see below);
* The segment is associated with a fresh scope that is always alive. Thus, while zero-length
  memory segments cannot be accessed directly, they can be passed, opaquely, to other pointer-accepting foreign functions.

To demonstrate how clients can work with zero-length memory segments, consider the case of a client that wants
to read a pointer from some memory segment. This can be done via the
[get(AddressLayout, long)](#get(java.lang.foreign.AddressLayout,long)) access method. This method accepts an
[address layout](AddressLayout.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](AddressLayout.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.AddressLayout) (e.g. [`ValueLayout.ADDRESS`](ValueLayout.md#ADDRESS)[PREVIEW](ValueLayout.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout)), the layout of the pointer
to be read. For instance on a 64-bit platform, the size of an address layout is 8 bytes. The access operation
also accepts an offset, expressed in bytes, which indicates the position (relative to the start of the memory segment)
at which the pointer is stored. The access operation returns a zero-length native memory segment, backed by a region
of memory whose starting address is the 64-bit value read at the specified offset.

The returned zero-length memory segment cannot be accessed directly by the client: since the size of the segment
is zero, any access operation would result in out-of-bounds access. Instead, the client must, *unsafely*,
assign new spatial bounds to the zero-length memory segment. This can be done via the
[`reinterpret(long)`](#reinterpret(long)) method, as follows:

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

```
 MemorySegment z = segment.get(ValueLayout.ADDRESS, ...);   // size = 0
 MemorySegment ptr = z.reinterpret(16);                     // size = 16
 int x = ptr.getAtIndex(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 3);           // ok
```

In some cases, the client might additionally want to assign new temporal bounds to a zero-length memory segment.
This can be done via the [`reinterpret(long, Arena, Consumer)`](#reinterpret(long,java.lang.foreign.Arena,java.util.function.Consumer)) method, which returns a
new native segment with the desired size and the same temporal bounds as those of the provided arena:

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

```
 MemorySegment ptr = null;
 try (Arena arena = Arena.ofConfined()) {
       MemorySegment z = segment.get(ValueLayout.ADDRESS, ...);    // size = 0, scope = always alive
       ptr = z.reinterpret(16, arena, null);                       // size = 4, scope = arena.scope()
       int x = ptr.getAtIndex(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 3);            // ok
 }
 int x = ptr.getAtIndex(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 3);                  // throws IllegalStateException
```

Alternatively, if the size of the region of memory backing the zero-length memory segment is known statically,
the client can overlay a [target layout](AddressLayout.md#withTargetLayout(java.lang.foreign.MemoryLayout))[PREVIEW](AddressLayout.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.AddressLayout) on the address
layout used when reading a pointer. The target layout is then used to dynamically
*expand* the size of the native memory segment returned by the access operation, so that the size
of the segment is the same as the size of the target layout. In other words, the returned segment is no
longer a zero-length memory segment, and the pointer it represents can be dereferenced directly:

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

```
 AddressLayout intArrPtrLayout = ValueLayout.ADDRESS.withTargetLayout(
         MemoryLayout.sequenceLayout(4, ValueLayout.JAVA_INT)); // layout for int (*ptr)[4]
 MemorySegment ptr = segment.get(intArrPtrLayout, ...);         // size = 16
 int x = ptr.getAtIndex(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 3);               // ok
```

All the methods which can be used to manipulate zero-length memory segments
([`reinterpret(long)`](#reinterpret(long)), [`reinterpret(Arena, Consumer)`](#reinterpret(java.lang.foreign.Arena,java.util.function.Consumer)), [`reinterpret(long, Arena, Consumer)`](#reinterpret(long,java.lang.foreign.Arena,java.util.function.Consumer)) and
[`AddressLayout.withTargetLayout(MemoryLayout)`](AddressLayout.md#withTargetLayout(java.lang.foreign.MemoryLayout))[PREVIEW](AddressLayout.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.AddressLayout)) are
[*restricted*](package-summary.md#restricted) methods, and should be used with caution:
assigning a segment incorrect spatial and/or temporal bounds could result in a VM crash when attempting to access
the memory segment.

    A zero-length native segment modelling the `NULL` address.
* ## Method Details

  + ### address

    long address()

    Returns the address of this memory segment.

    Returns:
    :   the address of this memory segment
  + ### heapBase

    [Optional](../../util/Optional.md "class in java.util")<[Object](../Object.md "class in java.lang")> heapBase()

    Returns the Java object stored in the on-heap region of memory backing this memory segment, if any. For instance, if this
    memory segment is a heap segment created with the [`ofArray(byte[])`](#ofArray(byte%5B%5D)) factory method, this method will return the
    `byte[]` object which was used to obtain the segment. This method returns an empty `Optional` value
    if either this segment is a [native](#isNative()) segment, or if this segment is [read-only](#isReadOnly()).

    Returns:
    :   the Java object associated with this memory segment, if any.
  + ### spliterator

    [Spliterator](../../util/Spliterator.md "interface in java.util")<[MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment)> spliterator([MemoryLayout](MemoryLayout.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](MemoryLayout.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemoryLayout) elementLayout)

    Returns a spliterator for this memory segment. The returned spliterator reports [`Spliterator.SIZED`](../../util/Spliterator.md#SIZED),
    [`Spliterator.SUBSIZED`](../../util/Spliterator.md#SUBSIZED), [`Spliterator.IMMUTABLE`](../../util/Spliterator.md#IMMUTABLE), [`Spliterator.NONNULL`](../../util/Spliterator.md#NONNULL) and [`Spliterator.ORDERED`](../../util/Spliterator.md#ORDERED)
    characteristics.

    The returned spliterator splits this segment according to the specified element layout; that is,
    if the supplied layout has size N, then calling [`Spliterator.trySplit()`](../../util/Spliterator.md#trySplit()) will result in a spliterator serving
    approximately `S/N` elements (depending on whether N is even or not), where `S` is the size of
    this segment. As such, splitting is possible as long as `S/N >= 2`. The spliterator returns segments that
    have the same lifetime as that of this segment.

    The returned spliterator effectively allows to slice this segment into disjoint [slices](#asSlice(long,long)),
    which can then be processed in parallel by multiple threads.

    Parameters:
    :   `elementLayout` - the layout to be used for splitting.

    Returns:
    :   the element spliterator for this segment

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `elementLayout.byteSize() == 0`.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `byteSize() % elementLayout.byteSize() != 0`.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `elementLayout.byteSize() % elementLayout.byteAlignment() != 0`.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if this segment is [incompatible
        with the alignment constraint](MemorySegment.md#segment-alignment) in the provided layout.

  + ### reinterpret

    [MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment) reinterpret(long newSize)

    Returns a new memory segment that has the same address and scope as this segment, but with the provided size.

    This method is [*restricted*](package-summary.md#restricted).
    Restricted methods are unsafe, and, if used incorrectly, their use might crash
    the JVM or, worse, silently result in memory corruption. Thus, clients should refrain from depending on
    restricted methods, and use safe and supported functionalities, where possible.

    Parameters:
    :   `newSize` - the size of the returned segment.

    Returns:
    :   a new memory segment that has the same address and scope as this segment, but the new
        provided size.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `newSize < 0`.
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if this segment is not a [native](#isNative()) segment.
    :   `IllegalCallerException` - If the caller is in a module that does not have native access enabled.

    [MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment) reinterpret([Arena](Arena.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](Arena.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.Arena) arena,
    [Consumer](../../util/function/Consumer.md "interface in java.util.function")<[MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment)> cleanup)

    Returns a new memory segment with the same address and size as this segment, but with the provided scope.
    As such, the returned segment cannot be accessed after the provided arena has been closed.
    Moreover, the returned segment can be accessed compatibly with the confinement restrictions associated with the
    provided arena: that is, if the provided arena is a [confined arena](Arena.md#ofConfined())[PREVIEW](Arena.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.Arena),
    the returned segment can only be accessed by the arena's owner thread, regardless of the confinement restrictions
    associated with this segment. In other words, this method returns a segment that behaves as if it had been allocated
    using the provided arena.

    Clients can specify an optional cleanup action that should be executed when the provided scope becomes
    invalid. This cleanup action receives a fresh memory segment that is obtained from this segment as follows:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

    ```
    MemorySegment cleanupSegment = MemorySegment.ofAddress(this.address())
                                                .reinterpret(byteSize());
    ```

    That is, the cleanup action receives a segment that is associated with a fresh scope that is always alive,
    and is accessible from any thread. The size of the segment accepted by the cleanup action is [`byteSize()`](#byteSize()).

    This method is [*restricted*](package-summary.md#restricted).
    Restricted methods are unsafe, and, if used incorrectly, their use might crash
    the JVM or, worse, silently result in memory corruption. Thus, clients should refrain from depending on
    restricted methods, and use safe and supported functionalities, where possible.

    Parameters:
    :   `arena` - the arena to be associated with the returned segment.
    :   `cleanup` - the cleanup action that should be executed when the provided arena is closed (can be `null`).

    Returns:
    :   a new memory segment with unbounded size.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if `arena.scope().isAlive() == false`.
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if this segment is not a [native](#isNative()) segment.
    :   `IllegalCallerException` - If the caller is in a module that does not have native access enabled.

    [MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment) reinterpret(long newSize,
    [Arena](Arena.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](Arena.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.Arena) arena,
    [Consumer](../../util/function/Consumer.md "interface in java.util.function")<[MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment)> cleanup)

    Returns a new segment with the same address as this segment, but with the provided size and scope.
    As such, the returned segment cannot be accessed after the provided arena has been closed.
    Moreover, if the returned segment can be accessed compatibly with the confinement restrictions associated with the
    provided arena: that is, if the provided arena is a [confined arena](Arena.md#ofConfined())[PREVIEW](Arena.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.Arena),
    the returned segment can only be accessed by the arena's owner thread, regardless of the confinement restrictions
    associated with this segment. In other words, this method returns a segment that behaves as if it had been allocated
    using the provided arena.

    Clients can specify an optional cleanup action that should be executed when the provided scope becomes
    invalid. This cleanup action receives a fresh memory segment that is obtained from this segment as follows:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

    ```
    MemorySegment cleanupSegment = MemorySegment.ofAddress(this.address())
                                                .reinterpret(newSize);
    ```

    That is, the cleanup action receives a segment that is associated with a fresh scope that is always alive,
    and is accessible from any thread. The size of the segment accepted by the cleanup action is `newSize`.

    This method is [*restricted*](package-summary.md#restricted).
    Restricted methods are unsafe, and, if used incorrectly, their use might crash
    the JVM or, worse, silently result in memory corruption. Thus, clients should refrain from depending on
    restricted methods, and use safe and supported functionalities, where possible.

    Parameters:
    :   `newSize` - the size of the returned segment.
    :   `arena` - the arena to be associated with the returned segment.
    :   `cleanup` - the cleanup action that should be executed when the provided arena is closed (can be `null`).

    Returns:
    :   a new segment that has the same address as this segment, but with new size and its scope set to
        that of the provided arena.

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if this segment is not a [native](#isNative()) segment.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `newSize < 0`.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if `arena.scope().isAlive() == false`.
    :   `IllegalCallerException` - If the caller is in a module that does not have native access enabled.
  + ### isReadOnly

    boolean isReadOnly()

    Returns `true`, if this segment is read-only.

    Returns:
    :   `true`, if this segment is read-only

    See Also:
    :   - [`asReadOnly()`](#asReadOnly())
  + ### asReadOnly

    [MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment) asReadOnly()

    Returns a read-only view of this segment. The resulting segment will be identical to this one, but
    attempts to overwrite the contents of the returned segment will cause runtime exceptions.

    Returns:
    :   a read-only view of this segment

    See Also:
    :   - [`isReadOnly()`](#isReadOnly())
  + ### isNative

    boolean isNative()

    Returns `true` if this segment is a native segment. A native segment is
    created e.g. using the [`Arena.allocate(long, long)`](Arena.md#allocate(long,long))[PREVIEW](Arena.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.Arena) (and related) factory, or by
    [wrapping](#ofBuffer(java.nio.Buffer)) a [direct buffer](../../nio/ByteBuffer.md#allocateDirect(int)).

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this segment is native segment.
  + ### isMapped

    boolean isMapped()

    Returns `true` if this segment is a mapped segment. A mapped memory segment is created e.g. using the
    [`FileChannel.map(FileChannel.MapMode, long, long, Arena)`](../../nio/channels/FileChannel.md#map(java.nio.channels.FileChannel.MapMode,long,long,java.lang.foreign.Arena))[PREVIEW](../../nio/channels/FileChannel.md#preview-map(java.nio.channels.FileChannel.MapMode,long,long,java.lang.foreign.Arena)) factory, or by
    [wrapping](#ofBuffer(java.nio.Buffer)) a [mapped byte buffer](../../nio/MappedByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio").

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this segment is a mapped segment.
  + ### asOverlappingSlice

    [Optional](../../util/Optional.md "class in java.util")<[MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment)> asOverlappingSlice([MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment) other)

    Returns a slice of this segment that is the overlap between this and
    the provided segment.

    Two segments `S1` and `S2` are said to overlap if it is possible to find
    at least two slices `L1` (from `S1`) and `L2` (from `S2`) that are backed by the
    same region of memory. As such, it is not possible for a
    [native](#isNative()) segment to overlap with a heap segment; in
    this case, or when no overlap occurs, an empty `Optional` is returned.

    Parameters:
    :   `other` - the segment to test for an overlap with this segment.

    Returns:
    :   a slice of this segment (where overlapping occurs).
  + ### segmentOffset

    long segmentOffset([MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment) other)

    Returns the offset, in bytes, of the provided segment, relative to this
    segment.

    The offset is relative to the address of this segment and can be
    a negative or positive value. For instance, if both segments are native
    segments, or heap segments backed by the same array, the resulting offset
    can be computed as follows:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

    ```
    other.address() - address()
    ```

    If the segments share the same address, `0` is returned. If
    `other` is a slice of this segment, the offset is always
    `0 <= x < this.byteSize()`.

    Parameters:
    :   `other` - the segment to retrieve an offset to.

    Returns:
    :   the relative offset, in bytes, of the provided segment.

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the two segments cannot be compared, e.g. because they are of
        different kinds, or because they are backed by different Java arrays.
  + ### fill

    [MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment) fill(byte value)

    Fills the contents of this memory segment with the given value.

    More specifically, the given value is written into each address of this
    segment. Equivalent to (but likely more efficient than) the following code:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

    ```
    for (long offset = 0; offset < segment.byteSize(); offset++) {
        byteHandle.set(ValueLayout.JAVA_BYTE, offset, value);
    }
    ```

    But without any regard or guarantees on the ordering of particular memory
    elements being set.

    This method can be useful to initialize or reset the contents of a memory segment.

    Parameters:
    :   `value` - the value to write into this segment.

    Returns:
    :   this memory segment.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with this segment is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if this segment is [read-only](#isReadOnly()).
  + ### copyFrom

    default [MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment) copyFrom([MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment) src)

    Performs a bulk copy from given source segment to this segment. More specifically, the bytes at
    offset `0` through `src.byteSize() - 1` in the source segment are copied into this segment
    at offset `0` through `src.byteSize() - 1`.

    Calling this method is equivalent to the following code:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

    ```
    MemorySegment.copy(src, 0, this, 0, src.byteSize());
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `src` - the source segment.

    Returns:
    :   this segment.

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if `src.byteSize() > this.byteSize()`.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with this segment is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with `src` is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `src.isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if this segment is [read-only](#isReadOnly()).
  + ### mismatch

    default long mismatch([MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment) other)

    Finds and returns the offset, in bytes, of the first mismatch between
    this segment and the given other segment. The offset is relative to the
    [address](#address()) of each segment and will be in the
    range of 0 (inclusive) up to the [size](#byteSize()) (in bytes) of
    the smaller memory segment (exclusive).

    If the two segments share a common prefix then the returned offset is
    the length of the common prefix, and it follows that there is a mismatch
    between the two segments at that offset within the respective segments.
    If one segment is a proper prefix of the other, then the returned offset is
    the smallest of the segment sizes, and it follows that the offset is only
    valid for the larger segment. Otherwise, there is no mismatch and `-1` is returned.

    Parameters:
    :   `other` - the segment to be tested for a mismatch with this segment.

    Returns:
    :   the relative offset, in bytes, of the first mismatch between this
        and the given other segment, otherwise -1 if no mismatch.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with this segment is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with `other` is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `other.isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
  + ### isLoaded

    boolean isLoaded()

    Determines whether the contents of this mapped segment is resident in physical
    memory.

    A return value of `true` implies that it is highly likely
    that all the data in this segment is resident in physical memory and
    may therefore be accessed without incurring any virtual-memory page
    faults or I/O operations. A return value of `false` does not
    necessarily imply that this segment's content is not resident in physical
    memory.

    The returned value is a hint, rather than a guarantee, because the
    underlying operating system may have paged out some of this segment's data
    by the time that an invocation of this method returns.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if it is likely that the contents of this segment
        is resident in physical memory

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with this segment is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if this segment is not a mapped memory segment, e.g. if
        `isMapped() == false`.
  + ### load

    void load()

    Loads the contents of this mapped segment into physical memory.

    This method makes a best effort to ensure that, when it returns,
    this contents of this segment is resident in physical memory. Invoking this
    method may cause some number of page faults and I/O operations to
    occur.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with this segment is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if this segment is not a mapped memory segment, e.g. if
        `isMapped() == false`.
  + ### unload

    void unload()

    Unloads the contents of this mapped segment from physical memory.

    This method makes a best effort to ensure that the contents of this segment are
    are no longer resident in physical memory. Accessing this segment's contents
    after invoking this method may cause some number of page faults and I/O operations to
    occur (as this segment's contents might need to be paged back in).

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with this segment is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if this segment is not a mapped memory segment, e.g. if
        `isMapped() == false`.
  + ### force

    void force()

    Forces any changes made to the contents of this mapped segment to be written to the
    storage device described by the mapped segment's file descriptor.

    If the file descriptor associated with this mapped segment resides on a local storage
    device then when this method returns it is guaranteed that all changes
    made to this segment since it was created, or since this method was last
    invoked, will have been written to that device.

    If the file descriptor associated with this mapped segment does not reside on a local device then
    no such guarantee is made.

    If this segment was not mapped in read/write mode ([`FileChannel.MapMode.READ_WRITE`](../../nio/channels/FileChannel.MapMode.md#READ_WRITE)) then
    invoking this method may have no effect. In particular, the
    method has no effect for segments mapped in read-only or private
    mapping modes. This method may or may not have an effect for
    implementation-specific mapping modes.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with this segment is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if this segment is not a mapped memory segment, e.g. if
        `isMapped() == false`.
    :   `UncheckedIOException` - if there is an I/O error writing the contents of this segment to the associated storage device
  + ### asByteBuffer

    [ByteBuffer](../../nio/ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") asByteBuffer()

    Wraps this segment in a [`ByteBuffer`](../../nio/ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio"). Some properties of the returned buffer are linked to
    the properties of this segment. More specifically, the resulting buffer has the following characteristics:
    - It is [read-only](../../nio/Buffer.md#isReadOnly()), if this segment is a
      [read-only segment](#isReadOnly());
    - Its [position](../../nio/Buffer.md#position()) is set to zero;- Its [capacity](../../nio/Buffer.md#capacity()) and [limit](../../nio/Buffer.md#limit())
        are both set to this segment' [size](#byteSize()). For this reason, a byte buffer
        cannot be returned if this segment's size is greater than [`Integer.MAX_VALUE`](../Integer.md#MAX_VALUE);
      - It is a [direct buffer](../../nio/ByteBuffer.md#isDirect()), if this is a native segment.

    The life-cycle of the returned buffer is tied to that of this segment. That is, accessing the returned buffer
    after the scope associated with this segment is no longer [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope), will
    throw an [`IllegalStateException`](../IllegalStateException.md "class in java.lang"). Similarly, accessing the returned buffer from a thread `T`
    such that `isAccessible(T) == false` will throw a [`WrongThreadException`](../WrongThreadException.md "class in java.lang").

    If this segment is [accessible](#isAccessibleBy(java.lang.Thread)) from a single thread, calling read/write I/O
    operations on the resulting buffer might result in unspecified exceptions being thrown. Examples of such problematic operations are
    [`AsynchronousSocketChannel.read(ByteBuffer)`](../../nio/channels/AsynchronousSocketChannel.md#read(java.nio.ByteBuffer)) and
    [`AsynchronousSocketChannel.write(ByteBuffer)`](../../nio/channels/AsynchronousSocketChannel.md#write(java.nio.ByteBuffer)).

    Finally, the resulting buffer's byte order is [`ByteOrder.BIG_ENDIAN`](../../nio/ByteOrder.md#BIG_ENDIAN); this can be changed using
    [`ByteBuffer.order(java.nio.ByteOrder)`](../../nio/ByteBuffer.md#order(java.nio.ByteOrder)).

    Returns:
    :   a [`ByteBuffer`](../../nio/ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") view of this memory segment.

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if this segment cannot be mapped onto a [`ByteBuffer`](../../nio/ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") instance,
        e.g. if it is a heap segment backed by an array other than `byte[]`), or if its size is greater
        than [`Integer.MAX_VALUE`](../Integer.md#MAX_VALUE).
  + ### toArray

    byte[] toArray([ValueLayout.OfByte](ValueLayout.OfByte.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](ValueLayout.OfByte.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout.OfByte) elementLayout)

    Copy the contents of this memory segment into a new byte array.

    Parameters:
    :   `elementLayout` - the source element layout. If the byte order associated with the layout is

    Returns:
    :   a new byte array whose contents are copied from this memory segment.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with this segment is not

    :   `IllegalStateException` - if this segment's contents cannot be copied into a `byte[]` instance,
        e.g. its size is greater than [`Integer.MAX_VALUE`](../Integer.md#MAX_VALUE).
  + ### toArray

    short[] toArray([ValueLayout.OfShort](ValueLayout.OfShort.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](ValueLayout.OfShort.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout.OfShort) elementLayout)

    Copy the contents of this memory segment into a new short array.

    Parameters:
    :   `elementLayout` - the source element layout. If the byte order associated with the layout is
        different from the [native order](../../nio/ByteOrder.md#nativeOrder()), a byte swap operation will be performed on each array element.

    Copy the contents of this memory segment into a new char array.

    Parameters:
    :   `elementLayout` - the source element layout. If the byte order associated with the layout is
        different from the [native order](../../nio/ByteOrder.md#nativeOrder()), a byte swap operation will be performed on each array element.

    Returns:
    :   a new char array whose contents are copied from this memory segment.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with this segment is not

    Copy the contents of this memory segment into a new int array.

    Parameters:
    :   `elementLayout` - the source element layout. If the byte order associated with the layout is
        different from the [native order](../../nio/ByteOrder.md#nativeOrder()), a byte swap operation will be performed on each array element.

    Returns:
    :   a new int array whose contents are copied from this memory segment.

    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if this segment's contents cannot be copied into a `int[]` instance,
        e.g. because `byteSize() % 4 != 0`, or `byteSize() / 4 > Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
  + ### toArray

    float[] toArray([ValueLayout.OfFloat](ValueLayout.OfFloat.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](ValueLayout.OfFloat.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout.OfFloat) elementLayout)

    Copy the contents of this memory segment into a new float array.

    Parameters:
    :   `elementLayout` - the source element layout. If the byte order associated with the layout is
        different from the [native order](../../nio/ByteOrder.md#nativeOrder()), a byte swap operation will be performed on each array element.

    Copy the contents of this memory segment into a new long array.

    Parameters:
    :   `elementLayout` - the source element layout. If the byte order associated with the layout is
        different from the [native order](../../nio/ByteOrder.md#nativeOrder()), a byte swap operation will be performed on each array element.

    Returns:
    :   a new long array whose contents are copied from this memory segment.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with this segment is not

  + ### toArray

    double[] toArray([ValueLayout.OfDouble](ValueLayout.OfDouble.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](ValueLayout.OfDouble.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout.OfDouble) elementLayout)

    Copy the contents of this memory segment into a new double array.

    Parameters:
    :   `elementLayout` - the source element layout. If the byte order associated with the layout is
        different from the [native order](../../nio/ByteOrder.md#nativeOrder()), a byte swap operation will be performed on each array element.

    Returns:
    :   a new double array whose contents are copied from this memory segment.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with this segment is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if this segment's contents cannot be copied into a `double[]` instance,
        e.g. because `byteSize() % 8 != 0`, or `byteSize() / 8 > Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
  + ### getUtf8String

    default [String](../String.md "class in java.lang") getUtf8String(long offset)

    Reads a UTF-8 encoded, null-terminated string from this segment at the given offset.

    This method always replaces malformed-input and unmappable-character
    sequences with this charset's default replacement string. The [`CharsetDecoder`](../../nio/charset/CharsetDecoder.md "class in java.nio.charset") class should be used when more control
    over the decoding process is required.

    Parameters:
    :   `offset` - offset in bytes (relative to this segment address) at which this access operation will occur.

    Returns:
    :   a Java string constructed from the bytes read from the given starting address up to (but not including)
        the first `'\0'` terminator character (assuming one is found).

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the size of the UTF-8 string is greater than the largest string supported by the platform.
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if `offset < 0` or `offset > byteSize() - S`, where `S` is the size of the UTF-8
        string (including the terminator character).
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with this segment is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
  + ### setUtf8String

    default void setUtf8String(long offset,
    [String](../String.md "class in java.lang") str)

    Writes the given string into this segment at the given offset, converting it to a null-terminated byte sequence using UTF-8 encoding.

    This method always replaces malformed-input and unmappable-character
    sequences with this charset's default replacement string. The [`CharsetDecoder`](../../nio/charset/CharsetDecoder.md "class in java.nio.charset") class should be used when more control
    over the decoding process is required.

    If the given string contains any `'\0'` characters, they will be
    copied as well. This means that, depending on the method used to read
    the string, such as [`getUtf8String(long)`](#getUtf8String(long)), the string
    will appear truncated when read again.

    Parameters:
    :   `offset` - offset in bytes (relative to this segment address) at which this access operation will occur.
        the final address of this write operation can be expressed as `address() + offset`.
    :   `str` - the Java string to be written into this segment.

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if `offset < 0` or `offset > byteSize() - str.getBytes().length() + 1`.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with this segment is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
  + ### ofBuffer

    static [MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment) ofBuffer([Buffer](../../nio/Buffer.md "class in java.nio") buffer)

    Creates a memory segment that is backed by the same region of memory that backs the given [`Buffer`](../../nio/Buffer.md "class in java.nio") instance.
    The segment starts relative to the buffer's position (inclusive) and ends relative to the buffer's limit (exclusive).

    If the buffer is [read-only](../../nio/Buffer.md#isReadOnly()), the resulting segment is also
    [read-only](../../nio/Buffer.md#isReadOnly()). Moreover, if the buffer is a [direct buffer](../../nio/Buffer.md#isDirect()),
    the returned segment is a native segment; otherwise the returned memory segment is a heap segment.

    If the provided buffer has been obtained by calling [`asByteBuffer()`](#asByteBuffer()) on a memory segment whose
    [scope](MemorySegment.Scope.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope) is `S`, the returned segment will be associated with the
    same scope `S`. Otherwise, the scope of the returned segment is a fresh scope that is always alive.

    The scope associated with the returned segment keeps the provided buffer reachable. As such, if
    the provided buffer is a direct buffer, its backing memory region will not be deallocated as long as the
    returned segment (or any of its slices) are kept reachable.

    Parameters:
    :   `buffer` - the buffer instance to be turned into a new memory segment.

    Returns:
    :   a memory segment, derived from the given buffer instance.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the provided `buffer` is a heap buffer but is not backed by an array.
        For example, buffers directly or indirectly obtained via
        ([`CharBuffer.wrap(CharSequence)`](../../nio/CharBuffer.md#wrap(java.lang.CharSequence)) or [`CharBuffer.wrap(char[], int, int)`](../../nio/CharBuffer.md#wrap(char%5B%5D,int,int))

  + ### copy

    static void copy([MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment) srcSegment,
    long srcOffset,
    [MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment) dstSegment,
    long dstOffset,
    long bytes)

    Performs a bulk copy from source segment to destination segment. More specifically, the bytes at offset
    `srcOffset` through `srcOffset + bytes - 1` in the source segment are copied into the destination
    segment at offset `dstOffset` through `dstOffset + bytes - 1`.

    If the source segment overlaps with the destination segment, then the copying is performed as if the bytes at
    offset `srcOffset` through `srcOffset + bytes - 1` in the source segment were first copied into a
    temporary segment with size `bytes`, and then the contents of the temporary segment were copied into
    the destination segment at offset `dstOffset` through `dstOffset + bytes - 1`.

    The result of a bulk copy is unspecified if, in the uncommon case, the source segment and the destination segment
    do not overlap, but refer to overlapping regions of the same backing storage using different addresses.
    For example, this may occur if the same file is [mapped](../../nio/channels/FileChannel.md#map(java.nio.channels.FileChannel.MapMode,long,long)) to two segments.

    Calling this method is equivalent to the following code:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

    ```
    MemorySegment.copy(srcSegment, ValueLayout.JAVA_BYTE, srcOffset, dstSegment, ValueLayout.JAVA_BYTE, dstOffset, bytes);
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `srcSegment` - the source segment.
    :   `srcOffset` - the starting offset, in bytes, of the source segment.
    :   `dstSegment` - the destination segment.
    :   `dstOffset` - the starting offset, in bytes, of the destination segment.
    :   `bytes` - the number of bytes to be copied.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with `srcSegment` is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `srcSegment.isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with `dstSegment` is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `dstSegment.isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if `srcOffset > srcSegment.byteSize() - bytes` or if
        `dstOffset > dstSegment.byteSize() - bytes`, or if either `srcOffset`, `dstOffset`
        or `bytes` are `< 0`.
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if `dstSegment` is [read-only](#isReadOnly()).
  + ### copy

    static void copy([MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment) srcSegment,
    [ValueLayout](ValueLayout.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](ValueLayout.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout) srcElementLayout,
    long srcOffset,
    [MemorySegment](MemorySegment.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment) dstSegment,
    [ValueLayout](ValueLayout.md "interface in java.lang.foreign")[PREVIEW](ValueLayout.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.ValueLayout) dstElementLayout,
    long dstOffset,
    long elementCount)

    Performs a bulk copy from source segment to destination segment. More specifically, if `S` is the byte size
    of the element layouts, the bytes at offset `srcOffset` through `srcOffset + (elementCount * S) - 1`
    in the source segment are copied into the destination segment at offset `dstOffset` through `dstOffset + (elementCount * S) - 1`.

    The copy occurs in an element-wise fashion: the bytes in the source segment are interpreted as a sequence of elements
    whose layout is `srcElementLayout`, whereas the bytes in the destination segment are interpreted as a sequence of
    elements whose layout is `dstElementLayout`. Both element layouts must have same size `S`.
    If the byte order of the two element layouts differ, the bytes corresponding to each element to be copied
    are swapped accordingly during the copy operation.

    If the source segment overlaps with the destination segment, then the copying is performed as if the bytes at
    offset `srcOffset` through `srcOffset + (elementCount * S) - 1` in the source segment were first copied into a
    temporary segment with size `bytes`, and then the contents of the temporary segment were copied into
    the destination segment at offset `dstOffset` through `dstOffset + (elementCount * S) - 1`.

    The result of a bulk copy is unspecified if, in the uncommon case, the source segment and the destination segment
    do not overlap, but refer to overlapping regions of the same backing storage using different addresses.
    For example, this may occur if the same file is [mapped](../../nio/channels/FileChannel.md#map(java.nio.channels.FileChannel.MapMode,long,long)) to two segments.

    Parameters:
    :   `srcSegment` - the source segment.
    :   `srcElementLayout` - the element layout associated with the source segment.
    :   `srcOffset` - the starting offset, in bytes, of the source segment.
    :   `dstSegment` - the destination segment.
    :   `dstElementLayout` - the element layout associated with the destination segment.
    :   `dstOffset` - the starting offset, in bytes, of the destination segment.
    :   `elementCount` - the number of elements to be copied.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the element layouts have different sizes, if the source (resp. destination) segment/offset are
        [incompatible with the alignment constraint](MemorySegment.md#segment-alignment) in the source
        (resp. destination) element layout, or if the source (resp. destination) element layout alignment is greater than its size.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with `srcSegment` is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `srcSegment().isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with `dstSegment` is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `dstSegment().isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if `dstSegment` is [read-only](#isReadOnly()).
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if `elementCount * srcLayout.byteSize()` or `elementCount * dtsLayout.byteSize()` overflows.
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if `dstOffset > dstSegment.byteSize() - (elementCount * dstLayout.byteSize())`.
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if either `srcOffset`, `dstOffset` or `elementCount` are `< 0`.

  + ### equals

    boolean equals([Object](../Object.md "class in java.lang") that)

    Compares the specified object with this memory segment for equality. Returns `true` if and only if the specified
    object is also a memory segment, and if the two segments refer to the same location, in some region of memory.
    More specifically, for two segments `s1` and `s2` to be considered equals, all the following must be true:
    - `s1.heapBase().equals(s2.heapBase())`, that is, the two segments must be of the same kind;
      either both are [native segments](#isNative()), backed by off-heap memory, or both are backed by
      the same on-heap [Java object](#heapBase());- `s1.address() == s2.address()`, that is, the address of the two segments should be the same.
        This means that the two segments either refer to the same location in some off-heap region, or they refer
        to the same offset inside their associated [Java object](#heapBase()).

    Overrides:
    :   `equals` in class `Object`

    Parameters:
    :   `that` - the object to be compared for equality with this memory segment.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the specified object is equal to this memory segment.

    Finds and returns the relative offset, in bytes, of the first mismatch between the source and the destination

    If the two segments, over the specified ranges, share a common prefix then the returned offset is the length
    of the common prefix, and it follows that there is a mismatch between the two segments at that relative offset
    within the respective segments. If one segment is a proper prefix of the other, over the specified ranges,
    then the returned offset is the smallest range, and it follows that the relative offset is only
    valid for the segment with the larger range. Otherwise, there is no mismatch and `-1` is returned.

    Parameters:
    :   `srcSegment` - the source segment.
    :   `srcFromOffset` - the offset (inclusive) of the first byte in the source segment to be tested.
    :   `srcToOffset` - the offset (exclusive) of the last byte in the source segment to be tested.
    :   `dstSegment` - the destination segment.
    :   `dstFromOffset` - the offset (inclusive) of the first byte in the destination segment to be tested.
    :   `dstToOffset` - the offset (exclusive) of the last byte in the destination segment to be tested.

    Returns:
    :   the relative offset, in bytes, of the first mismatch between the source and destination segments,
        otherwise -1 if no mismatch.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with `srcSegment` is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `srcSegment.isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the [scope](#scope()) associated with `dstSegment` is not
        [alive](MemorySegment.Scope.md#isAlive())[PREVIEW](MemorySegment.Scope.md#preview-java.lang.foreign.MemorySegment.Scope).
    :   `WrongThreadException` - if this method is called from a thread `T`,
        such that `dstSegment.isAccessibleBy(T) == false`.
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if `srcFromOffset < 0`, `srcToOffset < srcFromOffset` or
        `srcToOffset > srcSegment.byteSize()`
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if `dstFromOffset < 0`, `dstToOffset < dstFromOffset` or
        `dstToOffset > dstSegment.byteSize()`
