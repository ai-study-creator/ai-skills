public interface AnnotatedElement

Represents an annotated construct of the program currently running
in this VM.
A construct is either an element or a type. Annotations on an
element are on a *declaration*, whereas annotations on a
type are on a specific *use* of a type name.
As defined by The Java Language Specification
section , an annotation on an element is a
*declaration annotation* and an annotation on a type is a
*type annotation*.
Note that any annotations returned by methods on the [`AnnotatedType`](AnnotatedType.md "interface in java.lang.reflect") interface and its subinterfaces are
type annotations as the entity being potentially annotated is a
type. Annotations returned by methods outside of the `AnnotatedType` hierarchy are declaration annotations.

This interface allows annotations to be read reflectively. All
annotations returned by methods in this interface are immutable and
serializable. The arrays returned by methods of this interface may
be modified by callers without affecting the arrays returned to
other callers.

The [`getAnnotationsByType(Class)`](#getAnnotationsByType(java.lang.Class)) and [`getDeclaredAnnotationsByType(Class)`](#getDeclaredAnnotationsByType(java.lang.Class)) methods support multiple
annotations of the same type on an element. If the argument to
either method is a repeatable annotation type (JLS ),
then the method will "look through" a container annotation (JLS
), if present, and return any annotations inside the
container. Container annotations may be generated at compile-time
to wrap multiple annotations of the argument type.

The terms *directly present*, *indirectly present*,
*present*, and *associated* are used throughout this
interface to describe precisely which annotations are returned by
methods:

* An annotation *A* is *directly present* on an
  element *E* if *E* has a `RuntimeVisibleAnnotations` or `RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations` or `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations` attribute, and the attribute
  contains *A*.* An annotation *A* is *indirectly present* on an
    element *E* if *E* has a `RuntimeVisibleAnnotations` or
    `RuntimeVisibleParameterAnnotations` or `RuntimeVisibleTypeAnnotations`
    attribute, and *A* 's type is repeatable, and the attribute contains
    exactly one annotation whose value element contains *A* and whose
    type is the containing annotation type of *A* 's type.* An annotation *A* is *present* on an element *E* if either:
      + *A* is directly present on *E*; or+ No annotation of *A* 's type is directly present on
          *E*, and *E* is a class, and *A* 's type is
          inheritable, and *A* is present on the superclass of *E*.* An annotation *A* is *associated* with an element *E*
        if either:
        + *A* is directly or indirectly present on *E*; or+ No annotation of *A* 's type is directly or indirectly
            present on *E*, and *E* is a class, and *A*'s type
            is inheritable, and *A* is associated with the superclass of
            *E*.

The table below summarizes which kind of annotation presence
different methods in this interface examine.

Overview of kind of presence detected by different AnnotatedElement methods

| Method | | Kind of Presence | | | || Return Type | Signature | Directly Present | Indirectly Present | Present | Associated |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `T` | [`getAnnotation(Class<T>)`](#getAnnotation(java.lang.Class))  |  | X |  | |
| `Annotation[]` | [`getAnnotations()`](#getAnnotations())  |  | X |  | |
| `T[]` | [`getAnnotationsByType(Class<T>)`](#getAnnotationsByType(java.lang.Class))  |  |  | X | |
| `T` | [`getDeclaredAnnotation(Class<T>)`](#getDeclaredAnnotation(java.lang.Class)) X |  |  |  | |
| `Annotation[]` | [`getDeclaredAnnotations()`](#getDeclaredAnnotations()) X |  |  |  | |
| `T[]` | [`getDeclaredAnnotationsByType(Class<T>)`](#getDeclaredAnnotationsByType(java.lang.Class)) X | X |  |  | |

For an invocation of `get[Declared]AnnotationsByType(Class <T>)`,
the order of annotations which are directly or indirectly
present on an element *E* is computed as if indirectly present
annotations on *E* are directly present on *E* in place
of their container annotation, in the order in which they appear in
the value element of the container annotation.

There are several compatibility concerns to keep in mind if an
annotation type *T* is originally *not* repeatable and
later modified to be repeatable.
The containing annotation type for *T* is *TC*.

* Modifying *T* to be repeatable is source and binary
  compatible with existing uses of *T* and with existing uses
  of *TC*.
  That is, for source compatibility, source code with annotations of
  type *T* or of type *TC* will still compile. For binary
  compatibility, class files with annotations of type *T* or of
  type *TC* (or with other kinds of uses of type *T* or of
  type *TC*) will link against the modified version of *T*
  if they linked against the earlier version.
  (An annotation type *TC* may informally serve as an acting
  containing annotation type before *T* is modified to be
  formally repeatable. Alternatively, when *T* is made
  repeatable, *TC* can be introduced as a new type.)* If an annotation type *TC* is present on an element, and
    *T* is modified to be repeatable with *TC* as its
    containing annotation type then:
    + The change to *T* is behaviorally compatible with respect
      to the `get[Declared]Annotation(Class<T>)` (called with an
      argument of *T* or *TC*) and `get[Declared]Annotations()` methods because the results of the
      methods will not change due to *TC* becoming the containing
      annotation type for *T*.+ The change to *T* changes the results of the `get[Declared]AnnotationsByType(Class<T>)` methods called with an
        argument of *T*, because those methods will now recognize an
        annotation of type *TC* as a container annotation for *T*
        and will "look through" it to expose annotations of type *T*.* If an annotation of type *T* is present on an
      element and *T* is made repeatable and more annotations of
      type *T* are added to the element:
      + The addition of the annotations of type *T* is both
        source compatible and binary compatible.+ The addition of the annotations of type *T* changes the results
          of the `get[Declared]Annotation(Class<T>)` methods and `get[Declared]Annotations()` methods, because those methods will now
          only see a container annotation on the element and not see an
          annotation of type *T*.+ The addition of the annotations of type *T* changes the
            results of the `get[Declared]AnnotationsByType(Class<T>)`
            methods, because their results will expose the additional
            annotations of type *T* whereas previously they exposed only a
            single annotation of type *T*.

If an annotation returned by a method in this interface contains
(directly or indirectly) a [`Class`](../Class.md "class in java.lang")-valued member referring to
a class that is not accessible in this VM, attempting to read the class
by calling the relevant Class-returning method on the returned annotation
will result in a [`TypeNotPresentException`](../TypeNotPresentException.md "class in java.lang").

Similarly, attempting to read an enum-valued member will result in
a [`EnumConstantNotPresentException`](../EnumConstantNotPresentException.md "class in java.lang") if the enum constant in the
annotation is no longer present in the enum class.

If an annotation type *T* is (meta-)annotated with an
`@Repeatable` annotation whose value element indicates a type
*TC*, but *TC* does not declare a `value()` method
with a return type of *T*`[]`, then an exception of type
[`AnnotationFormatError`](../annotation/AnnotationFormatError.md "class in java.lang.annotation") is thrown.

Finally, attempting to read a member whose definition has evolved
incompatibly will result in a [`AnnotationTypeMismatchException`](../annotation/AnnotationTypeMismatchException.md "class in java.lang.annotation") or an
[`IncompleteAnnotationException`](../annotation/IncompleteAnnotationException.md "class in java.lang.annotation").

* ## Method Details

  + ### isAnnotationPresent

    default boolean isAnnotationPresent([Class](../Class.md "class in java.lang")<? extends [Annotation](../annotation/Annotation.md "interface in java.lang.annotation")> annotationClass)

    Returns true if an annotation for the specified type
    is *present* on this element, else false. This method
    is designed primarily for convenient access to marker annotations.

    The truth value returned by this method is equivalent to:
    `getAnnotation(annotationClass) != null`

    Parameters:
    :   `annotationClass` - the Class object corresponding to the
        annotation type

    Returns:
    :   true if an annotation for the specified annotation
        type is present on this element, else false

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the given annotation class is null

    Since:
    :   1.5
  + ### getAnnotation

    <T extends [Annotation](../annotation/Annotation.md "interface in java.lang.annotation")> T getAnnotation([Class](../Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> annotationClass)

    Returns this element's annotation for the specified type if
    such an annotation is *present*, else null.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the annotation to query for and return if present

    Parameters:
    :   `annotationClass` - the Class object corresponding to the
        annotation type

    Returns:
    :   this element's annotation for the specified annotation type if
        present on this element, else null

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the given annotation class is null

    Since:
    :   1.5
  + ### getAnnotations

    [Annotation](../annotation/Annotation.md "interface in java.lang.annotation")[] getAnnotations()

    Returns annotations that are *present* on this element.
    If there are no annotations *present* on this element, the return
    value is an array of length 0.
    The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will
    have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.

    Returns:
    :   annotations present on this element

    Since:
    :   1.5
  + ### getAnnotationsByType

    default <T extends [Annotation](../annotation/Annotation.md "interface in java.lang.annotation")> T[] getAnnotationsByType([Class](../Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> annotationClass)

    Returns annotations that are *associated* with this element.
    If there are no annotations *associated* with this element, the return
    value is an array of length 0.
    The difference between this method and [`getAnnotation(Class)`](#getAnnotation(java.lang.Class))
    is that this method detects if its argument is a *repeatable
    annotation type* (JLS ), and if so, attempts to find one or
    more annotations of that type by "looking through" a container
    annotation.
    The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will
    have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the annotation to query for and return if present

    Parameters:
    :   `annotationClass` - the Class object corresponding to the
        annotation type

    Returns:
    :   all this element's annotations for the specified annotation type if
        associated with this element, else an array of length zero

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the given annotation class is null

    Since:
    :   1.8
  + ### getDeclaredAnnotation

    default <T extends [Annotation](../annotation/Annotation.md "interface in java.lang.annotation")> T getDeclaredAnnotation([Class](../Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> annotationClass)

    Returns this element's annotation for the specified type if
    such an annotation is *directly present*, else null.
    This method ignores inherited annotations. (Returns null if no
    annotations are directly present on this element.)

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the annotation to query for and return if directly present

    Parameters:
    :   `annotationClass` - the Class object corresponding to the
        annotation type

    Returns:
    :   this element's annotation for the specified annotation type if
        directly present on this element, else null

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the given annotation class is null

    :   1.8
  + ### getDeclaredAnnotationsByType

    default <T extends [Annotation](../annotation/Annotation.md "interface in java.lang.annotation")> T[] getDeclaredAnnotationsByType([Class](../Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> annotationClass)

    Returns this element's annotation(s) for the specified type if
    such annotations are either *directly present* or
    *indirectly present*. This method ignores inherited
    annotations.
    If there are no specified annotations directly or indirectly
    present on this element, the return value is an array of length
    0.
    The difference between this method and [`getDeclaredAnnotation(Class)`](#getDeclaredAnnotation(java.lang.Class)) is that this method detects if its
    argument is a *repeatable annotation type* (JLS ), and if so,
    attempts to find one or more annotations of that type by "looking
    through" a container annotation if one is present.
    The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will
    have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the annotation to query for and return
        if directly or indirectly present

    Parameters:
    :   `annotationClass` - the Class object corresponding to the
        annotation type

    Returns:
    :   all this element's annotations for the specified annotation type if
        directly or indirectly present on this element, else an array of length zero

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the given annotation class is null

    Since:
    :   1.8
  + ### getDeclaredAnnotations

    [Annotation](../annotation/Annotation.md "interface in java.lang.annotation")[] getDeclaredAnnotations()

    Returns annotations that are *directly present* on this element.
    This method ignores inherited annotations.
    If there are no annotations *directly present* on this element,
    the return value is an array of length 0.
    The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will
    have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.

    Returns:
    :   annotations directly present on this element
