# Class Throwable

[java.lang.Object](Object.md "class in java.lang")

java.lang.Throwable

All Implemented Interfaces:

Direct Known Subclasses:
:   `Error`, `Exception`

---

public class Throwable
extends [Object](Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Serializable](../io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io")

The `Throwable` class is the superclass of all errors and
exceptions in the Java language. Only objects that are instances of this
class (or one of its subclasses) are thrown by the Java Virtual Machine or
can be thrown by the Java `throw` statement. Similarly, only
this class or one of its subclasses can be the argument type in a
`catch` clause.
For the purposes of compile-time checking of exceptions, `Throwable` and any subclass of `Throwable` that is not also a
subclass of either [`RuntimeException`](RuntimeException.md "class in java.lang") or [`Error`](Error.md "class in java.lang") are
regarded as checked exceptions.

Instances of two subclasses, [`Error`](Error.md "class in java.lang") and
[`Exception`](Exception.md "class in java.lang"), are conventionally used to indicate
that exceptional situations have occurred. Typically, these instances
are freshly created in the context of the exceptional situation so
as to include relevant information (such as stack trace data).

A throwable contains a snapshot of the execution stack of its
thread at the time it was created. It can also contain a message
string that gives more information about the error. Over time, a
throwable can [suppress](#addSuppressed(java.lang.Throwable)) other
throwables from being propagated. Finally, the throwable can also
contain a *cause*: another throwable that caused this
throwable to be constructed. The recording of this causal information
is referred to as the *chained exception* facility, as the
cause can, itself, have a cause, and so on, leading to a "chain" of
exceptions, each caused by another.

One reason that a throwable may have a cause is that the class that
throws it is built atop a lower layered abstraction, and an operation on
the upper layer fails due to a failure in the lower layer. It would be bad
design to let the throwable thrown by the lower layer propagate outward, as
it is generally unrelated to the abstraction provided by the upper layer.
Further, doing so would tie the API of the upper layer to the details of
its implementation, assuming the lower layer's exception was a checked
exception. Throwing a "wrapped exception" (i.e., an exception containing a
cause) allows the upper layer to communicate the details of the failure to
its caller without incurring either of these shortcomings. It preserves
the flexibility to change the implementation of the upper layer without
changing its API (in particular, the set of exceptions thrown by its
methods).

A second reason that a throwable may have a cause is that the method
that throws it must conform to a general-purpose interface that does not
permit the method to throw the cause directly. For example, suppose
a persistent collection conforms to the [`Collection`](../util/Collection.md "interface in java.util") interface, and that its persistence is implemented atop
`java.io`. Suppose the internals of the `add` method
can throw an [`IOException`](../io/IOException.md "class in java.io"). The implementation
can communicate the details of the `IOException` to its caller
while conforming to the `Collection` interface by wrapping the
`IOException` in an appropriate unchecked exception. (The
specification for the persistent collection should indicate that it is
capable of throwing such exceptions.)

A cause can be associated with a throwable in two ways: via a
constructor that takes the cause as an argument, or via the
[`initCause(Throwable)`](#initCause(java.lang.Throwable)) method. New throwable classes that
wish to allow causes to be associated with them should provide constructors
that take a cause and delegate (perhaps indirectly) to one of the
`Throwable` constructors that takes a cause.
Because the `initCause` method is public, it allows a cause to be
associated with any throwable, even a "legacy throwable" whose
implementation predates the addition of the exception chaining mechanism to
`Throwable`.

By convention, class `Throwable` and its subclasses have two
constructors, one that takes no arguments and one that takes a
`String` argument that can be used to produce a detail message.
Further, those subclasses that might likely have a cause associated with
them should have two more constructors, one that takes a
`Throwable` (the cause), and one that takes a
`String` (the detail message) and a `Throwable` (the
cause).

* ## Constructor Details

  + ### Throwable

    public Throwable()

    Constructs a new throwable with `null` as its detail message.
    The cause is not initialized, and may subsequently be initialized by a
    call to [`initCause(java.lang.Throwable)`](#initCause(java.lang.Throwable)).

    The [`fillInStackTrace()`](#fillInStackTrace()) method is called to initialize
    the stack trace data in the newly created throwable.
  + ### Throwable

    public Throwable([String](String.md "class in java.lang") message)

    Constructs a new throwable with the specified detail message. The
    cause is not initialized, and may subsequently be initialized by
    a call to [`initCause(java.lang.Throwable)`](#initCause(java.lang.Throwable)).

    The [`fillInStackTrace()`](#fillInStackTrace()) method is called to initialize
    the stack trace data in the newly created throwable.

    Parameters:
    :   `message` - the detail message. The detail message is saved for
        later retrieval by the [`getMessage()`](#getMessage()) method.
  + ### Throwable

    public Throwable([String](String.md "class in java.lang") message,
    [Throwable](Throwable.md "class in java.lang") cause)

    Constructs a new throwable with the specified detail message and
    cause.

    Note that the detail message associated with
    `cause` is *not* automatically incorporated in
    this throwable's detail message.

    The [`fillInStackTrace()`](#fillInStackTrace()) method is called to initialize
    the stack trace data in the newly created throwable.

    Parameters:
    :   `message` - the detail message (which is saved for later retrieval
        by the [`getMessage()`](#getMessage()) method).
    :   `cause` - the cause (which is saved for later retrieval by the
        [`getCause()`](#getCause()) method). (A `null` value is
        permitted, and indicates that the cause is nonexistent or
        unknown.)

    Since:
    :   1.4
  + ### Throwable

    public Throwable([Throwable](Throwable.md "class in java.lang") cause)

    Constructs a new throwable with the specified cause and a detail
    message of `(cause==null ? null : cause.toString())` (which
    typically contains the class and detail message of `cause`).
    This constructor is useful for throwables that are little more than
    wrappers for other throwables (for example, [`PrivilegedActionException`](../security/PrivilegedActionException.md "class in java.security")).

    The [`fillInStackTrace()`](#fillInStackTrace()) method is called to initialize
    the stack trace data in the newly created throwable.

    Parameters:
    :   `cause` - the cause (which is saved for later retrieval by the
        [`getCause()`](#getCause()) method). (A `null` value is
        permitted, and indicates that the cause is nonexistent or
        unknown.)

    Since:
    :   1.4
  + ### Throwable

    protected Throwable([String](String.md "class in java.lang") message,
    [Throwable](Throwable.md "class in java.lang") cause,
    boolean enableSuppression,
    boolean writableStackTrace)

    Constructs a new throwable with the specified detail message,
    cause, [suppression](#addSuppressed(java.lang.Throwable)) enabled or
    disabled, and writable stack trace enabled or disabled. If
    suppression is disabled, [`getSuppressed()`](#getSuppressed()) for this object
    will return a zero-length array and calls to [`addSuppressed(java.lang.Throwable)`](#addSuppressed(java.lang.Throwable)) that would otherwise append an exception to the
    suppressed list will have no effect. If the writable stack
    trace is false, this constructor will not call [`fillInStackTrace()`](#fillInStackTrace()), a `null` will be written to the
    `stackTrace` field, and subsequent calls to `fillInStackTrace` and [`setStackTrace(StackTraceElement[])`](#setStackTrace(java.lang.StackTraceElement%5B%5D)) will not set the stack
    trace. If the writable stack trace is false, [`getStackTrace()`](#getStackTrace()) will return a zero length array.

    Note that the other constructors of `Throwable` treat
    suppression as being enabled and the stack trace as being
    writable. Subclasses of `Throwable` should document any
    conditions under which suppression is disabled and document
    conditions under which the stack trace is not writable.
    Disabling of suppression should only occur in exceptional
    circumstances where special requirements exist, such as a
    virtual machine reusing exception objects under low-memory
    situations. Circumstances where a given exception object is
    repeatedly caught and rethrown, such as to implement control
    flow between two sub-systems, is another situation where
    immutable throwable objects would be appropriate.

    Parameters:
    :   `message` - the detail message.
    :   `cause` - the cause. (A `null` value is permitted,
        and indicates that the cause is nonexistent or unknown.)
    :   `enableSuppression` - whether or not suppression is enabled
    :   `writableStackTrace` - whether or not the stack trace is writable

* ## Method Details

  + ### getMessage

    public [String](String.md "class in java.lang") getMessage()

    Returns the detail message string of this throwable.

    Returns:
    :   the detail message string of this `Throwable` instance
        (which may be `null`).
  + ### getLocalizedMessage

    public [String](String.md "class in java.lang") getLocalizedMessage()

    Creates a localized description of this throwable.
    Subclasses may override this method in order to produce a
    locale-specific message. For subclasses that do not override this
    method, the default implementation returns the same result as
    `getMessage()`.

    Returns:
    :   The localized description of this throwable.

    Since:
    :   1.1
  + ### getCause

    public [Throwable](Throwable.md "class in java.lang") getCause()

    Returns the cause of this throwable or `null` if the
    cause is nonexistent or unknown. (The cause is the throwable that
    caused this throwable to get thrown.)

    This implementation returns the cause that was supplied via one of
    the constructors requiring a `Throwable`, or that was set after
    creation with the [`initCause(Throwable)`](#initCause(java.lang.Throwable)) method. While it is
    typically unnecessary to override this method, a subclass can override
    it to return a cause set by some other means. This is appropriate for
    a "legacy chained throwable" that predates the addition of chained
    exceptions to `Throwable`. Note that it is *not*
    necessary to override any of the `PrintStackTrace` methods,
    all of which invoke the `getCause` method to determine the
    cause of a throwable.

    Returns:
    :   the cause of this throwable or `null` if the
        cause is nonexistent or unknown.

    Since:
    :   1.4
  + ### initCause

    public [Throwable](Throwable.md "class in java.lang") initCause([Throwable](Throwable.md "class in java.lang") cause)

    Initializes the *cause* of this throwable to the specified value.
    (The cause is the throwable that caused this throwable to get thrown.)

    This method can be called at most once. It is generally called from
    within the constructor, or immediately after creating the
    throwable. If this throwable was created
    with [`Throwable(Throwable)`](#%3Cinit%3E(java.lang.Throwable)) or
    [`Throwable(String,Throwable)`](#%3Cinit%3E(java.lang.String,java.lang.Throwable)), this method cannot be called
    even once.

    An example of using this method on a legacy throwable type
    without other support for setting the cause is:

    ```
     try {
         lowLevelOp();
     } catch (LowLevelException le) {
         throw (HighLevelException)
               new HighLevelException().initCause(le); // Legacy constructor
     }
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `cause` - the cause (which is saved for later retrieval by the
        [`getCause()`](#getCause()) method). (A `null` value is
        permitted, and indicates that the cause is nonexistent or
        unknown.)

    Returns:
    :   a reference to this `Throwable` instance.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `cause` is this
        throwable. (A throwable cannot be its own cause.)
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if this throwable was
        created with [`Throwable(Throwable)`](#%3Cinit%3E(java.lang.Throwable)) or
        [`Throwable(String,Throwable)`](#%3Cinit%3E(java.lang.String,java.lang.Throwable)), or this method has already
        been called on this throwable.

    Since:
    :   1.4
  + ### toString

    public [String](String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Returns a short description of this throwable.
    The result is the concatenation of:
    - the [name](Class.md#getName()) of the class of this object- ": " (a colon and a space)- the result of invoking this object's [`getLocalizedMessage()`](#getLocalizedMessage())
          methodIf `getLocalizedMessage` returns `null`, then just
    the class name is returned.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a string representation of this throwable.
  + ### printStackTrace

    public void printStackTrace()

    Prints this throwable and its backtrace to the
    standard error stream. This method prints a stack trace for this
    `Throwable` object on the error output stream that is
    the value of the field `System.err`. The first line of
    output contains the result of the [`toString()`](#toString()) method for
    this object. Remaining lines represent data previously recorded by
    the method [`fillInStackTrace()`](#fillInStackTrace()). The format of this
    information depends on the implementation, but the following
    example may be regarded as typical:
    > ```
    >  java.lang.NullPointerException
    >          at MyClass.mash(MyClass.java:9)
    >          at MyClass.crunch(MyClass.java:6)
    >          at MyClass.main(MyClass.java:3)
    > ```

    This example was produced by running the program:

    ```
     class MyClass {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             crunch(null);
         }
         static void crunch(int[] a) {
             mash(a);
         }
         static void mash(int[] b) {
             System.out.println(b[0]);
         }
     }
    ```

    The backtrace for a throwable with an initialized, non-null cause
    should generally include the backtrace for the cause. The format
    of this information depends on the implementation, but the following
    example may be regarded as typical:

    ```
     HighLevelException: MidLevelException: LowLevelException
             at Junk.a(Junk.java:13)
             at Junk.main(Junk.java:4)
     Caused by: MidLevelException: LowLevelException
             at Junk.c(Junk.java:23)
             at Junk.b(Junk.java:17)
             at Junk.a(Junk.java:11)
             ... 1 more
     Caused by: LowLevelException
             at Junk.e(Junk.java:30)
             at Junk.d(Junk.java:27)
             at Junk.c(Junk.java:21)
             ... 3 more
    ```

    Note the presence of lines containing the characters `"..."`.
    These lines indicate that the remainder of the stack trace for this
    exception matches the indicated number of frames from the bottom of the
    stack trace of the exception that was caused by this exception (the
    "enclosing" exception). This shorthand can greatly reduce the length
    of the output in the common case where a wrapped exception is thrown
    from the same method as the "causative exception" is caught. The above
    example was produced by running the program:

    ```
     public class Junk {
         public static void main(String args[]) {
             try {
                 a();
             } catch(HighLevelException e) {
                 e.printStackTrace();
             }
         }
         static void a() throws HighLevelException {
             try {
                 b();
             } catch(MidLevelException e) {
                 throw new HighLevelException(e);
             }
         }
         static void b() throws MidLevelException {
             c();
         }
         static void c() throws MidLevelException {
             try {
                 d();
             } catch(LowLevelException e) {
                 throw new MidLevelException(e);
             }
         }
         static void d() throws LowLevelException {
            e();
         }
         static void e() throws LowLevelException {
             throw new LowLevelException();
         }
     }

     class HighLevelException extends Exception {
         HighLevelException(Throwable cause) { super(cause); }
     }

     class MidLevelException extends Exception {
         MidLevelException(Throwable cause)  { super(cause); }
     }

     class LowLevelException extends Exception {
     }
    ```

    As of release 7, the platform supports the notion of
    *suppressed exceptions* (in conjunction with the `try`-with-resources statement). Any exceptions that were
    suppressed in order to deliver an exception are printed out
    beneath the stack trace. The format of this information
    depends on the implementation, but the following example may be
    regarded as typical:

    ```
     Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: Something happened
             at Foo.bar(Foo.java:10)
             at Foo.main(Foo.java:5)
             Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 0
                     at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
                     at Foo.bar(Foo.java:9)
                     ... 1 more
    ```

    Note that the "... n more" notation is used on suppressed exceptions
    just as it is used on causes. Unlike causes, suppressed exceptions are
    indented beyond their "containing exceptions."

    An exception can have both a cause and one or more suppressed
    exceptions:

    ```
     Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: Main block
             at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:7)
             Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 2
                     at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
                     at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:5)
             Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 1
                     at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
                     at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:5)
     Caused by: java.lang.Exception: I did it
             at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:8)
    ```

    Likewise, a suppressed exception can have a cause:

    ```
     Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: Main block
             at Foo4.main(Foo4.java:6)
             Suppressed: Resource2$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 1
                     at Resource2.close(Resource2.java:20)
                     at Foo4.main(Foo4.java:5)
             Caused by: java.lang.Exception: Rats, you caught me
                     at Resource2$CloseFailException.<init>(Resource2.java:45)
                     ... 2 more
    ```
  + ### printStackTrace

    public void printStackTrace([PrintStream](../io/PrintStream.md "class in java.io") s)

    Prints this throwable and its backtrace to the specified print stream.

    Parameters:
    :   `s` - `PrintStream` to use for output
  + ### printStackTrace

    public void printStackTrace([PrintWriter](../io/PrintWriter.md "class in java.io") s)

    Prints this throwable and its backtrace to the specified
    print writer.

    Parameters:
    :   `s` - `PrintWriter` to use for output

    Since:
    :   1.1
  + ### fillInStackTrace

    public [Throwable](Throwable.md "class in java.lang") fillInStackTrace()

    Fills in the execution stack trace. This method records within this
    `Throwable` object information about the current state of
    the stack frames for the current thread.

    If the stack trace of this `Throwable` [is not
    writable](#%3Cinit%3E(java.lang.String,java.lang.Throwable,boolean,boolean)), calling this method has no effect.

    Returns:
    :   a reference to this `Throwable` instance.

    See Also:
    :   - [`printStackTrace()`](#printStackTrace())
  + ### getStackTrace

    public [StackTraceElement](StackTraceElement.md "class in java.lang")[] getStackTrace()

    Provides programmatic access to the stack trace information printed by
    [`printStackTrace()`](#printStackTrace()). Returns an array of stack trace elements,
    each representing one stack frame. The zeroth element of the array
    (assuming the array's length is non-zero) represents the top of the
    stack, which is the last method invocation in the sequence. Typically,
    this is the point at which this throwable was created and thrown.
    The last element of the array (assuming the array's length is non-zero)
    represents the bottom of the stack, which is the first method invocation
    in the sequence.

    Some virtual machines may, under some circumstances, omit one
    or more stack frames from the stack trace. In the extreme case,
    a virtual machine that has no stack trace information concerning
    this throwable is permitted to return a zero-length array from this
    method. Generally speaking, the array returned by this method will
    contain one element for every frame that would be printed by
    `printStackTrace`. Writes to the returned array do not
    affect future calls to this method.

    Returns:
    :   an array of stack trace elements representing the stack trace
        pertaining to this throwable.

  + ### setStackTrace

    public void setStackTrace([StackTraceElement](StackTraceElement.md "class in java.lang")[] stackTrace)

    Sets the stack trace elements that will be returned by
    [`getStackTrace()`](#getStackTrace()) and printed by [`printStackTrace()`](#printStackTrace())
    and related methods.
    This method, which is designed for use by RPC frameworks and other
    advanced systems, allows the client to override the default
    stack trace that is either generated by [`fillInStackTrace()`](#fillInStackTrace())
    when a throwable is constructed or deserialized when a throwable is
    read from a serialization stream.

    If the stack trace of this `Throwable` [is not
    writable](#%3Cinit%3E(java.lang.String,java.lang.Throwable,boolean,boolean)), calling this method has no effect other than
    validating its argument.

    Parameters:
    :   `stackTrace` - the stack trace elements to be associated with
        this `Throwable`. The specified array is copied by this
        call; changes in the specified array after the method invocation
        returns will have no effect on this `Throwable`'s stack
        trace.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `stackTrace` is
        `null` or if any of the elements of
        `stackTrace` are `null`

  + ### addSuppressed

    public final void addSuppressed([Throwable](Throwable.md "class in java.lang") exception)

    Appends the specified exception to the exceptions that were
    suppressed in order to deliver this exception. This method is
    thread-safe and typically called (automatically and implicitly)
    by the `try`-with-resources statement.

    The suppression behavior is enabled *unless* disabled
    [via
    a constructor](#%3Cinit%3E(java.lang.String,java.lang.Throwable,boolean,boolean)). When suppression is disabled, this method does
    nothing other than to validate its argument.

    Note that when one exception [causes](#initCause(java.lang.Throwable)) another exception, the first
    exception is usually caught and then the second exception is
    thrown in response. In other words, there is a causal
    connection between the two exceptions.
    In contrast, there are situations where two independent
    exceptions can be thrown in sibling code blocks, in particular
    in the `try` block of a `try`-with-resources
    statement and the compiler-generated `finally` block
    which closes the resource.
    In these situations, only one of the thrown exceptions can be
    propagated. In the `try`-with-resources statement, when
    there are two such exceptions, the exception originating from
    the `try` block is propagated and the exception from the
    `finally` block is added to the list of exceptions
    suppressed by the exception from the `try` block. As an
    exception unwinds the stack, it can accumulate multiple
    suppressed exceptions.

    An exception may have suppressed exceptions while also being
    caused by another exception. Whether or not an exception has a
    cause is semantically known at the time of its creation, unlike
    whether or not an exception will suppress other exceptions
    which is typically only determined after an exception is
    thrown.

    Note that programmer written code is also able to take
    advantage of calling this method in situations where there are
    multiple sibling exceptions and only one can be propagated.

    Parameters:
    :   `exception` - the exception to be added to the list of
        suppressed exceptions

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `exception` is this
        throwable; a throwable cannot suppress itself.
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `exception` is `null`

  + ### getSuppressed

    public final [Throwable](Throwable.md "class in java.lang")[] getSuppressed()

    Returns an array containing all of the exceptions that were
    suppressed, typically by the `try`-with-resources
    statement, in order to deliver this exception.
    If no exceptions were suppressed or [suppression is
    disabled](#%3Cinit%3E(java.lang.String,java.lang.Throwable,boolean,boolean)), an empty array is returned. This method is
    thread-safe. Writes to the returned array do not affect future
    calls to this method.

    Returns:
    :   an array containing all of the exceptions that were
        suppressed to deliver this exception.
