public class SecurityManager
extends [Object](Object.md "class in java.lang")

Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

The Security Manager is deprecated and subject to removal in a
future release. There is no replacement for the Security Manager.
See [JEP 411](https://openjdk.org/jeps/411) for
discussion and alternatives.

The security manager is a class that allows
applications to implement a security policy. It allows an
application to determine, before performing a possibly unsafe or
sensitive operation, what the operation is and whether
it is being attempted in a security context that allows the
operation to be performed. The
application can allow or disallow the operation.

The `SecurityManager` class contains many methods with
names that begin with the word `check`. These methods
are called by various methods in the Java libraries before those
methods perform certain potentially sensitive operations. The
invocation of such a `check` method typically looks like this:
> ```
>      SecurityManager security = System.getSecurityManager();
>      if (security != null) {
>          security.checkXXX(argument,  . . . );
>      }
> ```

The security manager is thereby given an opportunity to prevent
completion of the operation by throwing an exception. A security
manager routine simply returns if the operation is permitted, but
throws a `SecurityException` if the operation is not
permitted.

## Setting a Security Manager

Environments using a security manager will typically set the security
manager at startup. In the JDK implementation, this is done by setting the
system property `java.security.manager` on the command line
to the class name of the security manager. It can also be set to the empty
String ("") or the special token "`default`" to use the
default `java.lang.SecurityManager`. If a class name is specified,
it must be `java.lang.SecurityManager` or a public subclass and have
a public no-arg constructor. The class is loaded by the
[built-in system class loader](ClassLoader.md#getSystemClassLoader())
if it is not `java.lang.SecurityManager`. If the
`java.security.manager` system property is not set, the default value
is `null`, which means a security manager will not be set at startup.

The Java run-time may also allow, but is not required to allow, the security
manager to be set dynamically by invoking the
[`setSecurityManager`](System.md#setSecurityManager(java.lang.SecurityManager)) method.
In the JDK implementation, if the Java virtual machine is started with
the `java.security.manager` system property set to the special token
"`allow`", then a security manager will not be set at startup but can
be set dynamically. If the Java virtual machine is started with the
`java.security.manager` system property not set or set to the special
token "`disallow`", then a security manager will not be set at startup
and cannot be set dynamically (the
[`setSecurityManager`](System.md#setSecurityManager(java.lang.SecurityManager))
method will throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`). Finally, if the
`java.security.manager` system property is set to the class name of
the security manager, or to the empty String ("") or the special token
"`default`", then a security manager is set at startup (as described
previously) and can also be subsequently replaced (or disabled) dynamically
(subject to the policy of the currently installed security manager). The
following table illustrates the behavior of the JDK implementation for the
different settings of the `java.security.manager` system property:

property value,
the SecurityManager set at startup,
can dynamically set a SecurityManager

| Property Value | The SecurityManager set at startup | System.setSecurityManager run-time behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| null | None | Throws `UnsupportedOperationException` |
| empty String ("") | `java.lang.SecurityManager` | Success or throws `SecurityException` if not permitted by the currently installed security manager |
| "default" | `java.lang.SecurityManager` | Success or throws `SecurityException` if not permitted by the currently installed security manager |
| "disallow" | None | Throws `UnsupportedOperationException` |
| "allow" | None | Success or throws `SecurityException` if not permitted by the currently installed security manager |
| a class name | the named class | Success or throws `SecurityException` if not permitted by the currently installed security manager |

The current security manager is returned by the
[`getSecurityManager`](System.md#getSecurityManager()) method.

## Checking Permissions

The special method
[`checkPermission(java.security.Permission)`](#checkPermission(java.security.Permission))
determines whether an access request indicated by a specified
permission should be granted or denied. The
default implementation calls

```
   AccessController.checkPermission(perm);
```

If a requested access is allowed,
`checkPermission` returns quietly. If denied, a
`SecurityException` is thrown.

The default implementation of each of the other
`check` methods in `SecurityManager` is to
call the `SecurityManager checkPermission` method
to determine if the calling thread has permission to perform the requested
operation.

Note that the `checkPermission` method with
just a single permission argument always performs security checks
within the context of the currently executing thread.
Sometimes a security check that should be made within a given context
will actually need to be done from within a
*different* context (for example, from within a worker thread).
The [`getSecurityContext`](#getSecurityContext()) method
and the [`checkPermission`](#checkPermission(java.security.Permission,java.lang.Object))
method that includes a context argument are provided
for this situation. The
`getSecurityContext` method returns a "snapshot"
of the current calling context. (The default implementation
returns an AccessControlContext object.) A sample call is
the following:

```
   Object context = null;
   SecurityManager sm = System.getSecurityManager();
   if (sm != null) context = sm.getSecurityContext();
```

The `checkPermission` method
that takes a context object in addition to a permission
makes access decisions based on that context,
rather than on that of the current execution thread.
Code within a different context can thus call that method,
passing the permission and the
previously-saved context object. A sample call, using the
SecurityManager `sm` obtained as in the previous example,
is the following:

```
   if (sm != null) sm.checkPermission(permission, context);
```

Permissions fall into these categories: File, Socket, Net,
Security, Runtime, Property, AWT, Reflect, and Serializable.
The classes managing these various
permission categories are `java.io.FilePermission`,
`java.net.SocketPermission`,
`java.net.NetPermission`,
`java.security.SecurityPermission`,
`java.lang.RuntimePermission`,
`java.util.PropertyPermission`,
`java.awt.AWTPermission`,
`java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission`, and
`java.io.SerializablePermission`.

All but the first two (FilePermission and SocketPermission) are
subclasses of `java.security.BasicPermission`, which itself
is an abstract subclass of the
top-level class for permissions, which is
`java.security.Permission`. BasicPermission defines the
functionality needed for all permissions that contain a name
that follows the hierarchical property naming convention
(for example, "exitVM", "setFactory", "queuePrintJob", etc).
An asterisk
may appear at the end of the name, following a ".", or by itself, to
signify a wildcard match. For example: "a.\*" or "\*" is valid,
"\*a" or "a\*b" is not valid.

FilePermission and SocketPermission are subclasses of the
top-level class for permissions
(`java.security.Permission`). Classes like these
that have a more complicated name syntax than that used by
BasicPermission subclass directly from Permission rather than from
BasicPermission. For example,
for a `java.io.FilePermission` object, the permission name is
the path name of a file (or directory).

Some of the permission classes have an "actions" list that tells
the actions that are permitted for the object. For example,
for a `java.io.FilePermission` object, the actions list
(such as "read, write") specifies which actions are granted for the
specified file (or for files in the specified directory).

Other permission classes are for "named" permissions -
ones that contain a name but no actions list; you either have the
named permission or you don't.

Note: There is also a `java.security.AllPermission`
permission that implies all permissions. It exists to simplify the work
of system administrators who might need to perform multiple
tasks that require all (or numerous) permissions.

See
for permission-related information.
This document includes a table listing the various SecurityManager
`check` methods and the permission(s) the default
implementation of each such method requires.
It also contains a table of the methods
that require permissions, and for each such method tells
which permission it requires.

  + ### SecurityManager

    public SecurityManager()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Constructs a new `SecurityManager`.

    If there is a security manager already installed, this method first
    calls the security manager's `checkPermission` method
    with the `RuntimePermission("createSecurityManager")`
    permission to ensure the calling thread has permission to create a new
    security manager.
    This may result in throwing a `SecurityException`.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager already
        exists and its `checkPermission` method
        doesn't allow creation of a new security manager.

  + ### getClassContext

    protected [Class](Class.md "class in java.lang")<?>[] getClassContext()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Returns the current execution stack as an array of classes.

    The length of the array is the number of methods on the execution
    stack. The element at index `0` is the class of the
    currently executing method, the element at index `1` is
    the class of that method's caller, and so on.

    Returns:
    :   the execution stack.
  + ### getSecurityContext

    public [Object](Object.md "class in java.lang") getSecurityContext()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Creates an object that encapsulates the current execution
    environment. The result of this method is used, for example, by the
    three-argument `checkConnect` method and by the
    two-argument `checkRead` method.
    These methods are needed because a trusted method may be called
    on to read a file or open a socket on behalf of another method.
    The trusted method needs to determine if the other (possibly
    untrusted) method would be allowed to perform the operation on its
    own.

    The default implementation of this method is to return
    an `AccessControlContext` object.

    Returns:
    :   an implementation-dependent object that encapsulates
        sufficient information about the current execution environment
        to perform some security checks later.

  + ### checkPermission

    public void checkPermission([Permission](../security/Permission.md "class in java.security") perm)

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Throws a `SecurityException` if the requested
    access, specified by the given permission, is not permitted based
    on the security policy currently in effect.

    This method calls `AccessController.checkPermission`
    with the given permission.

    Parameters:
    :   `perm` - the requested permission.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if access is not permitted based on
        the current security policy.
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the permission argument is
        `null`.

    Since:
    :   1.2
  + ### checkPermission

    public void checkPermission([Permission](../security/Permission.md "class in java.security") perm,
    [Object](Object.md "class in java.lang") context)

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Throws a `SecurityException` if the
    specified security context is denied access to the resource
    specified by the given permission.
    The context must be a security
    context returned by a previous call to
    `getSecurityContext` and the access control
    decision is based upon the configured security policy for
    that security context.

    If `context` is an instance of
    `AccessControlContext` then the
    `AccessControlContext.checkPermission` method is
    invoked with the specified permission.

    If `context` is not an instance of
    `AccessControlContext` then a
    `SecurityException` is thrown.

    Parameters:
    :   `perm` - the specified permission
    :   `context` - a system-dependent security context.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if the specified security context
        is not an instance of `AccessControlContext`
        (e.g., is `null`), or is denied access to the
        resource specified by the given permission.
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the permission argument is
        `null`.

    Since:
    :   1.2

  + ### checkCreateClassLoader

    public void checkCreateClassLoader()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Throws a `SecurityException` if the
    calling thread is not allowed to create a new class loader.

    This method calls `checkPermission` with the
    `RuntimePermission("createClassLoader")`
    permission.

    If you override this method, then you should make a call to
    `super.checkCreateClassLoader`
    at the point the overridden method would normally throw an
    exception.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if the calling thread does not
        have permission
        to create a new class loader.

  + ### checkAccess

    public void checkAccess([Thread](Thread.md "class in java.lang") t)

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Throws a `SecurityException` if the
    calling thread is not allowed to modify the thread argument.

    This method is invoked for the current security manager by the
    `setPriority`, `setName`, and
    `setDaemon` methods of class `Thread`.

    If the thread argument is a system thread (belongs to
    the thread group with a `null` parent) then
    this method calls `checkPermission` with the
    `RuntimePermission("modifyThread")` permission.
    If the thread argument is *not* a system thread,
    this method just returns silently.

    Applications that want a stricter policy should override this
    method. If this method is overridden, the method that overrides
    it should additionally check to see if the calling thread has the
    `RuntimePermission("modifyThread")` permission, and
    if so, return silently. This is to ensure that code granted
    that permission (such as the JDK itself) is allowed to
    manipulate any thread.

    If this method is overridden, then
    `super.checkAccess` should
    be called by the first statement in the overridden method, or the
    equivalent security check should be placed in the overridden method.

    Parameters:
    :   `t` - the thread to be checked.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if the calling thread does not have
        permission to modify the thread.
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the thread argument is
        `null`.

  + ### checkAccess

    public void checkAccess([ThreadGroup](ThreadGroup.md "class in java.lang") g)

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Throws a `SecurityException` if the
    calling thread is not allowed to modify the thread group argument.

    This method is invoked for the current security manager when a
    new child thread or child thread group is created, and by the
    `setDaemon` and `setMaxPriority` methods of class
    `ThreadGroup`.

    If the thread group argument is the system thread group (
    has a `null` parent) then
    this method calls `checkPermission` with the
    `RuntimePermission("modifyThreadGroup")` permission.
    If the thread group argument is *not* the system thread group,
    this method just returns silently.

    Applications that want a stricter policy should override this
    method. If this method is overridden, the method that overrides
    it should additionally check to see if the calling thread has the
    `RuntimePermission("modifyThreadGroup")` permission, and
    if so, return silently. This is to ensure that code granted
    that permission (such as the JDK itself) is allowed to
    manipulate any thread.

    If this method is overridden, then
    `super.checkAccess` should
    be called by the first statement in the overridden method, or the
    equivalent security check should be placed in the overridden method.

    Parameters:
    :   `g` - the thread group to be checked.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if the calling thread does not have
        permission to modify the thread group.
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the thread group argument is
        `null`.

  + ### checkExit

    public void checkExit(int status)

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Throws a `SecurityException` if the
    calling thread is not allowed to cause the Java Virtual Machine to
    halt with the specified status code.

    This method is invoked for the current security manager by the
    `exit` method of class `Runtime`. A status
    of `0` indicates success; other values indicate various
    errors.

    This method calls `checkPermission` with the
    `RuntimePermission("exitVM."+status)` permission.

    If you override this method, then you should make a call to

    method is attempting to determine the IP address of the specified
    host name.

    If `context` is not an instance of
    `AccessControlContext` then a
    `SecurityException` is thrown.

    Otherwise, the port number is checked. If it is not equal
    to -1, the `context`'s `checkPermission`
    method is called with a
    `SocketPermission(host+":"+port,"connect")` permission.
    If the port is equal to -1, then
    the `context`'s `checkPermission` method
    is called with a
    `SocketPermission(host,"resolve")` permission.

  + ### checkSecurityAccess

    public void checkSecurityAccess([String](String.md "class in java.lang") target)

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Determines whether the permission with the specified permission target
    name should be granted or denied.

    If the requested permission is allowed, this method returns
    quietly. If denied, a SecurityException is raised.

    This method creates a `SecurityPermission` object for
    the given permission target name and calls `checkPermission`
    with it.

    See the documentation for
    `SecurityPermission` for
    a list of possible permission target names.

    If you override this method, then you should make a call to
    `super.checkSecurityAccess`
    at the point the overridden method would normally throw an
    exception.

    Parameters:
    :   `target` - the target name of the `SecurityPermission`.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if the calling thread does not have
        permission for the requested access.
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `target` is null.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `target` is empty.

    Since:
    :   1.1

  + ### getThreadGroup

    public [ThreadGroup](ThreadGroup.md "class in java.lang") getThreadGroup()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Returns the thread group into which to instantiate any new
    thread being created at the time this is being called.
    By default, it returns the thread group of the current
    thread. This should be overridden by a specific security
    manager to return the appropriate thread group.

    Returns:
    :   ThreadGroup that new threads are instantiated into

    Since:
    :   1.1
