# Class ThreadLocal<T>

[java.lang.Object](Object.md "class in java.lang")

java.lang.ThreadLocal<T>

Type Parameters:
:   `T` - the type of the thread local's value

Direct Known Subclasses:
:   `InheritableThreadLocal`

public class ThreadLocal<T>
extends [Object](Object.md "class in java.lang")

This class provides thread-local variables. These variables differ from
their normal counterparts in that each thread that accesses one (via its
`get` or `set` method) has its own, independently initialized
copy of the variable. `ThreadLocal` instances are typically private
static fields in classes that wish to associate state with a thread (e.g.,
a user ID or Transaction ID).

For example, the class below generates unique identifiers local to each
thread.
A thread's id is assigned the first time it invokes `ThreadId.get()`
and remains unchanged on subsequent calls.

```
 import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

 public class ThreadId {
     // Atomic integer containing the next thread ID to be assigned
     private static final AtomicInteger nextId = new AtomicInteger(0);

     // Thread local variable containing each thread's ID
     private static final ThreadLocal<Integer> threadId =
         new ThreadLocal<Integer>() {
             @Override protected Integer initialValue() {
                 return nextId.getAndIncrement();
         }
     };

     // Returns the current thread's unique ID, assigning it if necessary
     public static int get() {
         return threadId.get();
     }
 }
```

Each thread holds an implicit reference to its copy of a thread-local
variable as long as the thread is alive and the `ThreadLocal`
instance is accessible; after a thread goes away, all of its copies of
thread-local instances are subject to garbage collection (unless other
references to these copies exist).

* ## Method Details

  + ### initialValue

    protected [T](ThreadLocal.md "type parameter in ThreadLocal") initialValue()

    Returns the current thread's "initial value" for this
    thread-local variable. This method will be invoked the first
    time a thread accesses the variable with the [`get()`](#get())
    method, unless the thread previously invoked the [`set(T)`](#set(T))
    method, in which case the `initialValue` method will not
    be invoked for the thread. Normally, this method is invoked at
    most once per thread, but it may be invoked again in case of
    subsequent invocations of [`remove()`](#remove()) followed by [`get()`](#get()).

    Returns:
    :   the initial value for this thread-local

    See Also:
    :   - [`withInitial(java.util.function.Supplier)`](#withInitial(java.util.function.Supplier))
  + ### withInitial

    public static <S> [ThreadLocal](ThreadLocal.md "class in java.lang")<S> withInitial([Supplier](../util/function/Supplier.md "interface in java.util.function")<? extends S> supplier)

    Creates a thread local variable. The initial value of the variable is
    determined by invoking the `get` method on the `Supplier`.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `S` - the type of the thread local's value

    Parameters:
    :   `supplier` - the supplier to be used to determine the initial value

    Returns:
    :   a new thread local variable

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified supplier is null

  + ### get

    public [T](ThreadLocal.md "type parameter in ThreadLocal") get()

    Returns the value in the current thread's copy of this
    thread-local variable. If the variable has no value for the
    current thread, it is first initialized to the value returned
    by an invocation of the [`initialValue()`](#initialValue()) method.

    Returns:
    :   the current thread's value of this thread-local
  + ### set

    public void set([T](ThreadLocal.md "type parameter in ThreadLocal") value)

    Sets the current thread's copy of this thread-local variable
    to the specified value. Most subclasses will have no need to
    override this method, relying solely on the [`initialValue()`](#initialValue())
    method to set the values of thread-locals.

    Parameters:
    :   `value` - the value to be stored in the current thread's copy of
        this thread-local.
  + ### remove

    public void remove()

    Removes the current thread's value for this thread-local
    variable. If this thread-local variable is subsequently
    [read](#get()) by the current thread, its value will be
    reinitialized by invoking its [`initialValue()`](#initialValue()) method,
    unless its value is [set](#set(T)) by the current thread
    in the interim. This may result in multiple invocations of the
    `initialValue` method in the current thread.
