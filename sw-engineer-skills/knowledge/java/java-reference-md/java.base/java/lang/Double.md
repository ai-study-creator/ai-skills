public final class Double
extends [Number](Number.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Comparable](Comparable.md "interface in java.lang")<[Double](Double.md "class in java.lang")>, [Constable](constant/Constable.md "interface in java.lang.constant"), [ConstantDesc](constant/ConstantDesc.md "interface in java.lang.constant")

The `Double` class wraps a value of the primitive type
`double` in an object. An object of type
`Double` contains a single field whose type is
`double`.

In addition, this class provides several methods for converting a
`double` to a `String` and a
`String` to a `double`, as well as other
constants and methods useful when dealing with a
`double`.

This is a [value-based](../../../java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.md)
class; programmers should treat instances that are
[equal](#equals(java.lang.Object)) as interchangeable and should not
use instances for synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may
occur. For example, in a future release, synchronization may fail.

## Floating-point Equality, Equivalence, and Comparison

IEEE 754 floating-point values include finite nonzero values,
signed zeros (`+0.0` and `-0.0`), signed infinities
([positive infinity](#POSITIVE_INFINITY) and
[negative infinity](#NEGATIVE_INFINITY)), and
[NaN](#NaN) (not-a-number).

An *equivalence relation* on a set of values is a boolean
relation on pairs of values that is reflexive, symmetric, and
transitive. For more discussion of equivalence relations and object
equality, see the [`Object.equals`](Object.md#equals(java.lang.Object))
specification. An equivalence relation partitions the values it
operates over into sets called *equivalence classes*. All the
members of the equivalence class are equal to each other under the
relation. An equivalence class may contain only a single member. At
least for some purposes, all the members of an equivalence class
are substitutable for each other. In particular, in a numeric
expression equivalent values can be *substituted* for one
another without changing the result of the expression, meaning
changing the equivalence class of the result of the expression.

Notably, the built-in `==` operation on floating-point
values is *not* an equivalence relation. Despite not
defining an equivalence relation, the semantics of the IEEE 754
`==` operator were deliberately designed to meet other needs
of numerical computation. There are two exceptions where the
properties of an equivalence relation are not satisfied by `==` on floating-point values:

* If `v1` and `v2` are both NaN, then `v1
  == v2` has the value `false`. Therefore, for two NaN
  arguments the *reflexive* property of an equivalence
  relation is *not* satisfied by the `==` operator.* If `v1` represents `+0.0` while `v2`
    represents `-0.0`, or vice versa, then `v1 == v2` has
    the value `true` even though `+0.0` and `-0.0`
    are distinguishable under various floating-point operations. For
    example, `1.0/+0.0` evaluates to positive infinity while
    `1.0/-0.0` evaluates to *negative* infinity and
    positive infinity and negative infinity are neither equal to each
    other nor equivalent to each other. Thus, while a signed zero input
    most commonly determines the sign of a zero result, because of
    dividing by zero, `+0.0` and `-0.0` may not be
    substituted for each other in general. The sign of a zero input
    also has a non-substitutable effect on the result of some math
    library methods.

For ordered comparisons using the built-in comparison operators
(`<`, `<=`, etc.), NaN values have another anomalous
situation: a NaN is neither less than, nor greater than, nor equal
to any value, including itself. This means the *trichotomy of
comparison* does *not* hold.

To provide the appropriate semantics for `equals` and
`compareTo` methods, those methods cannot simply be wrappers
around `==` or ordered comparison operations. Instead, [`equals`](#equals(java.lang.Object)) uses  [representation
equivalence](#repEquivalence), defining NaN arguments to be equal to each other,
restoring reflexivity, and defining `+0.0` to *not* be
equal to `-0.0`. For comparisons, [`compareTo`](#compareTo(java.lang.Double)) defines a total order where `-0.0` is less than
`+0.0` and where a NaN is equal to itself and considered
greater than positive infinity.

The operational semantics of `equals` and `compareTo` are expressed in terms of [bit-wise converting](#doubleToLongBits(double)) the floating-point values to integral values.

The *natural ordering* implemented by [`compareTo`](#compareTo(java.lang.Double)) is [consistent with equals](Comparable.md "interface in java.lang"). That
is, two objects are reported as equal by `equals` if and only
if `compareTo` on those objects returns zero.

The adjusted behaviors defined for `equals` and `compareTo` allow instances of wrapper classes to work properly with
conventional data structures. For example, defining NaN
values to be `equals` to one another allows NaN to be used as
an element of a [`HashSet`](../util/HashSet.md "class in java.util") or as the key of
a [`HashMap`](../util/HashMap.md "class in java.util"). Similarly, defining `compareTo` as a total ordering, including `+0.0`, `-0.0`, and NaN, allows instances of wrapper classes to be used as
elements of a [`SortedSet`](../util/SortedSet.md "interface in java.util") or as keys of a
[`SortedMap`](../util/SortedMap.md "interface in java.util").

Comparing numerical equality to various useful equivalence
relations that can be defined over floating-point values:

*numerical equality* (`==` operator): (*Not* an equivalence relation)
:   Two floating-point values represent the same extended real
    number. The extended real numbers are the real numbers augmented
    with positive infinity and negative infinity. Under numerical
    equality, `+0.0` and `-0.0` are equal since they both
    map to the same real value, 0. A NaN does not map to any real
    number and is not equal to any value, including itself.

*bit-wise equivalence*:
:   The bits of the two floating-point values are the same. This
    equivalence relation for `double` values `a` and `b` is implemented by the expression
      
    `Double.doubleTo``Raw``LongBits(a) == Double.doubleTo``Raw``LongBits(b)`  
    Under this relation, `+0.0` and `-0.0` are
    distinguished from each other and every bit pattern encoding a NaN
    is distinguished from every other bit pattern encoding a NaN.

*representation equivalence*:
:   The two floating-point values represent the same IEEE 754
    *datum*. In particular, for [finite](#isFinite(double)) values, the sign, [exponent](Math.md#getExponent(double)), and significand components of the floating-point values
    are the same. Under this relation:

    * `+0.0` and `-0.0` are distinguished from each other.* every bit pattern encoding a NaN is considered equivalent to each other* positive infinity is equivalent to positive infinity; negative
          infinity is equivalent to negative infinity.

    Expressions implementing this equivalence relation include:

    * `Double.doubleToLongBits(a) == Double.doubleToLongBits(b)`* `Double.valueOf(a).equals(Double.valueOf(b))`* `Double.compare(a, b) == 0`

    Note that representation equivalence is often an appropriate notion
    of equivalence to test the behavior of [math
    libraries](StrictMath.md "class in java.lang").

For two binary floating-point values `a` and `b`, if
neither of `a` and `b` is zero or NaN, then the three
relations numerical equality, bit-wise equivalence, and
representation equivalence of `a` and `b` have the same
`true`/`false` value. In other words, for binary
floating-point values, the three relations only differ if at least
one argument is zero or NaN.

  + ### toString

    public static [String](String.md "class in java.lang") toString(double d)

    Returns a string representation of the `double`
    argument. All characters mentioned below are ASCII characters.
    - If the argument is NaN, the result is the string
      "`NaN`".- Otherwise, the result is a string that represents the sign and
        magnitude (absolute value) of the argument. If the sign is negative,
        the first character of the result is '`-`'
        (`'\u002D'`); if the sign is positive, no sign character
        appears in the result. As for the magnitude *m*:
        * If *m* is infinity, it is represented by the characters
          `"Infinity"`; thus, positive infinity produces the result
          `"Infinity"` and negative infinity produces the result
          `"-Infinity"`.* If *m* is zero, it is represented by the characters
            `"0.0"`; thus, negative zero produces the result
            `"-0.0"` and positive zero produces the result
            `"0.0"`.* Otherwise *m* is positive and finite.
              It is converted to a string in two stages:
              + *Selection of a decimal*:
                A well-defined decimal *d**m*
                is selected to represent *m*.
                This decimal is (almost always) the *shortest* one that
                rounds to *m* according to the round to nearest
                rounding policy of IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic.+ *Formatting as a string*:
                  The decimal *d**m* is formatted as a string,
                  either in plain or in computerized scientific notation,
                  depending on its value.

    A *decimal* is a number of the form
    *s*×10*i*
    for some (unique) integers *s* > 0 and *i* such that
    *s* is not a multiple of 10.
    These integers are the *significand* and
    the *exponent*, respectively, of the decimal.
    The *length* of the decimal is the (unique)
    positive integer *n* meeting
    10*n*-1 ≤ *s* < 10*n*.

    The decimal *d**m* for a finite positive *m*
    is defined as follows:
    - Let *R* be the set of all decimals that round to *m*
      according to the usual *round to nearest* rounding policy of
      IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic.- Let *p* be the minimal length over all decimals in *R*.- When *p* ≥ 2, let *T* be the set of all decimals
          in *R* with length *p*.
          Otherwise, let *T* be the set of all decimals
          in *R* with length 1 or 2.- Define *d**m* as the decimal in *T*
            that is closest to *m*.
            Or if there are two such decimals in *T*,
            select the one with the even significand.

    The (uniquely) selected decimal *d**m*
    is then formatted.
    Let *s*, *i* and *n* be the significand, exponent and
    length of *d**m*, respectively.
    Further, let *e* = *n* + *i* - 1 and let
    *s*1…*s**n*
    be the usual decimal expansion of *s*.
    Note that *s*1 ≠ 0
    and *s**n* ≠ 0.
    Below, the decimal point `'.'` is `'\u002E'`
    and the exponent indicator `'E'` is `'\u0045'`.
    - Case -3 ≤ *e* < 0:
      *d**m* is formatted as
      `0.0`…`0`*s*1…*s**n*,
      where there are exactly -(*n* + *i*) zeroes between
      the decimal point and *s*1.
      For example, 123 × 10-4 is formatted as
      `0.0123`.- Case 0 ≤ *e* < 7:
        * Subcase *i* ≥ 0:
          *d**m* is formatted as
          *s*1…*s**n*`0`…`0.0`,
          where there are exactly *i* zeroes
          between *s**n* and the decimal point.
          For example, 123 × 102 is formatted as
          `12300.0`.* Subcase *i* < 0:
            *d**m* is formatted as
            *s*1…*s**n*+*i*`.`*s**n*+*i*+1…*s**n*,
            where there are exactly -*i* digits to the right of
            the decimal point.
            For example, 123 × 10-1 is formatted as
            `12.3`.- Case *e* < -3 or *e* ≥ 7:
          computerized scientific notation is used to format
          *d**m*.
          Here *e* is formatted as by [`Integer.toString(int)`](Integer.md#toString(int)).
          * Subcase *n* = 1:
            *d**m* is formatted as
            *s*1`.0E`*e*.
            For example, 1 × 1023 is formatted as
            `1.0E23`.* Subcase *n* > 1:
              *d**m* is formatted as
              *s*1`.`*s*2…*s**n*`E`*e*.
              For example, 123 × 10-21 is formatted as
              `1.23E-19`.

    To create localized string representations of a floating-point
    value, use subclasses of [`NumberFormat`](../text/NumberFormat.md "class in java.text").

    Parameters:
    :   `d` - the `double` to be converted.

    Returns:
    :   a string representation of the argument.
  + ### toHexString

    public static [String](String.md "class in java.lang") toHexString(double d)

    Returns a hexadecimal string representation of the
    `double` argument. All characters mentioned below
    are ASCII characters.
    - If the argument is NaN, the result is the string
      "`NaN`".- Otherwise, the result is a string that represents the sign
        and magnitude of the argument. If the sign is negative, the
        first character of the result is '`-`'
        (`'\u002D'`); if the sign is positive, no sign
        character appears in the result. As for the magnitude *m*:
        * If *m* is infinity, it is represented by the string
          `"Infinity"`; thus, positive infinity produces the
          result `"Infinity"` and negative infinity produces
          the result `"-Infinity"`.* If *m* is zero, it is represented by the string
            `"0x0.0p0"`; thus, negative zero produces the result
            `"-0x0.0p0"` and positive zero produces the result
            `"0x0.0p0"`.* If *m* is a `double` value with a
              normalized representation, substrings are used to represent the
              significand and exponent fields. The significand is
              represented by the characters `"0x1."`
              followed by a lowercase hexadecimal representation of the rest
              of the significand as a fraction. Trailing zeros in the
              hexadecimal representation are removed unless all the digits
              are zero, in which case a single zero is used. Next, the
              exponent is represented by `"p"` followed
              by a decimal string of the unbiased exponent as if produced by
              a call to [`Integer.toString`](Integer.md#toString(int)) on the
              exponent value.* If *m* is a `double` value with a subnormal
                representation, the significand is represented by the
                characters `"0x0."` followed by a
                hexadecimal representation of the rest of the significand as a
                fraction. Trailing zeros in the hexadecimal representation are
                removed. Next, the exponent is represented by
                `"p-1022"`. Note that there must be at
                least one nonzero digit in a subnormal significand.

    Examples

    | Floating-point Value | Hexadecimal String |
    | --- | --- |
    | `1.0` | `0x1.0p0` || `-1.0` | `-0x1.0p0` || `2.0` | `0x1.0p1` || `3.0` | `0x1.8p1` || `0.5` | `0x1.0p-1` || `0.25` | `0x1.0p-2` || `Double.MAX_VALUE` | `0x1.fffffffffffffp1023` || `Minimum Normal Value` | `0x1.0p-1022` || `Maximum Subnormal Value` | `0x0.fffffffffffffp-1022` || `Double.MIN_VALUE` | `0x0.0000000000001p-1022` |

    Parameters:
    :   `d` - the `double` to be converted.

    Returns:
    :   a hex string representation of the argument.

  + ### valueOf

    public static [Double](Double.md "class in java.lang") valueOf([String](String.md "class in java.lang") s)
    throws [NumberFormatException](NumberFormatException.md "class in java.lang")

    Returns a `Double` object holding the
    `double` value represented by the argument string
    `s`.

    If `s` is `null`, then a
    `NullPointerException` is thrown.

    Leading and trailing whitespace characters in `s`
    are ignored. Whitespace is removed as if by the [`String.trim()`](String.md#trim()) method; that is, both ASCII space and control
    characters are removed. The rest of `s` should
    constitute a *FloatValue* as described by the lexical
    syntax rules:
    > *FloatValue:*: *Signopt* `NaN`: *Signopt* `Infinity`: *Signopt FloatingPointLiteral*: *Signopt HexFloatingPointLiteral*: *SignedInteger*
    >
    > *HexFloatingPointLiteral*:: *HexSignificand BinaryExponent FloatTypeSuffixopt*
    >
    > *HexSignificand:*: *HexNumeral*: *HexNumeral* `.`: `0x` *HexDigitsopt*`.` *HexDigits*: `0X` *HexDigitsopt*`.` *HexDigits*
    >
    > *BinaryExponent:*: *BinaryExponentIndicator SignedInteger*
    >
    > *BinaryExponentIndicator:*: `p`: `P`

    where *Sign*, *FloatingPointLiteral*,
    *HexNumeral*, *HexDigits*, *SignedInteger* and
    *FloatTypeSuffix* are as defined in the lexical structure
    sections of
    The Java Language Specification,
    except that underscores are not accepted between digits.
    If `s` does not have the form of
    a *FloatValue*, then a `NumberFormatException`
    is thrown. Otherwise, `s` is regarded as
    representing an exact decimal value in the usual
    "computerized scientific notation" or as an exact
    hexadecimal value; this exact numerical value is then
    conceptually converted to an "infinitely precise"
    binary value that is then rounded to type `double`
    by the usual round-to-nearest rule of IEEE 754 floating-point
    arithmetic, which includes preserving the sign of a zero
    value.
    Note that the round-to-nearest rule also implies overflow and
    underflow behaviour; if the exact value of `s` is large
    enough in magnitude (greater than or equal to ([`MAX_VALUE`](#MAX_VALUE) + [`ulp(MAX_VALUE)`](Math.md#ulp(double))/2),
    rounding to `double` will result in an infinity and if the
    exact value of `s` is small enough in magnitude (less
    than or equal to [`MIN_VALUE`](#MIN_VALUE)/2), rounding to float will
    result in a zero.
    Finally, after rounding a `Double` object representing
    this `double` value is returned.

    To interpret localized string representations of a
    floating-point value, use subclasses of [`NumberFormat`](../text/NumberFormat.md "class in java.text").

    Note that trailing format specifiers, specifiers that
    determine the type of a floating-point literal
    (`1.0f` is a `float` value;
    `1.0d` is a `double` value), do
    *not* influence the results of this method. In other
    words, the numerical value of the input string is converted
    directly to the target floating-point type. The two-step
    sequence of conversions, string to `float` followed
    by `float` to `double`, is *not*
    equivalent to converting a string directly to
    `double`. For example, the `float`
    literal `0.1f` is equal to the `double`
    value `0.10000000149011612`; the `float`
    literal `0.1f` represents a different numerical
    value than the `double` literal
    `0.1`. (The numerical value 0.1 cannot be exactly
    represented in a binary floating-point number.)

    To avoid calling this method on an invalid string and having
    a `NumberFormatException` be thrown, the regular
    expression below can be used to screen the input string:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
     final String Digits     = "(\\p{Digit}+)";
     final String HexDigits  = "(\\p{XDigit}+)";

     // signed decimal integer.
     final String Exp        = "[eE][+-]?"+Digits;

     }
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `s` - the string to be parsed.

    Returns:
    :   a `Double` object holding the value
        represented by the `String` argument.

    Throws:
    :   `NumberFormatException` - if the string does not contain a
        parsable number.
  + ### valueOf

    public static [Double](Double.md "class in java.lang") valueOf(double d)

    Returns a `Double` instance representing the specified
    `double` value.
    If a new `Double` instance is not required, this method
    should generally be used in preference to the constructor
    [`Double(double)`](#%3Cinit%3E(double)), as this method is likely to yield
    significantly better space and time performance by caching
    frequently requested values.

    Parameters:
    :   `d` - a double value.

    Returns:
    :   a `Double` instance representing `d`.

    Since:
    :   1.5

    Returns a new `double` initialized to the value
    represented by the specified `String`, as performed
    by the `valueOf` method of class
    `Double`.

    Parameters:
    :   `s` - the string to be parsed.

    Returns:
    :   the `double` value represented by the string
        argument.

    Throws:

    :   `NumberFormatException` - if the string does not contain
        a parsable `double`.

    Compares this object against the specified object. The result
    is `true` if and only if the argument is not
    `null` and is a `Double` object that
    represents a `double` that has the same value as the
    `double` represented by this object. For this
    purpose, two `double` values are considered to be
    the same if and only if the method [`doubleToLongBits(double)`](#doubleToLongBits(double)) returns the identical
    `long` value when applied to each.

    Overrides:
    :   `equals` in class `Object`

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - the reference object with which to compare.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this object is the same as the obj
        argument; `false` otherwise.

    See Also:
    :   - [`doubleToLongBits(double)`](#doubleToLongBits(double))
  + ### doubleToLongBits

    public static long doubleToLongBits(double value)

    Returns a representation of the specified floating-point value
    according to the IEEE 754 floating-point "double
    format" bit layout.

    Bit 63 (the bit that is selected by the mask
    `0x8000000000000000L`) represents the sign of the
    floating-point number. Bits
    62-52 (the bits that are selected by the mask
    `0x7ff0000000000000L`) represent the exponent. Bits 51-0
    (the bits that are selected by the mask
    `0x000fffffffffffffL`) represent the significand
    (sometimes called the mantissa) of the floating-point number.

    If the argument is positive infinity, the result is
    `0x7ff0000000000000L`.

    If the argument is negative infinity, the result is
    `0xfff0000000000000L`.

    If the argument is NaN, the result is
    `0x7ff8000000000000L`.

    In all cases, the result is a `long` integer that, when
    given to the [`longBitsToDouble(long)`](#longBitsToDouble(long)) method, will produce a
    floating-point value the same as the argument to
    `doubleToLongBits` (except all NaN values are
    collapsed to a single "canonical" NaN value).

    Parameters:
    :   `value` - a `double` precision floating-point number.

    Returns:
    :   the bits that represent the floating-point number.
  + ### doubleToRawLongBits

    public static long doubleToRawLongBits(double value)

    Returns a representation of the specified floating-point value
    according to the IEEE 754 floating-point "double
    format" bit layout, preserving Not-a-Number (NaN) values.

    Bit 63 (the bit that is selected by the mask
    `0x8000000000000000L`) represents the sign of the
    floating-point number. Bits
    62-52 (the bits that are selected by the mask
    `0x7ff0000000000000L`) represent the exponent. Bits 51-0
    (the bits that are selected by the mask
    `0x000fffffffffffffL`) represent the significand
    (sometimes called the mantissa) of the floating-point number.

    If the argument is positive infinity, the result is
    `0x7ff0000000000000L`.

    If the argument is negative infinity, the result is
    `0xfff0000000000000L`.

    If the argument is NaN, the result is the `long`
    integer representing the actual NaN value. Unlike the
    `doubleToLongBits` method,
    `doubleToRawLongBits` does not collapse all the bit
    patterns encoding a NaN to a single "canonical" NaN
    value.

    In all cases, the result is a `long` integer that,
    when given to the [`longBitsToDouble(long)`](#longBitsToDouble(long)) method, will
    produce a floating-point value the same as the argument to
    `doubleToRawLongBits`.

    Parameters:
    :   `value` - a `double` precision floating-point number.

    Returns:
    :   the bits that represent the floating-point number.

    Since:
    :   1.3
  + ### longBitsToDouble

    public static double longBitsToDouble(long bits)

    Returns the `double` value corresponding to a given
    bit representation.
    The argument is considered to be a representation of a
    floating-point value according to the IEEE 754 floating-point
    "double format" bit layout.

    If the argument is `0x7ff0000000000000L`, the result
    is positive infinity.

    If the argument is `0xfff0000000000000L`, the result
    is negative infinity.

    If the argument is any value in the range
    `0x7ff0000000000001L` through
    `0x7fffffffffffffffL` or in the range
    `0xfff0000000000001L` through
    `0xffffffffffffffffL`, the result is a NaN. No IEEE
    754 floating-point operation provided by Java can distinguish
    between two NaN values of the same type with different bit
    patterns. Distinct values of NaN are only distinguishable by
    use of the `Double.doubleToRawLongBits` method.

    In all other cases, let *s*, *e*, and *m* be three
    values that can be computed from the argument:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
    int s = ((bits >> 63) == 0) ? 1 : -1;
    int e = (int)((bits >> 52) & 0x7ffL);
    long m = (e == 0) ?
                    (bits & 0xfffffffffffffL) << 1 :
                    (bits & 0xfffffffffffffL) | 0x10000000000000L;
    ```

    Then the floating-point result equals the value of the mathematical
    expression *s*·*m*·2*e*-1075.

    Note that this method may not be able to return a
    `double` NaN with exactly same bit pattern as the
    `long` argument. IEEE 754 distinguishes between two
    kinds of NaNs, quiet NaNs and *signaling NaNs*. The
    differences between the two kinds of NaN are generally not
    visible in Java. Arithmetic operations on signaling NaNs turn
    them into quiet NaNs with a different, but often similar, bit
    pattern. However, on some processors merely copying a
    signaling NaN also performs that conversion. In particular,
    copying a signaling NaN to return it to the calling method
    may perform this conversion. So `longBitsToDouble`
    may not be able to return a `double` with a
    signaling NaN bit pattern. Consequently, for some
    `long` values,
    `doubleToRawLongBits(longBitsToDouble(start))` may
    *not* equal `start`. Moreover, which
    particular bit patterns represent signaling NaNs is platform
    dependent; although all NaN bit patterns, quiet or signaling,
    must be in the NaN range identified above.

    Parameters:
    :   `bits` - any `long` integer.

    Returns:
    :   the `double` floating-point value with the same
        bit pattern.
  + ### compareTo

    public int compareTo([Double](Double.md "class in java.lang") anotherDouble)

    Compares two `Double` objects numerically.
    This method imposes a total order on `Double` objects
    with two differences compared to the incomplete order defined by
    the Java language numerical comparison operators (`<, <=,
    ==, >=, >`) on `double` values.
    - A NaN is *unordered* with respect to other
      values and unequal to itself under the comparison
      operators. This method chooses to define `Double.NaN` to be equal to itself and greater than all
      other `double` values (including `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`).- Positive zero and negative zero compare equal
        numerically, but are distinct and distinguishable values.
        This method chooses to define positive zero (`+0.0d`),
        to be greater than negative zero (`-0.0d`).This ensures that the *natural ordering* of `Double`
    objects imposed by this method is *consistent with
    equals*; see [this
    discussion](#equivalenceRelation) for details of floating-point comparison and
    ordering.

    Specified by:
    :   `compareTo` in interface `Comparable<Double>`

    Parameters:
    :   `anotherDouble` - the `Double` to be compared.

    Returns:
    :   the value `0` if `anotherDouble` is
        numerically equal to this `Double`; a value
        less than `0` if this `Double`
        is numerically less than `anotherDouble`;
        and a value greater than `0` if this
        `Double` is numerically greater than
        `anotherDouble`.

    Since:
    :   1.2
  + ### compare

    public static int compare(double d1,
    double d2)

    Compares the two specified `double` values. The sign
    of the integer value returned is the same as that of the
    integer that would be returned by the call:

    ```
        Double.valueOf(d1).compareTo(Double.valueOf(d2))
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `d1` - the first `double` to compare
    :   `d2` - the second `double` to compare

    Returns:
    :   the value `0` if `d1` is
        numerically equal to `d2`; a value less than
        `0` if `d1` is numerically less than
        `d2`; and a value greater than `0`
        if `d1` is numerically greater than
        `d2`.

    Since:
    :   1.4
  + ### sum

    public static double sum(double a,
    double b)
