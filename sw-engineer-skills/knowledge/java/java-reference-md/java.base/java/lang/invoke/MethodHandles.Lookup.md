public static final class MethodHandles.Lookup
extends [Object](../Object.md "class in java.lang")

A *lookup object* is a factory for creating method handles,
when the creation requires access checking.
Method handles do not perform
access checks when they are called, but rather when they are created.
Therefore, method handle access
restrictions must be enforced when a method handle is created.
The caller class against which those restrictions are enforced
is known as the [lookup class](#lookupClass()).

A lookup class which needs to create method handles will call
[`MethodHandles.lookup`](MethodHandles.md#lookup()) to create a factory for itself.
When the `Lookup` factory object is created, the identity of the lookup class is
determined, and securely stored in the `Lookup` object.
The lookup class (or its delegates) may then use factory methods
on the `Lookup` object to create method handles for access-checked members.
This includes all methods, constructors, and fields which are allowed to the lookup class,
even private ones.

## Lookup Factory Methods

The factory methods on a `Lookup` object correspond to all major
use cases for methods, constructors, and fields.
Each method handle created by a factory method is the functional
equivalent of a particular *bytecode behavior*.
(Bytecode behaviors are described in section of
the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)
Here is a summary of the correspondence between these factory methods and
the behavior of the resulting method handles:

lookup method behaviors

| lookup expression | member | bytecode behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`lookup.findGetter(C.class,"f",FT.class)`](#findGetter(java.lang.Class,java.lang.String,java.lang.Class)) | `FT f;` | `(T) this.f;` |
| [`lookup.findStaticGetter(C.class,"f",FT.class)`](#findStaticGetter(java.lang.Class,java.lang.String,java.lang.Class)) | `static` `FT f;` | `(FT) C.f;` |
| [`lookup.findSetter(C.class,"f",FT.class)`](#findSetter(java.lang.Class,java.lang.String,java.lang.Class)) | `FT f;` | `this.f = x;` |
| [`lookup.findStaticSetter(C.class,"f",FT.class)`](#findStaticSetter(java.lang.Class,java.lang.String,java.lang.Class)) | `static` `FT f;` | `C.f = arg;` |
| [`lookup.findVirtual(C.class,"m",MT)`](#findVirtual(java.lang.Class,java.lang.String,java.lang.invoke.MethodType)) | `T m(A*);` | `(T) this.m(arg*);` |
| [`lookup.findStatic(C.class,"m",MT)`](#findStatic(java.lang.Class,java.lang.String,java.lang.invoke.MethodType)) | `static` `T m(A*);` | `(T) C.m(arg*);` |
| [`lookup.findSpecial(C.class,"m",MT,this.class)`](#findSpecial(java.lang.Class,java.lang.String,java.lang.invoke.MethodType,java.lang.Class)) | `T m(A*);` | `(T) super.m(arg*);` |
| [`lookup.findConstructor(C.class,MT)`](#findConstructor(java.lang.Class,java.lang.invoke.MethodType)) | `C(A*);` | `new C(arg*);` |
| [`lookup.unreflectGetter(aField)`](#unreflectGetter(java.lang.reflect.Field)) | (`static`)? `FT f;` | `(FT) aField.get(thisOrNull);` |
| [`lookup.unreflectSetter(aField)`](#unreflectSetter(java.lang.reflect.Field)) | (`static`)? `FT f;` | `aField.set(thisOrNull, arg);` |
| [`lookup.unreflect(aMethod)`](#unreflect(java.lang.reflect.Method)) | (`static`)? `T m(A*);` | `(T) aMethod.invoke(thisOrNull, arg*);` |
| [`lookup.unreflectConstructor(aConstructor)`](#unreflectConstructor(java.lang.reflect.Constructor)) | `C(A*);` | `(C) aConstructor.newInstance(arg*);` |
| [`lookup.unreflectSpecial(aMethod,this.class)`](#unreflectSpecial(java.lang.reflect.Method,java.lang.Class)) | `T m(A*);` | `(T) super.m(arg*);` |
| [`lookup.findClass("C")`](#findClass(java.lang.String)) | `class C { ... }` | `C.class;` |

Here, the type `C` is the class or interface being searched for a member,
documented as a parameter named `refc` in the lookup methods.
The method type `MT` is composed from the return type `T`
and the sequence of argument types `A*`.
The constructor also has a sequence of argument types `A*` and
is deemed to return the newly-created object of type `C`.
Both `MT` and the field type `FT` are documented as a parameter named `type`.
The formal parameter `this` stands for the self-reference of type `C`;
if it is present, it is always the leading argument to the method handle invocation.
(In the case of some `protected` members, `this` may be
restricted in type to the lookup class; see below.)
The name `arg` stands for all the other method handle arguments.
In the code examples for the Core Reflection API, the name `thisOrNull`
stands for a null reference if the accessed method or field is static,
and `this` otherwise.
The names `aMethod`, `aField`, and `aConstructor` stand
for reflective objects corresponding to the given members declared in type `C`.

The bytecode behavior for a `findClass` operation is a load of a constant class,
as if by `ldc CONSTANT_Class`.
The behavior is represented, not as a method handle, but directly as a `Class` constant.

In cases where the given member is of variable arity (i.e., a method or constructor)
the returned method handle will also be of [variable arity](MethodHandle.md#asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class)).
In all other cases, the returned method handle will be of fixed arity.

*Discussion:*
The equivalence between looked-up method handles and underlying
class members and bytecode behaviors
can break down in a few ways:

* If `C` is not symbolically accessible from the lookup class's loader,
  the lookup can still succeed, even when there is no equivalent
  Java expression or bytecoded constant.* Likewise, if `T` or `MT`
    is not symbolically accessible from the lookup class's loader,
    the lookup can still succeed.
    For example, lookups for `MethodHandle.invokeExact` and
    `MethodHandle.invoke` will always succeed, regardless of requested type.* If there is a security manager installed, it can forbid the lookup
      on various grounds ([see below](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#secmgr)).
      By contrast, the `ldc` instruction on a `CONSTANT_MethodHandle`
      constant is not subject to security manager checks.* If the looked-up method has a
        [very large arity](MethodHandle.md#maxarity),
        the method handle creation may fail with an
        `IllegalArgumentException`, due to the method handle type having
        [too many parameters.](MethodHandle.md#maxarity)

## Access checking

Access checks are applied in the factory methods of `Lookup`,
when a method handle is created.
This is a key difference from the Core Reflection API, since
[`java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke`](../reflect/Method.md#invoke(java.lang.Object,java.lang.Object...))
performs access checking against every caller, on every call.

All access checks start from a `Lookup` object, which
compares its recorded lookup class against all requests to
create method handles.
A single `Lookup` object can be used to create any number
of access-checked method handles, all checked against a single
lookup class.

A `Lookup` object can be shared with other trusted code,
such as a metaobject protocol.
A shared `Lookup` object delegates the capability
to create method handles on private members of the lookup class.
Even if privileged code uses the `Lookup` object,
the access checking is confined to the privileges of the
original lookup class.

A lookup can fail, because
the containing class is not accessible to the lookup class, or
because the desired class member is missing, or because the
desired class member is not accessible to the lookup class, or
because the lookup object is not trusted enough to access the member.
In the case of a field setter function on a `final` field,
finality enforcement is treated as a kind of access control,
and the lookup will fail, except in special cases of
[`Lookup.unreflectSetter`](#unreflectSetter(java.lang.reflect.Field)).
In any of these cases, a `ReflectiveOperationException` will be
thrown from the attempted lookup. The exact class will be one of
the following:

* NoSuchMethodException — if a method is requested but does not exist* NoSuchFieldException — if a field is requested but does not exist* IllegalAccessException — if the member exists but an access check fails

In general, the conditions under which a method handle may be
looked up for a method `M` are no more restrictive than the conditions
under which the lookup class could have compiled, verified, and resolved a call to `M`.
Where the JVM would raise exceptions like `NoSuchMethodError`,
a method handle lookup will generally raise a corresponding
checked exception, such as `NoSuchMethodException`.
And the effect of invoking the method handle resulting from the lookup
is [exactly equivalent](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#equiv)
to executing the compiled, verified, and resolved call to `M`.
The same point is true of fields and constructors.

*Discussion:*
Access checks only apply to named and reflected methods,
constructors, and fields.
Other method handle creation methods, such as
[`MethodHandle.asType`](MethodHandle.md#asType(java.lang.invoke.MethodType)),
do not require any access checks, and are used
independently of any `Lookup` object.

If the desired member is `protected`, the usual JVM rules apply,
including the requirement that the lookup class must either be in the
same package as the desired member, or must inherit that member.
(See the Java Virtual Machine Specification, sections , , and .)
In addition, if the desired member is a non-static field or method
in a different package, the resulting method handle may only be applied
to objects of the lookup class or one of its subclasses.
This requirement is enforced by narrowing the type of the leading
`this` parameter from `C`
(which will necessarily be a superclass of the lookup class)
to the lookup class itself.

The JVM imposes a similar requirement on `invokespecial` instruction,
that the receiver argument must match both the resolved method *and*
the current class. Again, this requirement is enforced by narrowing the
type of the leading parameter to the resulting method handle.
(See the Java Virtual Machine Specification, section .)

The JVM represents constructors and static initializer blocks as internal methods
with special names (["<init>"](../constant/ConstantDescs.md#INIT_NAME) and ["<clinit>"](../constant/ConstantDescs.md#CLASS_INIT_NAME)).
The internal syntax of invocation instructions allows them to refer to such internal
methods as if they were normal methods, but the JVM bytecode verifier rejects them.
A lookup of such an internal method will produce a `NoSuchMethodException`.

If the relationship between nested types is expressed directly through the
`NestHost` and `NestMembers` attributes
(see the Java Virtual Machine Specification, sections and ),
then the associated `Lookup` object provides direct access to
the lookup class and all of its nestmates
(see [`Class.getNestHost`](../Class.md#getNestHost())).
Otherwise, access between nested classes is obtained by the Java compiler creating
a wrapper method to access a private method of another class in the same nest.
For example, a nested class `C.D`
can access private members within other related classes such as
`C`, `C.D.E`, or `C.B`,
but the Java compiler may need to generate wrapper methods in
those related classes. In such cases, a `Lookup` object on
`C.E` would be unable to access those private members.
A workaround for this limitation is the [`Lookup.in`](#in(java.lang.Class)) method,
which can transform a lookup on `C.E` into one on any of those other
classes, without special elevation of privilege.

The accesses permitted to a given lookup object may be limited,
according to its set of [`lookupModes`](#lookupModes()),
to a subset of members normally accessible to the lookup class.
For example, the [`publicLookup`](MethodHandles.md#publicLookup())
method produces a lookup object which is only allowed to access
public members in public classes of exported packages.
The caller sensitive method [`lookup`](MethodHandles.md#lookup())
produces a lookup object with full capabilities relative to
its caller class, to emulate all supported bytecode behaviors.
Also, the [`Lookup.in`](#in(java.lang.Class)) method may produce a lookup object
with fewer access modes than the original lookup object.

*Discussion of private and module access:*
We say that a lookup has *private access*
if its [lookup modes](#lookupModes())
include the possibility of accessing `private` members
(which includes the private members of nestmates).
As documented in the relevant methods elsewhere,
only lookups with private access possess the following capabilities:

* access private fields, methods, and constructors of the lookup class and its nestmates* create method handles which [`emulate invokespecial`](#findSpecial(java.lang.Class,java.lang.String,java.lang.invoke.MethodType,java.lang.Class)) instructions* avoid [package access checks](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#secmgr)
      for classes accessible to the lookup class* create [`delegated lookup objects`](#in(java.lang.Class)) which have private access to other classes
        within the same package member

Similarly, a lookup with module access ensures that the original lookup creator was
a member in the same module as the lookup class.

Private and module access are independently determined modes; a lookup may have
either or both or neither. A lookup which possesses both access modes is said to
possess [full privilege access](#hasFullPrivilegeAccess()).

A lookup with *original access* ensures that this lookup is created by
the original lookup class and the bootstrap method invoked by the VM.
Such a lookup with original access also has private and module access
which has the following additional capability:

* create method handles which invoke [caller sensitive](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#callsens) methods,
  such as `Class.forName`* obtain the [class data](MethodHandles.md#classData(java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup,java.lang.String,java.lang.Class)) associated with the lookup class

Each of these permissions is a consequence of the fact that a lookup object
with private access can be securely traced back to an originating class,
whose [bytecode behaviors](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#equiv) and Java language access permissions
can be reliably determined and emulated by method handles.

## Cross-module lookups

When a lookup class in one module `M1` accesses a class in another module
`M2`, extra access checking is performed beyond the access mode bits.
A `Lookup` with [`PUBLIC`](#PUBLIC) mode and a lookup class in `M1`
can access public types in `M2` when `M2` is readable to `M1`
and when the type is in a package of `M2` that is exported to
at least `M1`.

A `Lookup` on `C` can also *teleport* to a target class
via [`Lookup.in`](#in(java.lang.Class)) and [`MethodHandles.privateLookupIn`](MethodHandles.md#privateLookupIn(java.lang.Class,java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup)) methods.
Teleporting across modules will always record the original lookup class as
the *[previous lookup class](#previousLookupClass())*
and drops [`MODULE`](#MODULE) access.
If the target class is in the same module as the lookup class `C`,
then the target class becomes the new lookup class
and there is no change to the previous lookup class.
If the target class is in a different module from `M1` (`C`'s module),
`C` becomes the new previous lookup class
and the target class becomes the new lookup class.
In that case, if there was already a previous lookup class in `M0`,
and it differs from `M1` and `M2`, then the resulting lookup
drops all privileges.
For example,

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

```
Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.lookup();   // in class C
Lookup lookup2 = lookup.in(D.class);
MethodHandle mh = lookup2.findStatic(E.class, "m", MT);
```

The [`MethodHandles.lookup()`](MethodHandles.md#lookup()) factory method produces a `Lookup` object
with `null` previous lookup class.
[`lookup.in(D.class)`](#in(java.lang.Class)) transforms the `lookup` on class `C`
to class `D` without elevation of privileges.
If `C` and `D` are in the same module,
`lookup2` records `D` as the new lookup class and keeps the
same previous lookup class as the original `lookup`, or
`null` if not present.

When a `Lookup` teleports from a class
in one nest to another nest, `PRIVATE` access is dropped.
When a `Lookup` teleports from a class in one package to
another package, `PACKAGE` access is dropped.
When a `Lookup` teleports from a class in one module to another module,
`MODULE` access is dropped.
Teleporting across modules drops the ability to access non-exported classes
in both the module of the new lookup class and the module of the old lookup class
and the resulting `Lookup` remains only `PUBLIC` access.
A `Lookup` can teleport back and forth to a class in the module of
the lookup class and the module of the previous class lookup.
Teleporting across modules can only decrease access but cannot increase it.
Teleporting to some third module drops all accesses.

In the above example, if `C` and `D` are in different modules,
`lookup2` records `D` as its lookup class and
`C` as its previous lookup class and `lookup2` has only
`PUBLIC` access. `lookup2` can teleport to other class in
`C`'s module and `D`'s module.
If class `E` is in a third module, `lookup2.in(E.class)` creates
a `Lookup` on `E` with no access and `lookup2`'s lookup
class `D` is recorded as its previous lookup class.

Teleporting across modules restricts access to the public types that
both the lookup class and the previous lookup class can equally access
(see below).

[`MethodHandles.privateLookupIn(T.class, lookup)`](MethodHandles.md#privateLookupIn(java.lang.Class,java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup))
can be used to teleport a `lookup` from class `C` to class `T`
and produce a new `Lookup` with [private access](#privacc)
if the lookup class is allowed to do *deep reflection* on `T`.
The `lookup` must have [`MODULE`](#MODULE) and [`PRIVATE`](#PRIVATE) access
to call `privateLookupIn`.
A `lookup` on `C` in module `M1` is allowed to do deep reflection
on all classes in `M1`. If `T` is in `M1`, `privateLookupIn`
produces a new `Lookup` on `T` with full capabilities.
A `lookup` on `C` is also allowed
to do deep reflection on `T` in another module `M2` if
`M1` reads `M2` and `M2` [`opens`](../Module.md#isOpen(java.lang.String,java.lang.Module))
the package containing `T` to at least `M1`.
`T` becomes the new lookup class and `C` becomes the new previous
lookup class and `MODULE` access is dropped from the resulting `Lookup`.
The resulting `Lookup` can be used to do member lookup or teleport
to another lookup class by calling [`Lookup::in`](#in(java.lang.Class)). But
it cannot be used to obtain another private `Lookup` by calling
[`privateLookupIn`](MethodHandles.md#privateLookupIn(java.lang.Class,java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup))
because it has no `MODULE` access.

The `Lookup` object returned by `privateLookupIn` is allowed to
[define classes](#defineClass(byte%5B%5D)) in the runtime package
of `T`. Extreme caution should be taken when opening a package
to another module as such defined classes have the same full privilege
access as other members in `M2`.

## Cross-module access checks

A `Lookup` with [`PUBLIC`](#PUBLIC) or with [`UNCONDITIONAL`](#UNCONDITIONAL) mode
allows cross-module access. The access checking is performed with respect
to both the lookup class and the previous lookup class if present.

A `Lookup` with [`UNCONDITIONAL`](#UNCONDITIONAL) mode can access public type
in all modules when the type is in a package that is [exported unconditionally](../Module.md#isExported(java.lang.String)).

If a `Lookup` on `LC` in `M1` has no previous lookup class,
the lookup with [`PUBLIC`](#PUBLIC) mode can access all public types in modules
that are readable to `M1` and the type is in a package that is exported
at least to `M1`.

If a `Lookup` on `LC` in `M1` has a previous lookup class
`PLC` on `M0`, the lookup with [`PUBLIC`](#PUBLIC) mode can access
the intersection of all public types that are accessible to `M1`
with all public types that are accessible to `M0`. `M0`
reads `M1` and hence the set of accessible types includes:

* unconditional-exported packages from `M1`
* unconditional-exported packages from `M0` if `M1` reads `M0`
* unconditional-exported packages from a third module `M2`if both `M0`
  and `M1` read `M2`
* qualified-exported packages from `M1` to `M0`
* qualified-exported packages from `M0` to `M1` if `M1` reads `M0`
* qualified-exported packages from a third module `M2` to both `M0` and
  `M1` if both `M0` and `M1` read `M2`

## Access modes

The table below shows the access modes of a `Lookup` produced by
any of the following factory or transformation methods:

* [`MethodHandles::lookup`](MethodHandles.md#lookup())
* [`MethodHandles::publicLookup`](MethodHandles.md#publicLookup())
* [`MethodHandles::privateLookupIn`](MethodHandles.md#privateLookupIn(java.lang.Class,java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup))
* [`Lookup::in`](#in(java.lang.Class))
* [`Lookup::dropLookupMode`](#dropLookupMode(int))

Notes:

* Class `C` and class `C1` are in module `M1`,
  but `D` and `D2` are in module `M2`, and `E`
  is in module `M3`. `X` stands for class which is inaccessible
  to the lookup. `ANY` stands for any of the example lookups.
* `ORI` indicates [`ORIGINAL`](#ORIGINAL) bit set,
  `PRO` indicates [`PROTECTED`](#PROTECTED) bit set,
  `PRI` indicates [`PRIVATE`](#PRIVATE) bit set,
  `PAC` indicates [`PACKAGE`](#PACKAGE) bit set,
  `MOD` indicates [`MODULE`](#MODULE) bit set,
  `1R` and `2R` indicate [`PUBLIC`](#PUBLIC) bit set,
  `U` indicates [`UNCONDITIONAL`](#UNCONDITIONAL) bit set,
  `IAE` indicates `IllegalAccessException` thrown.
* Public access comes in three kinds:
  + unconditional (`U`): the lookup assumes readability.
    The lookup has `null` previous lookup class.+ one-module-reads (`1R`): the module access checking is
      performed with respect to the lookup class. The lookup has `null`
      previous lookup class.+ two-module-reads (`2R`): the module access checking is
        performed with respect to the lookup class and the previous lookup class.
        The lookup has a non-null previous lookup class which is in a
        different module from the current lookup class.* Any attempt to reach a third module loses all access.
  * If a target class `X` is not accessible to `Lookup::in`
    all access modes are dropped.

## Security manager interactions

Although bytecode instructions can only refer to classes in
a related class loader, this API can search for methods in any
class, as long as a reference to its `Class` object is
available. Such cross-loader references are also possible with the
Core Reflection API, and are impossible to bytecode instructions
such as `invokestatic` or `getfield`.
There is a [security manager API](../SecurityManager.md "class in java.lang")
to allow applications to check such cross-loader references.
These checks apply to both the `MethodHandles.Lookup` API
and the Core Reflection API
(as found on [`Class`](../Class.md "class in java.lang")).

If a security manager is present, member and class lookups are subject to
additional checks.
From one to three calls are made to the security manager.
Any of these calls can refuse access by throwing a
[`SecurityException`](../SecurityException.md "class in java.lang").
Define `smgr` as the security manager,
`lookc` as the lookup class of the current lookup object,
`refc` as the containing class in which the member
is being sought, and `defc` as the class in which the
member is actually defined.
(If a class or other type is being accessed,
the `refc` and `defc` values are the class itself.)
The value `lookc` is defined as *not present*
if the current lookup object does not have
[full privilege access](#hasFullPrivilegeAccess()).
The calls are made according to the following rules:

* **Step 1:**
  If `lookc` is not present, or if its class loader is not
  the same as or an ancestor of the class loader of `refc`,
  then [`smgr.checkPackageAccess(refcPkg)`](../SecurityManager.md#checkPackageAccess(java.lang.String)) is called,
  where `refcPkg` is the package of `refc`.* **Step 2a:**
    If the retrieved member is not public and
    `lookc` is not present, then
    [`smgr.checkPermission`](../SecurityManager.md#checkPermission(java.security.Permission))
    with `RuntimePermission("accessDeclaredMembers")` is called.* **Step 2b:**
      If the retrieved class has a `null` class loader,
      and `lookc` is not present, then
      [`smgr.checkPermission`](../SecurityManager.md#checkPermission(java.security.Permission))
      with `RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")` is called.* **Step 3:**
        If the retrieved member is not public,
        and if `lookc` is not present,
        and if `defc` and `refc` are different,
        then [`smgr.checkPackageAccess(defcPkg)`](../SecurityManager.md#checkPackageAccess(java.lang.String)) is called,
        where `defcPkg` is the package of `defc`.

Security checks are performed after other access checks have passed.
Therefore, the above rules presuppose a member or class that is public,
or else that is being accessed from a lookup class that has
rights to access the member or class.

If a security manager is present and the current lookup object does not have
[full privilege access](#hasFullPrivilegeAccess()), then
[`defineClass`](#defineClass(byte%5B%5D)),
[`defineHiddenClass`](#defineHiddenClass(byte%5B%5D,boolean,java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup.ClassOption...)),
[`defineHiddenClassWithClassData`](#defineHiddenClassWithClassData(byte%5B%5D,java.lang.Object,boolean,java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup.ClassOption...))
calls [`smgr.checkPermission`](../SecurityManager.md#checkPermission(java.security.Permission))
with `RuntimePermission("defineClass")`.

## Caller sensitive methods

A small number of Java methods have a special property called caller sensitivity.
A *caller-sensitive* method can behave differently depending on the
identity of its immediate caller.

If a method handle for a caller-sensitive method is requested,
the general rules for [bytecode behaviors](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#equiv) apply,
but they take account of the lookup class in a special way.
The resulting method handle behaves as if it were called
from an instruction contained in the lookup class,
so that the caller-sensitive method detects the lookup class.
(By contrast, the invoker of the method handle is disregarded.)
Thus, in the case of caller-sensitive methods,
different lookup classes may give rise to
differently behaving method handles.

In cases where the lookup object is
[`publicLookup()`](MethodHandles.md#publicLookup()),
or some other lookup object without the
[original access](#ORIGINAL),
the lookup class is disregarded.
In such cases, no caller-sensitive method handle can be created,
access is forbidden, and the lookup fails with an
`IllegalAccessException`.

*Discussion:*
For example, the caller-sensitive method
[`Class.forName(x)`](../Class.md#forName(java.lang.String))
can return varying classes or throw varying exceptions,
depending on the class loader of the class that calls it.
A public lookup of `Class.forName` will fail, because
there is no reasonable way to determine its bytecode behavior.

If an application caches method handles for broad sharing,
it should use `publicLookup()` to create them.
If there is a lookup of `Class.forName`, it will fail,
and the application must take appropriate action in that case.
It may be that a later lookup, perhaps during the invocation of a
bootstrap method, can incorporate the specific identity
of the caller, making the method accessible.

The function `MethodHandles.lookup` is caller sensitive
so that there can be a secure foundation for lookups.
Nearly all other methods in the JSR 292 API rely on lookup
objects to check access requests.

    access checks are performed against both the lookup class and the previous lookup class.

    The class implies a maximum level of access permission,

    and [ORIGINAL (0x40)](#ORIGINAL).

    A freshly-created lookup object
    on the [caller's class](MethodHandles.md#lookup()) has
    all possible bits set, except `UNCONDITIONAL`.
    A lookup object on a new lookup class
    [created from a previous lookup object](#in(java.lang.Class))
    may have some mode bits set to zero.
    Mode bits can also be
    [directly cleared](#dropLookupMode(int)).
    Once cleared, mode bits cannot be restored from the downgraded lookup object.
    The purpose of this is to restrict access via the new lookup object,
    so that it can access only names which can be reached by the original
    lookup object, and also by the new lookup class.

    Returns:

  + ### in

    public [MethodHandles.Lookup](MethodHandles.Lookup.md "class in java.lang.invoke") in([Class](../Class.md "class in java.lang")<?> requestedLookupClass)

    Creates a lookup on the specified new lookup class.
    The resulting object will report the specified
    class as its own [`lookupClass`](#lookupClass()).

    However, the resulting `Lookup` object is guaranteed
    to have no more access capabilities than the original.
    In particular, access capabilities can be lost as follows:
    - If the new lookup class is different from the old lookup class,
      i.e. [`ORIGINAL`](#ORIGINAL) access is lost.- If the new lookup class is in a different module from the old one,
        i.e. [`MODULE`](#MODULE) access is lost.- If the new lookup class is in a different package
          than the old one, protected and default (package) members will not be accessible,
          i.e. [`PROTECTED`](#PROTECTED) and [`PACKAGE`](#PACKAGE) access are lost.- If the new lookup class is not within the same package member
            as the old one, private members will not be accessible, and protected members
            will not be accessible by virtue of inheritance,
            i.e. [`PRIVATE`](#PRIVATE) access is lost.
            (Protected members may continue to be accessible because of package sharing.)- If the new lookup class is not
              [accessible](#accessClass(java.lang.Class)) to this lookup,
              then no members, not even public members, will be accessible
              i.e. all access modes are lost.- If the new lookup class, the old lookup class and the previous lookup class
                are all in different modules i.e. teleporting to a third module,
                all access modes are lost.

    The new previous lookup class is chosen as follows:
    - If the new lookup object has [`UNCONDITIONAL`](#UNCONDITIONAL) bit,
      the new previous lookup class is `null`.- If the new lookup class is in the same module as the old lookup class,
        the new previous lookup class is the old previous lookup class.- If the new lookup class is in a different module from the old lookup class,
          the new previous lookup class is the old lookup class.

    The resulting lookup's capabilities for loading classes
    (used during [`findClass(java.lang.String)`](#findClass(java.lang.String)) invocations)
    are determined by the lookup class' loader,
    which may change due to this operation.

    Parameters:
    :   `requestedLookupClass` - the desired lookup class for the new lookup object

    Returns:
    :   a lookup object which reports the desired lookup class, or the same object
        if there is no change

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `requestedLookupClass` is a primitive type or void or array class
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the argument is null

  + ### dropLookupMode

    public [MethodHandles.Lookup](MethodHandles.Lookup.md "class in java.lang.invoke") dropLookupMode(int modeToDrop)

    Creates a lookup on the same lookup class which this lookup object
    finds members, but with a lookup mode that has lost the given lookup mode.
    The lookup mode to drop is one of [`PUBLIC`](#PUBLIC), [`MODULE`](#MODULE), [`PACKAGE`](#PACKAGE), [`PROTECTED`](#PROTECTED),
    [`PRIVATE`](#PRIVATE), [`ORIGINAL`](#ORIGINAL), or
    [`UNCONDITIONAL`](#UNCONDITIONAL).

    If this lookup is a [public lookup](MethodHandles.md#publicLookup()),
    this lookup has `UNCONDITIONAL` mode set and it has no other mode set.
    When dropping `UNCONDITIONAL` on a public lookup then the resulting
    lookup has no access.

    If this lookup is not a public lookup, then the following applies
    regardless of its [lookup modes](#lookupModes()).
    [`PROTECTED`](#PROTECTED) and [`ORIGINAL`](#ORIGINAL) are always
    dropped and so the resulting lookup mode will never have these access
    capabilities. When dropping `PACKAGE`
    then the resulting lookup will not have `PACKAGE` or `PRIVATE`
    access. When dropping `MODULE` then the resulting lookup will not
    have `MODULE`, `PACKAGE`, or `PRIVATE` access.
    When dropping `PUBLIC` then the resulting lookup has no access.

    Parameters:
    :   `modeToDrop` - the lookup mode to drop

    Returns:
    :   a lookup object which lacks the indicated mode, or the same object if there is no change

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `modeToDrop` is not one of `PUBLIC`,
        `MODULE`, `PACKAGE`, `PROTECTED`, `PRIVATE`, `ORIGINAL`
        or `UNCONDITIONAL`

  + ### defineClass

    public [Class](../Class.md "class in java.lang")<?> defineClass(byte[] bytes)
    throws [IllegalAccessException](../IllegalAccessException.md "class in java.lang")

    Creates and links a class or interface from `bytes`
    with the same class loader and in the same runtime package and
    [protection domain](../../security/ProtectionDomain.md "class in java.security") as this lookup's
    [lookup class](#lookupClass()) as if calling
    [`ClassLoader::defineClass`](../ClassLoader.md#defineClass(java.lang.String,byte%5B%5D,int,int,java.security.ProtectionDomain)).

    The [lookup modes](#lookupModes()) for this lookup must include
    [`PACKAGE`](#PACKAGE) access as default (package) members will be
    accessible to the class. The `PACKAGE` lookup mode serves to authenticate
    that the lookup object was created by a caller in the runtime package (or derived
    from a lookup originally created by suitably privileged code to a target class in
    the runtime package).

    The `bytes` parameter is the class bytes of a valid class file (as defined
    by the *The Java Virtual Machine Specification*) with a class name in the
    same package as the lookup class.

    This method does not run the class initializer. The class initializer may
    run at a later time, as detailed in section 12.4 of the *The Java Language
    Specification*.

    If there is a security manager and this lookup does not have [full privilege access](#hasFullPrivilegeAccess()), its `checkPermission` method
    is first called to check `RuntimePermission("defineClass")`.

    Parameters:
    :   `bytes` - the class bytes

    Returns:
    :   the `Class` object for the class

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalAccessException` - if this lookup does not have `PACKAGE` access
    :   `ClassFormatError` - if `bytes` is not a `ClassFile` structure
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `bytes` denotes a class in a different package
        than the lookup class or `bytes` is not a class or interface
        (`ACC_MODULE` flag is set in the value of the `access_flags` item)
    :   `VerifyError` - if the newly created class cannot be verified
    :   `LinkageError` - if the newly created class cannot be linked for any other reason
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager is present and it
        [refuses access](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#secmgr)
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `bytes` is `null`

    throws [IllegalAccessException](../IllegalAccessException.md "class in java.lang")

    Creates a *hidden* class or interface from `bytes`,
    returning a `Lookup` on the newly created class or interface.

    Ordinarily, a class or interface `C` is created by a class loader,
    which either defines `C` directly or delegates to another class loader.
    A class loader defines `C` directly by invoking
    [`ClassLoader::defineClass`](../ClassLoader.md#defineClass(java.lang.String,byte%5B%5D,int,int,java.security.ProtectionDomain)), which causes the Java Virtual Machine
    to derive `C` from a purported representation in `class` file format.
    In situations where use of a class loader is undesirable, a class or interface
    `C` can be created by this method instead. This method is capable of
    defining `C`, and thereby creating it, without invoking
    `ClassLoader::defineClass`.
    Instead, this method defines `C` as if by arranging for
    the Java Virtual Machine to derive a nonarray class or interface `C`
    from a purported representation in `class` file format
    using the following rules:
    1. The [lookup modes](#lookupModes()) for this `Lookup`
       must include [full privilege](#hasFullPrivilegeAccess()) access.
       This level of access is needed to create `C` in the module
       of the lookup class of this `Lookup`.
    2. The purported representation in `bytes` must be a `ClassFile`
       structure (JVMS ) of a supported major and minor version.
       The major and minor version may differ from the `class` file version
       of the lookup class of this `Lookup`.
    3. The value of `this_class` must be a valid index in the
       `constant_pool` table, and the entry at that index must be a valid
       `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure. Let `N` be the binary name
       encoded in internal form that is specified by this structure. `N` must
       denote a class or interface in the same package as the lookup class.
    4. Let `CN` be the string `N + "." + <suffix>`,
       where `<suffix>` is an unqualified name.

       Let `newBytes` be the `ClassFile` structure given by
       `bytes` with an additional entry in the `constant_pool` table,
       indicating a `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure for `CN`, and
       where the `CONSTANT_Class_info` structure indicated by `this_class`
       refers to the new `CONSTANT_Utf8_info` structure.

       Let `L` be the defining class loader of the lookup class of this `Lookup`.

       `C` is derived with name `CN`, class loader `L`, and
       purported representation `newBytes` as if by the rules of JVMS ,
       with the following adjustments:
       - The constant indicated by `this_class` is permitted to specify a name
         that includes a single `"."` character, even though this is not a valid
         binary class or interface name in internal form.
       - The Java Virtual Machine marks `L` as the defining class loader of `C`,
         but no class loader is recorded as an initiating class loader of `C`.
       - `C` is considered to have the same runtime
         [package](../Class.md#getPackage()), [module](../Class.md#getModule())
         and [protection domain](../../security/ProtectionDomain.md "class in java.security")
         as the lookup class of this `Lookup`.- Let `GN` be the binary name obtained by taking `N`
           (a binary name encoded in internal form) and replacing ASCII forward slashes with
           ASCII periods. For the instance of [`Class`](../Class.md "class in java.lang") representing `C`:
           * [`Class.getName()`](../Class.md#getName()) returns the string `GN + "/" + <suffix>`,
             even though this is not a valid binary class or interface name.
           * [`Class.descriptorString()`](../Class.md#descriptorString()) returns the string
             `"L" + N + "." + <suffix> + ";"`,
             even though this is not a valid type descriptor name.
           * [`Class.describeConstable()`](../Class.md#describeConstable()) returns an empty optional as `C`
             cannot be described in [nominal form](../constant/ClassDesc.md "interface in java.lang.constant").

    After `C` is derived, it is linked by the Java Virtual Machine.
    Linkage occurs as specified in JVMS , with the following adjustments:
    - During verification, whenever it is necessary to load the class named
      `CN`, the attempt succeeds, producing class `C`. No request is
      made of any class loader.
    - On any attempt to resolve the entry in the run-time constant pool indicated
      by `this_class`, the symbolic reference is considered to be resolved to
      `C` and resolution always succeeds immediately.

    If the `initialize` parameter is `true`,
    then `C` is initialized by the Java Virtual Machine.

    The newly created class or interface `C` serves as the
    [lookup class](#lookupClass()) of the `Lookup` object
    returned by this method. `C` is *hidden* in the sense that
    no other class or interface can refer to `C` via a constant pool entry.
    That is, a hidden class or interface cannot be named as a supertype, a field type,
    a method parameter type, or a method return type by any other class.
    This is because a hidden class or interface does not have a binary name, so
    there is no internal form available to record in any class's constant pool.
    A hidden class or interface is not discoverable by [`Class.forName(String, boolean, ClassLoader)`](../Class.md#forName(java.lang.String,boolean,java.lang.ClassLoader)),
    [`ClassLoader.loadClass(String, boolean)`](../ClassLoader.md#loadClass(java.lang.String,boolean)), or [`findClass(String)`](#findClass(java.lang.String)), and
    is not [modifiable](../../../../java.instrument/java/lang/instrument/Instrumentation.md#isModifiableClass(java.lang.Class)) by Java agents or tool agents using the [JVM Tool Interface](../../../../../specs/jvmti.md).

    A class or interface created by
    [a class loader](../ClassLoader.md#defineClass(java.lang.String,byte%5B%5D,int,int,java.security.ProtectionDomain)) has a strong relationship with that class loader.
    That is, every `Class` object contains a reference to the `ClassLoader`
    that [defined it](../Class.md#getClassLoader()).
    This means that a class created by a class loader may be unloaded if and
    only if its defining loader is not reachable and thus may be reclaimed
    by a garbage collector (JLS ).
    By default, however, a hidden class or interface may be unloaded even if
    the class loader that is marked as its defining loader is
    [reachable](../ref/package-summary.md#reachability).
    This behavior is useful when a hidden class or interface serves multiple
    classes defined by arbitrary class loaders. In other cases, a hidden
    class or interface may be linked to a single class (or a small number of classes)
    with the same defining loader as the hidden class or interface.
    In such cases, where the hidden class or interface must be coterminous
    with a normal class or interface, the [`STRONG`](MethodHandles.Lookup.ClassOption.md#STRONG)
    option may be passed in `options`.
    This arranges for a hidden class to have the same strong relationship
    with the class loader marked as its defining loader,
    as a normal class or interface has with its own defining loader.
    If `STRONG` is not used, then the invoker of `defineHiddenClass`
    may still prevent a hidden class or interface from being
    unloaded by ensuring that the `Class` object is reachable.

    The unloading characteristics are set for each hidden class when it is
    defined, and cannot be changed later. An advantage of allowing hidden classes
    to be unloaded independently of the class loader marked as their defining loader
    is that a very large number of hidden classes may be created by an application.
    In contrast, if `STRONG` is used, then the JVM may run out of memory,
    just as if normal classes were created by class loaders.

    Classes and interfaces in a nest are allowed to have mutual access to
    their private members. The nest relationship is determined by
    the `NestHost` attribute (JVMS ) and
    the `NestMembers` attribute (JVMS ) in a `class` file.
    By default, a hidden class belongs to a nest consisting only of itself
    because a hidden class has no binary name.
    The [`NESTMATE`](MethodHandles.Lookup.ClassOption.md#NESTMATE) option can be passed in `options`
    to create a hidden class or interface `C` as a member of a nest.
    The nest to which `C` belongs is not based on any `NestHost` attribute
    in the `ClassFile` structure from which `C` was derived.
    Instead, the following rules determine the nest host of `C`:
    - If the nest host of the lookup class of this `Lookup` has previously
      been determined, then let `H` be the nest host of the lookup class.
      Otherwise, the nest host of the lookup class is determined using the
      algorithm in JVMS , yielding `H`.
    - The nest host of `C` is determined to be `H`,
      the nest host of the lookup class.

    A hidden class or interface may be serializable, but this requires a custom
    serialization mechanism in order to ensure that instances are properly serialized
    and deserialized. The default serialization mechanism supports only classes and
    interfaces that are discoverable by their class name.

    Parameters:
    :   `bytes` - the bytes that make up the class data,
        in the format of a valid `class` file as defined by
        The Java Virtual Machine Specification.

        the direct superclass of `C` is in fact an interface, or if any of the classes
        or interfaces named as direct superinterfaces of `C` are not in fact interfaces

    Creates a *hidden* class or interface from `bytes` with associated
    [class data](MethodHandles.md#classData(java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup,java.lang.String,java.lang.Class)),
    returning a `Lookup` on the newly created class or interface.

    This method is equivalent to calling
    [`defineHiddenClass(bytes, initialize, options)`](#defineHiddenClass(byte%5B%5D,boolean,java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup.ClassOption...))
    as if the hidden class is injected with a private static final *unnamed*
    field which is initialized with the given `classData` at
    the first instruction of the class initializer.
    The newly created class is linked by the Java Virtual Machine.

    The [`MethodHandles::classData`](MethodHandles.md#classData(java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup,java.lang.String,java.lang.Class))
    and [`MethodHandles::classDataAt`](MethodHandles.md#classDataAt(java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup,java.lang.String,java.lang.Class,int))
    methods can be used to retrieve the `classData`.

    Parameters:
    :   `bytes` - the class bytes
    :   `classData` - pre-initialized class data
    :   `initialize` - if `true` the class will be initialized.
    :   `options` - [class options](MethodHandles.Lookup.ClassOption.md "enum class in java.lang.invoke")

    Returns:

        with [original](#ORIGINAL) and
        [full privilege](#hasFullPrivilegeAccess()) access

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalAccessException` - if this `Lookup` does not have

    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager is present and it
        [refuses access](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#secmgr)
    :   `ClassFormatError` - if `bytes` is not a `ClassFile` structure
    :   `UnsupportedClassVersionError` - if `bytes` is not of a supported major or minor version
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `bytes` denotes a class in a different package

  + ### toString

    public [String](../String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Displays the name of the class from which lookups are to be made,
    followed by "/" and the name of the [previous lookup class](#previousLookupClass()) if present.
    (The name is the one reported by [`Class.getName`](../Class.md#getName()).)
    If there are restrictions on the access permitted to this lookup,
    this is indicated by adding a suffix to the class name, consisting
    of a slash and a keyword. The keyword represents the strongest
    allowed access, and is chosen as follows:
    - If no access is allowed, the suffix is "/noaccess".- If only unconditional access is allowed, the suffix is "/publicLookup".- If only public access to types in exported packages is allowed, the suffix is "/public".- If only public and module access are allowed, the suffix is "/module".- If public and package access are allowed, the suffix is "/package".- If public, package, and private access are allowed, the suffix is "/private".If none of the above cases apply, it is the case that
    [full privilege access](#hasFullPrivilegeAccess())
    (public, module, package, private, and protected) is allowed.
    In this case, no suffix is added.
    This is true only of an object obtained originally from
    [`MethodHandles.lookup`](MethodHandles.md#lookup()).
    Objects created by [`Lookup.in`](#in(java.lang.Class))
    always have restricted access, and will display a suffix.

    (It may seem strange that protected access should be
    stronger than private access. Viewed independently from
    package access, protected access is the first to be lost,
    because it requires a direct subclass relationship between
    caller and callee.)

    Overrides:

    public [MethodHandle](MethodHandle.md "class in java.lang.invoke") findStatic([Class](../Class.md "class in java.lang")<?> refc,
    [String](../String.md "class in java.lang") name,

    throws [NoSuchMethodException](../NoSuchMethodException.md "class in java.lang"),
    [IllegalAccessException](../IllegalAccessException.md "class in java.lang")

    Produces a method handle for a static method.
    The type of the method handle will be that of the method.
    (Since static methods do not take receivers, there is no
    additional receiver argument inserted into the method handle type,
    as there would be with [`findVirtual`](#findVirtual(java.lang.Class,java.lang.String,java.lang.invoke.MethodType)) or [`findSpecial`](#findSpecial(java.lang.Class,java.lang.String,java.lang.invoke.MethodType,java.lang.Class)).)
    The method and all its argument types must be accessible to the lookup object.

    The returned method handle will have
    [variable arity](MethodHandle.md#asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class)) if and only if
    the method's variable arity modifier bit (`0x0080`) is set.

    If the returned method handle is invoked, the method's class will
    be initialized, if it has not already been initialized.

    **Example:**

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

    ```
    import static java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.*;
    import static java.lang.invoke.MethodType.*;
    ...
    MethodHandle MH_asList = publicLookup().findStatic(Arrays.class,
      "asList", methodType(List.class, Object[].class));
    assertEquals("[x, y]", MH_asList.invoke("x", "y").toString());
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `refc` - the class from which the method is accessed
    :   `name` - the name of the method
    :   `type` - the type of the method

    Returns:
    :   the desired method handle

    Throws:
    :   `NoSuchMethodException` - if the method does not exist
    :   `IllegalAccessException` - if access checking fails,
        or if the method is not `static`,
        or if the method's variable arity modifier bit
        is set and `asVarargsCollector` fails
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager is present and it
        [refuses access](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#secmgr)
    :   `NullPointerException` - if any argument is null
  + ### findVirtual

    public [MethodHandle](MethodHandle.md "class in java.lang.invoke") findVirtual([Class](../Class.md "class in java.lang")<?> refc,
    [String](../String.md "class in java.lang") name,
    [MethodType](MethodType.md "class in java.lang.invoke") type)
    throws [NoSuchMethodException](../NoSuchMethodException.md "class in java.lang"),
    [IllegalAccessException](../IllegalAccessException.md "class in java.lang")

    Produces a method handle for a virtual method.
    The type of the method handle will be that of the method,
    with the receiver type (usually `refc`) prepended.
    The method and all its argument types must be accessible to the lookup object.

    When called, the handle will treat the first argument as a receiver
    and, for non-private methods, dispatch on the receiver's type to determine which method
    implementation to enter.
    For private methods the named method in `refc` will be invoked on the receiver.
    (The dispatching action is identical with that performed by an
    `invokevirtual` or `invokeinterface` instruction.)

    The first argument will be of type `refc` if the lookup
    class has full privileges to access the member. Otherwise
    the member must be `protected` and the first argument
    will be restricted in type to the lookup class.

    The returned method handle will have
    [variable arity](MethodHandle.md#asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class)) if and only if
    the method's variable arity modifier bit (`0x0080`) is set.

    Because of the general [equivalence](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#equiv) between `invokevirtual`
    instructions and method handles produced by `findVirtual`,
    if the class is `MethodHandle` and the name string is
    `invokeExact` or `invoke`, the resulting
    method handle is equivalent to one produced by
    [`MethodHandles.exactInvoker`](MethodHandles.md#exactInvoker(java.lang.invoke.MethodType)) or
    [`MethodHandles.invoker`](MethodHandles.md#invoker(java.lang.invoke.MethodType))
    with the same `type` argument.

    If the class is `VarHandle` and the name string corresponds to
    the name of a signature-polymorphic access mode method, the resulting
    method handle is equivalent to one produced by
    [`MethodHandles.varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode, java.lang.invoke.MethodType)`](MethodHandles.md#varHandleInvoker(java.lang.invoke.VarHandle.AccessMode,java.lang.invoke.MethodType)) with
    the access mode corresponding to the name string and with the same
    `type` arguments.

      .findConstructor(String.class, MT_newString);
    assertEquals("", (String) MH_newString.invokeExact());
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `refc` - the class or interface from which the method is accessed
    :   `name` - the name of the method
    :   `type` - the type of the method, with the receiver argument omitted

    Returns:
    :   the desired method handle

    Throws:
    :   `NoSuchMethodException` - if the method does not exist
    :   `IllegalAccessException` - if access checking fails,
        or if the method is `static`,
        or if the method's variable arity modifier bit
        is set and `asVarargsCollector` fails

    throws [NoSuchMethodException](../NoSuchMethodException.md "class in java.lang"),
    [IllegalAccessException](../IllegalAccessException.md "class in java.lang")

    Produces a method handle which creates an object and initializes it, using
    the constructor of the specified type.
    The parameter types of the method handle will be those of the constructor,
    while the return type will be a reference to the constructor's class.
    The constructor and all its argument types must be accessible to the lookup object.

    The requested type must have a return type of `void`.
    (This is consistent with the JVM's treatment of constructor type descriptors.)

    The returned method handle will have
    [variable arity](MethodHandle.md#asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class)) if and only if
    the constructor's variable arity modifier bit (`0x0080`) is set.

    If the returned method handle is invoked, the constructor's class will
    be initialized, if it has not already been initialized.

    public [Class](../Class.md "class in java.lang")<?> findClass([String](../String.md "class in java.lang") targetName)
    throws [ClassNotFoundException](../ClassNotFoundException.md "class in java.lang"),
    [IllegalAccessException](../IllegalAccessException.md "class in java.lang")

    Looks up a class by name from the lookup context defined by this `Lookup` object,
    [as if resolved](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#equiv) by an `ldc` instruction.
    Such a resolution, as specified in JVMS , attempts to locate and load the class,
    and then determines whether the class is accessible to this lookup object.

    For a class or an interface, the name is the [binary name](../ClassLoader.md#binary-name).
    For an array class of `n` dimensions, the name begins with `n` occurrences
    of `'['` and followed by the element type as encoded in the
    [table](../Class.md#nameFormat) specified in [`Class.getName()`](../Class.md#getName()).

    The lookup context here is determined by the [lookup class](#lookupClass()),
    its class loader, and the [lookup modes](#lookupModes()).

    Parameters:
    :   `targetName` - the [binary name](../ClassLoader.md#binary-name) of the class
        or the string representing an array class

    Returns:
    :   the requested class.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager is present and it
        [refuses access](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#secmgr)
    :   `LinkageError` - if the linkage fails
    :   `ClassNotFoundException` - if the class cannot be loaded by the lookup class' loader.
    :   `IllegalAccessException` - if the class is not accessible, using the allowed access
        modes.
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `targetName` is null

    throws [IllegalAccessException](../IllegalAccessException.md "class in java.lang")

    Ensures that `targetClass` has been initialized. The class
    to be initialized must be [accessible](#accessClass(java.lang.Class))
    to this `Lookup` object. This method causes `targetClass`
    to be initialized if it has not been already initialized,
    as specified in JVMS .

    This method returns when `targetClass` is fully initialized, or
    when `targetClass` is being initialized by the current thread.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the class to be initialized

    Parameters:
    :   `targetClass` - the class to be initialized

    Returns:
    :   `targetClass` that has been initialized, or that is being
        initialized by the current thread.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `targetClass` is a primitive type or `void`
        or array class
    :   `IllegalAccessException` - if `targetClass` is not
        [accessible](#accessClass(java.lang.Class)) to this lookup
    :   `ExceptionInInitializerError` - if the class initialization provoked
        by this method fails

  + ### accessClass

    public <T> [Class](../Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> accessClass([Class](../Class.md "class in java.lang")<T> targetClass)
    throws [IllegalAccessException](../IllegalAccessException.md "class in java.lang")

    Determines if a class can be accessed from the lookup context defined by
    this `Lookup` object. The static initializer of the class is not run.
    If `targetClass` is an array class, `targetClass` is accessible
    if the element type of the array class is accessible. Otherwise,
    `targetClass` is determined as accessible as follows.

    If `targetClass` is in the same module as the lookup class,
    the lookup class is `LC` in module `M1` and
    the previous lookup class is in module `M0` or
    `null` if not present,
    `targetClass` is accessible if and only if one of the following is true:
    - If this lookup has [`PRIVATE`](#PRIVATE) access, `targetClass` is
      `LC` or other class in the same nest of `LC`.
    - If this lookup has [`PACKAGE`](#PACKAGE) access, `targetClass` is
      in the same runtime package of `LC`.
    - If this lookup has [`MODULE`](#MODULE) access, `targetClass` is
      a public type in `M1`.
    - If this lookup has [`PUBLIC`](#PUBLIC) access, `targetClass` is
      a public type in a package exported by `M1` to at least `M0`
      if the previous lookup class is present; otherwise, `targetClass`
      is a public type in a package exported by `M1` unconditionally.

    Otherwise, if this lookup has [`UNCONDITIONAL`](#UNCONDITIONAL) access, this lookup
    can access public types in all modules when the type is in a package
    that is exported unconditionally.

    Otherwise, `targetClass` is in a different module from `lookupClass`,
    and if this lookup does not have `PUBLIC` access, `lookupClass`
    is inaccessible.

    Otherwise, if this lookup has no [previous lookup class](#previousLookupClass()),
    `M1` is the module containing `lookupClass` and
    `M2` is the module containing `targetClass`,
    then `targetClass` is accessible if and only if
    - `M1` reads `M2`, and- `targetClass` is public and in a package exported by
        `M2` at least to `M1`.

    Otherwise, if this lookup has a [previous lookup class](#previousLookupClass()),
    `M1` and `M2` are as before, and `M0` is the module
    containing the previous lookup class, then `targetClass` is accessible
    if and only if one of the following is true:
    - `targetClass` is in `M0` and `M1`
      reads `M0` and the type is
      in a package that is exported to at least `M1`.- `targetClass` is in `M1` and `M0`
        reads `M1` and the type is
        in a package that is exported to at least `M0`.- `targetClass` is in a third module `M2` and both `M0`
          and `M1` reads `M2` and the type is in a package
          that is exported to at least both `M0` and `M2`.

    Otherwise, `targetClass` is not accessible.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the class to be access-checked

    Parameters:
    :   `targetClass` - the class to be access-checked

    Returns:
    :   `targetClass` that has been access-checked

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalAccessException` - if the class is not accessible from the lookup class
        and previous lookup class, if present, using the allowed access modes.
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager is present and it
        [refuses access](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#secmgr)
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `targetClass` is `null`

    [String](../String.md "class in java.lang") name,
    [MethodType](MethodType.md "class in java.lang.invoke") type,
    [Class](../Class.md "class in java.lang")<?> specialCaller)
    throws [NoSuchMethodException](../NoSuchMethodException.md "class in java.lang"),
    [IllegalAccessException](../IllegalAccessException.md "class in java.lang")

    Produces an early-bound method handle for a virtual method.
    It will bypass checks for overriding methods on the receiver,
    [as if called](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#equiv) from an `invokespecial`
    instruction from within the explicitly specified `specialCaller`.
    The type of the method handle will be that of the method,
    with a suitably restricted receiver type prepended.
    (The receiver type will be `specialCaller` or a subtype.)
    The method and all its argument types must be accessible
    to the lookup object.

    Before method resolution,
    if the explicitly specified caller class is not identical with the
    lookup class, or if this lookup object does not have
    [private access](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#privacc)
    privileges, the access fails.

    The returned method handle will have
    [variable arity](MethodHandle.md#asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class)) if and only if
    the method's variable arity modifier bit (`0x0080`) is set.

    *(Note: JVM internal methods named ["<init>"](../constant/ConstantDescs.md#INIT_NAME)
    are not visible to this API,
    even though the `invokespecial` instruction can refer to them
    in special circumstances. Use [`findConstructor`](#findConstructor(java.lang.Class,java.lang.invoke.MethodType))
    to access instance initialization methods in a safe manner.)*

    **Example:**

    The type of the method handle will be that of the method,
    without any insertion of an additional receiver parameter.
    The given receiver will be bound into the method handle,
    so that every call to the method handle will invoke the
    requested method on the given receiver.

    The returned method handle will have
    [variable arity](MethodHandle.md#asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class)) if and only if
    the method's variable arity modifier bit (`0x0080`) is set

    This is almost equivalent to the following code, with some differences noted below:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

    ```
    import static java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.*;
    import static java.lang.invoke.MethodType.*;
    ...
    MethodHandle mh0 = lookup().findVirtual(defc, name, type);
    MethodHandle mh1 = mh0.bindTo(receiver);
    mh1 = mh1.withVarargs(mh0.isVarargsCollector());
    return mh1;
    ```

    where `defc` is either `receiver.getClass()` or a super
    type of that class, in which the requested method is accessible
    to the lookup class.
    (Unlike `bind`, `bindTo` does not preserve variable arity.
    Also, `bindTo` may throw a `ClassCastException` in instances where `bind` would
    throw an `IllegalAccessException`, as in the case where the member is `protected` and
    the receiver is restricted by `findVirtual` to the lookup class.)

    Parameters:
    :   `receiver` - the object from which the method is accessed
    :   `name` - the name of the method
    :   `type` - the type of the method, with the receiver argument omitted

    Returns:
    :   the desired method handle

    Throws:
    :   `NoSuchMethodException` - if the method does not exist
    :   `IllegalAccessException` - if access checking fails
        or if the method's variable arity modifier bit
        is set and `asVarargsCollector` fails
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager is present and it
        [refuses access](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#secmgr)
    :   `NullPointerException` - if any argument is null

  + ### unreflect

    public [MethodHandle](MethodHandle.md "class in java.lang.invoke") unreflect([Method](../reflect/Method.md "class in java.lang.reflect") m)
    throws [IllegalAccessException](../IllegalAccessException.md "class in java.lang")

    Makes a [direct method handle](MethodHandleInfo.md#directmh)
    to *m*, if the lookup class has permission.
    If *m* is non-static, the receiver argument is treated as an initial argument.
    If *m* is virtual, overriding is respected on every call.
    Unlike the Core Reflection API, exceptions are *not* wrapped.
    The type of the method handle will be that of the method,
    with the receiver type prepended (but only if it is non-static).
    If the method's `accessible` flag is not set,
    access checking is performed immediately on behalf of the lookup class.
    If *m* is not public, do not share the resulting handle with untrusted parties.

    The returned method handle will have
    [variable arity](MethodHandle.md#asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class)) if and only if
    the method's variable arity modifier bit (`0x0080`) is set.

    If *m* is static, and
    if the returned method handle is invoked, the method's class will
    be initialized, if it has not already been initialized.

    Parameters:
    :   `m` - the reflected method

    Returns:
    :   a method handle which can invoke the reflected method

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalAccessException` - if access checking fails
        or if the method's variable arity modifier bit
        is set and `asVarargsCollector` fails
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the argument is null
  + ### unreflectSpecial

    public [MethodHandle](MethodHandle.md "class in java.lang.invoke") unreflectSpecial([Method](../reflect/Method.md "class in java.lang.reflect") m,
    [Class](../Class.md "class in java.lang")<?> specialCaller)
    throws [IllegalAccessException](../IllegalAccessException.md "class in java.lang")

    Produces a method handle for a reflected method.
    It will bypass checks for overriding methods on the receiver,
    [as if called](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#equiv) from an `invokespecial`
    instruction from within the explicitly specified `specialCaller`.
    The type of the method handle will be that of the method,
    with a suitably restricted receiver type prepended.
    (The receiver type will be `specialCaller` or a subtype.)
    If the method's `accessible` flag is not set,
    access checking is performed immediately on behalf of the lookup class,
    as if `invokespecial` instruction were being linked.

    Before method resolution,
    if the explicitly specified caller class is not identical with the
    lookup class, or if this lookup object does not have
    [private access](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#privacc)
    privileges, the access fails.

    The returned method handle will have
    [variable arity](MethodHandle.md#asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class)) if and only if
    the method's variable arity modifier bit (`0x0080`) is set.

    Parameters:
    :   `m` - the reflected method
    :   `specialCaller` - the class nominally calling the method

    Returns:
    :   a method handle which can invoke the reflected method

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalAccessException` - if access checking fails,
        or if the method is `static`,
        or if the method's variable arity modifier bit
        is set and `asVarargsCollector` fails
    :   `NullPointerException` - if any argument is null
  + ### unreflectConstructor

    public [MethodHandle](MethodHandle.md "class in java.lang.invoke") unreflectConstructor([Constructor](../reflect/Constructor.md "class in java.lang.reflect")<?> c)
    throws [IllegalAccessException](../IllegalAccessException.md "class in java.lang")

    Produces a method handle for a reflected constructor.
    The type of the method handle will be that of the constructor,
    with the return type changed to the declaring class.
    The method handle will perform a `newInstance` operation,
    creating a new instance of the constructor's class on the
    arguments passed to the method handle.

    If the constructor's `accessible` flag is not set,
    access checking is performed immediately on behalf of the lookup class.

    The returned method handle will have
    [variable arity](MethodHandle.md#asVarargsCollector(java.lang.Class)) if and only if
    the constructor's variable arity modifier bit (`0x0080`) is set.

    If the returned method handle is invoked, the constructor's class will
    be initialized, if it has not already been initialized.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - the reflected constructor

    Returns:
    :   a method handle which can invoke the reflected constructor

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalAccessException` - if access checking fails
        or if the method's variable arity modifier bit
        is set and `asVarargsCollector` fails
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the argument is null
  + ### unreflectGetter

    public [MethodHandle](MethodHandle.md "class in java.lang.invoke") unreflectGetter([Field](../reflect/Field.md "class in java.lang.reflect") f)
    throws [IllegalAccessException](../IllegalAccessException.md "class in java.lang")

    Produces a method handle giving read access to a reflected field.
    The type of the method handle will have a return type of the field's
    value type.
    If the field is `static`, the method handle will take no arguments.
    Otherwise, its single argument will be the instance containing
    the field.
    If the `Field` object's `accessible` flag is not set,
    access checking is performed immediately on behalf of the lookup class.

    If the field is static, and
    if the returned method handle is invoked, the field's class will
    be initialized, if it has not already been initialized.

    Parameters:
    :   `f` - the reflected field

    Returns:
    :   a method handle which can load values from the reflected field

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalAccessException` - if access checking fails
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the argument is null
  + ### unreflectSetter

    public [MethodHandle](MethodHandle.md "class in java.lang.invoke") unreflectSetter([Field](../reflect/Field.md "class in java.lang.reflect") f)
    throws [IllegalAccessException](../IllegalAccessException.md "class in java.lang")

    Produces a method handle giving write access to a reflected field.
    The type of the method handle will have a void return type.
    If the field is `static`, the method handle will take a single
    argument, of the field's value type, the value to be stored.
    Otherwise, the two arguments will be the instance containing
    the field, and the value to be stored.
    If the `Field` object's `accessible` flag is not set,
    access checking is performed immediately on behalf of the lookup class.

    If the field is `final`, write access will not be
    allowed and access checking will fail, except under certain
    narrow circumstances documented for [`Field.set`](../reflect/Field.md#set(java.lang.Object,java.lang.Object)).
    A method handle is returned only if a corresponding call to
    the `Field` object's `set` method could return
    normally. In particular, fields which are both `static`
    and `final` may never be set.

    If the field is `static`, and
    if the returned method handle is invoked, the field's class will
    be initialized, if it has not already been initialized.

    Parameters:
    :   `f` - the reflected field

    Returns:
    :   a method handle which can store values into the reflected field

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalAccessException` - if access checking fails,
        or if the field is `final` and write access
        is not enabled on the `Field` object
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the argument is null
  + ### unreflectVarHandle

    public [VarHandle](VarHandle.md "class in java.lang.invoke") unreflectVarHandle([Field](../reflect/Field.md "class in java.lang.reflect") f)
    throws [IllegalAccessException](../IllegalAccessException.md "class in java.lang")

    Produces a VarHandle giving access to a reflected field `f`
    of type `T` declared in a class of type `R`.
    The VarHandle's variable type is `T`.
    If the field is non-static the VarHandle has one coordinate type,
    `R`. Otherwise, the field is static, and the VarHandle has no
    coordinate types.

    Access checking is performed immediately on behalf of the lookup
    class, regardless of the value of the field's `accessible`
    flag.

    If the field is static, and if the returned VarHandle is operated
    on, the field's declaring class will be initialized, if it has not
    already been initialized.

    Certain access modes of the returned VarHandle are unsupported under
    the following conditions:
    - if the field is declared `final`, then the write, atomic
      update, numeric atomic update, and bitwise atomic update access
      modes are unsupported.- if the field type is anything other than `byte`,
        `short`, `char`, `int`, `long`,
        `float`, or `double` then numeric atomic update
        access modes are unsupported.- if the field type is anything other than `boolean`,
          `byte`, `short`, `char`, `int` or
          `long` then bitwise atomic update access modes are
          unsupported.

    If the field is declared `volatile` then the returned VarHandle
    will override access to the field (effectively ignore the
    `volatile` declaration) in accordance to its specified
    access modes.

    If the field type is `float` or `double` then numeric
    and atomic update access modes compare values using their bitwise
    representation (see [`Float.floatToRawIntBits(float)`](../Float.md#floatToRawIntBits(float)) and
    [`Double.doubleToRawLongBits(double)`](../Double.md#doubleToRawLongBits(double)), respectively).

    Parameters:
    :   `f` - the reflected field, with a field of type `T`, and
        a declaring class of type `R`

    Returns:
    :   a VarHandle giving access to non-static fields or a static
        field

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalAccessException` - if access checking fails
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the argument is null

    public [MethodHandleInfo](MethodHandleInfo.md "interface in java.lang.invoke") revealDirect([MethodHandle](MethodHandle.md "class in java.lang.invoke") target)

    Cracks a [direct method handle](MethodHandleInfo.md#directmh)
    created by this lookup object or a similar one.
    Security and access checks are performed to ensure that this lookup object
    is capable of reproducing the target method handle.
    This means that the cracking may fail if target is a direct method handle
    but was created by an unrelated lookup object.
    This can happen if the method handle is [caller sensitive](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#callsens)
    and was created by a lookup object for a different class.

    Parameters:
    :   `target` - a direct method handle to crack into symbolic reference components

    Returns:
    :   a symbolic reference which can be used to reconstruct this method handle from this lookup object

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager is present and it
        [refuses access](MethodHandles.Lookup.md#secmgr)
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the target is not a direct method handle or if access checking fails
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the target is `null`

    [@Deprecated](../Deprecated.md "annotation interface in java.lang")([since](../Deprecated.md#since())="14")
    public boolean hasPrivateAccess()

    Deprecated.

    This method was originally designed to test `PRIVATE` access
    that implies full privilege access but `MODULE` access has since become
    independent of `PRIVATE` access. It is recommended to call
    [`hasFullPrivilegeAccess()`](#hasFullPrivilegeAccess()) instead.

    Returns `true` if this lookup has `PRIVATE` and `MODULE` access.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this lookup has `PRIVATE` and `MODULE` access.

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### hasFullPrivilegeAccess

    public boolean hasFullPrivilegeAccess()

    Returns `true` if this lookup has *full privilege access*,
    i.e. `PRIVATE` and `MODULE` access.
    A `Lookup` object must have full privilege access in order to
    access all members that are allowed to the
    [lookup class](#lookupClass()).

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this lookup has full privilege access.
