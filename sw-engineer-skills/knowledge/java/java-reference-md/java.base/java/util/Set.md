public interface Set<E>
extends [Collection](Collection.md "interface in java.util")<E>

A collection that contains no duplicate elements. More formally, sets
contain no pair of elements `e1` and `e2` such that
`e1.equals(e2)`, and at most one null element. As implied by
its name, this interface models the mathematical *set* abstraction.

The `Set` interface places additional stipulations, beyond those
inherited from the `Collection` interface, on the contracts of all
constructors and on the contracts of the `add`, `equals` and
`hashCode` methods. Declarations for other inherited methods are
also included here for convenience. (The specifications accompanying these
declarations have been tailored to the `Set` interface, but they do
not contain any additional stipulations.)

The additional stipulation on constructors is, not surprisingly,
that all constructors must create a set that contains no duplicate elements
(as defined above).

Note: Great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as set
elements. The behavior of a set is not specified if the value of an object
is changed in a manner that affects `equals` comparisons while the
object is an element in the set. A special case of this prohibition is
that it is not permissible for a set to contain itself as an element.

Some set implementations have restrictions on the elements that
they may contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
and some have restrictions on the types of their elements. Attempting to
add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
`NullPointerException` or `ClassCastException`. Attempting
to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
behavior and some will exhibit the latter. More generally, attempting an
operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
the insertion of an ineligible element into the set may throw an
exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
interface.

## Unmodifiable Sets

The [`Set.of`](#of(E...)) and
[`Set.copyOf`](#copyOf(java.util.Collection)) static factory methods
provide a convenient way to create unmodifiable sets. The `Set`
instances created by these methods have the following characteristics:

* They are [*unmodifiable*](Collection.md#unmodifiable). Elements cannot
  be added or removed. Calling any mutator method on the Set
  will always cause `UnsupportedOperationException` to be thrown.
  However, if the contained elements are themselves mutable, this may cause the
  Set to behave inconsistently or its contents to appear to change.* They disallow `null` elements. Attempts to create them with
    `null` elements result in `NullPointerException`.* They are serializable if all elements are serializable.* They reject duplicate elements at creation time. Duplicate elements
        passed to a static factory method result in `IllegalArgumentException`.* The iteration order of set elements is unspecified and is subject to change.* They are [value-based](../lang/doc-files/ValueBased.md).
            Programmers should treat instances that are [equal](#equals(java.lang.Object))
            as interchangeable and should not use them for synchronization, or
            unpredictable behavior may occur. For example, in a future release,
            synchronization may fail. Callers should make no assumptions
            about the identity of the returned instances. Factories are free to
            create new instances or reuse existing ones.* They are serialized as specified on the
              [Serialized Form](../../../serialized-form.md#java.util.CollSer)
              page.

This interface is a member of the
[Java Collections Framework](../../../java.base/java/util/package-summary.md#CollectionsFramework).

* ## Method Details

  + ### size

    int size()

    Returns the number of elements in this set (its cardinality). If this
    set contains more than `Integer.MAX_VALUE` elements, returns
    `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

    Specified by:
    :   `size` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Returns:
    :   the number of elements in this set (its cardinality)
  + ### isEmpty

    boolean isEmpty()

    Returns `true` if this set contains no elements.

    Specified by:
    :   `isEmpty` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this set contains no elements
  + ### contains

    boolean contains([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") o)

    Returns `true` if this set contains the specified element.
    More formally, returns `true` if and only if this set
    contains an element `e` such that
    `Objects.equals(o, e)`.

    Specified by:
    :   `contains` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Parameters:
    :   `o` - element whose presence in this set is to be tested

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this set contains the specified element

    Throws:
    :   `ClassCastException` - if the type of the specified element
        is incompatible with this set
        ([optional](Collection.md#optional-restrictions))
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified element is null and this
        set does not permit null elements
        ([optional](Collection.md#optional-restrictions))
  + ### iterator

    [Iterator](Iterator.md "interface in java.util")<[E](Set.md "type parameter in Set")> iterator()

    Returns an iterator over the elements in this set. The elements are
    returned in no particular order (unless this set is an instance of some
    class that provides a guarantee).

    Specified by:
    :   `iterator` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Specified by:
    :   `iterator` in interface `Iterable<E>`

    Returns:
    :   an iterator over the elements in this set
  + ### toArray

    [Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")[] toArray()

    Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set.
    If this set makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
    are returned by its iterator, this method must return the
    elements in the same order.

    The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it
    are maintained by this set. (In other words, this method must
    allocate a new array even if this set is backed by an array).
    The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

    This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
    APIs.

    Specified by:
    :   `toArray` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Returns:
    :   an array containing all the elements in this set
  + ### toArray

    <T> T[] toArray(T[] a)

    Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set; the
    runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.
    If the set fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
    Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the
    specified array and the size of this set.

    If this set fits in the specified array with room to spare
    (i.e., the array has more elements than this set), the element in
    the array immediately following the end of the set is set to
    `null`. (This is useful in determining the length of this
    set *only* if the caller knows that this set does not contain
    any null elements.)

    If this set makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
    are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements
    in the same order.

    Like the [`toArray()`](#toArray()) method, this method acts as bridge between
    array-based and collection-based APIs. Further, this method allows
    precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
    under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

    Suppose `x` is a set known to contain only strings.
    The following code can be used to dump the set into a newly allocated
    array of `String`:

    ```
         String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);
    ```

    Note that `toArray(new Object[0])` is identical in function to
    `toArray()`.

    Specified by:
    :   `toArray` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the component type of the array to contain the collection

    Parameters:
    :   `a` - the array into which the elements of this set are to be
        stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the same
        runtime type is allocated for this purpose.

    Returns:
    :   an array containing all the elements in this set

    Throws:
    :   `ArrayStoreException` - if the runtime type of the specified array
        is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in this
        set
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified array is null
  + ### add

    boolean add([E](Set.md "type parameter in Set") e)

    Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present
    (optional operation). More formally, adds the specified element
    `e` to this set if the set contains no element `e2`
    such that
    `Objects.equals(e, e2)`.
    If this set already contains the element, the call leaves the set
    unchanged and returns `false`. In combination with the
    restriction on constructors, this ensures that sets never contain
    duplicate elements.

    The stipulation above does not imply that sets must accept all
    elements; sets may refuse to add any particular element, including
    `null`, and throw an exception, as described in the
    specification for [`Collection.add`](Collection.md#add(E)).
    Individual set implementations should clearly document any
    restrictions on the elements that they may contain.

    Specified by:
    :   `add` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Parameters:
    :   `e` - element to be added to this set

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this set did not already contain the specified
        element

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the `add` operation
        is not supported by this set
    :   `ClassCastException` - if the class of the specified element
        prevents it from being added to this set
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified element is null and this
        set does not permit null elements
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if some property of the specified element
        prevents it from being added to this set
  + ### remove

    boolean remove([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") o)

    Removes the specified element from this set if it is present
    (optional operation). More formally, removes an element `e`
    such that
    `Objects.equals(o, e)`, if
    this set contains such an element. Returns `true` if this set
    contained the element (or equivalently, if this set changed as a
    result of the call). (This set will not contain the element once the
    call returns.)

    Specified by:
    :   `remove` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Parameters:
    :   `o` - object to be removed from this set, if present

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this set contained the specified element

    Throws:
    :   `ClassCastException` - if the type of the specified element
        is incompatible with this set
        ([optional](Collection.md#optional-restrictions))
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified element is null and this
        set does not permit null elements
        ([optional](Collection.md#optional-restrictions))
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the `remove` operation
        is not supported by this set
  + ### containsAll

    boolean containsAll([Collection](Collection.md "interface in java.util")<?> c)

    Returns `true` if this set contains all of the elements of the
    specified collection. If the specified collection is also a set, this
    method returns `true` if it is a *subset* of this set.

    Specified by:
    :   `containsAll` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - collection to be checked for containment in this set

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this set contains all of the elements of the
        specified collection

    Throws:
    :   `ClassCastException` - if the types of one or more elements
        in the specified collection are incompatible with this
        set
        ([optional](Collection.md#optional-restrictions))
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified collection contains one
        or more null elements and this set does not permit null
        elements
        ([optional](Collection.md#optional-restrictions)),
        or if the specified collection is null

    See Also:
    :   - [`contains(Object)`](#contains(java.lang.Object))
  + ### addAll

    boolean addAll([Collection](Collection.md "interface in java.util")<? extends [E](Set.md "type parameter in Set")> c)

    Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this set if
    they're not already present (optional operation). If the specified
    collection is also a set, the `addAll` operation effectively
    modifies this set so that its value is the *union* of the two
    sets. The behavior of this operation is undefined if the specified
    collection is modified while the operation is in progress.

    Specified by:
    :   `addAll` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - collection containing elements to be added to this set

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this set changed as a result of the call

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the `addAll` operation
        is not supported by this set
    :   `ClassCastException` - if the class of an element of the
        specified collection prevents it from being added to this set
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified collection contains one
        or more null elements and this set does not permit null
        elements, or if the specified collection is null
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if some property of an element of the
        specified collection prevents it from being added to this set

    See Also:
    :   - [`add(Object)`](#add(E))
  + ### retainAll

    boolean retainAll([Collection](Collection.md "interface in java.util")<?> c)

    Retains only the elements in this set that are contained in the
    specified collection (optional operation). In other words, removes
    from this set all of its elements that are not contained in the
    specified collection. If the specified collection is also a set, this
    operation effectively modifies this set so that its value is the
    *intersection* of the two sets.

    Specified by:
    :   `retainAll` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - collection containing elements to be retained in this set

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this set changed as a result of the call

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the `retainAll` operation
        is not supported by this set
    :   `ClassCastException` - if the class of an element of this set
        is incompatible with the specified collection
        ([optional](Collection.md#optional-restrictions))
    :   `NullPointerException` - if this set contains a null element and the
        specified collection does not permit null elements
        ([optional](Collection.md#optional-restrictions)),
        or if the specified collection is null

    See Also:
    :   - [`remove(Object)`](#remove(java.lang.Object))
  + ### removeAll

    boolean removeAll([Collection](Collection.md "interface in java.util")<?> c)

    Removes from this set all of its elements that are contained in the
    specified collection (optional operation). If the specified
    collection is also a set, this operation effectively modifies this
    set so that its value is the *asymmetric set difference* of
    the two sets.

    Specified by:
    :   `removeAll` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - collection containing elements to be removed from this set

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this set changed as a result of the call

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the `removeAll` operation
        is not supported by this set
    :   `ClassCastException` - if the class of an element of this set
        is incompatible with the specified collection
        ([optional](Collection.md#optional-restrictions))
    :   `NullPointerException` - if this set contains a null element and the
        specified collection does not permit null elements
        ([optional](Collection.md#optional-restrictions)),
        or if the specified collection is null

    See Also:
    :   - [`remove(Object)`](#remove(java.lang.Object))
        - [`contains(Object)`](#contains(java.lang.Object))
  + ### clear

    void clear()

    Removes all of the elements from this set (optional operation).
    The set will be empty after this call returns.

    Specified by:
    :   `clear` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the `clear` method
        is not supported by this set
  + ### equals

    boolean equals([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") o)

    Compares the specified object with this set for equality. Returns
    `true` if the specified object is also a set, the two sets
    have the same size, and every member of the specified set is
    contained in this set (or equivalently, every member of this set is
    contained in the specified set). This definition ensures that the
    equals method works properly across different implementations of the
    set interface.

    Specified by:
    :   `equals` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Overrides:
    :   `equals` in class `Object`

    Parameters:
    :   `o` - object to be compared for equality with this set

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the specified object is equal to this set

    See Also:
    :   - [`Object.hashCode()`](../lang/Object.md#hashCode())
        - [`HashMap`](HashMap.md "class in java.util")
  + ### hashCode

    int hashCode()

    Returns the hash code value for this set. The hash code of a set is
    defined to be the sum of the hash codes of the elements in the set,
    where the hash code of a `null` element is defined to be zero.
    This ensures that `s1.equals(s2)` implies that
    `s1.hashCode()==s2.hashCode()` for any two sets `s1`
    and `s2`, as required by the general contract of
    [`Object.hashCode()`](../lang/Object.md#hashCode()).

    Specified by:
    :   `hashCode` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Overrides:
    :   `hashCode` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   the hash code value for this set

    See Also:
    :   - [`Object.equals(Object)`](../lang/Object.md#equals(java.lang.Object))
        - [`equals(Object)`](#equals(java.lang.Object))
  + ### spliterator

    default [Spliterator](Spliterator.md "interface in java.util")<[E](Set.md "type parameter in Set")> spliterator()

    Creates a `Spliterator` over the elements in this set.

    The `Spliterator` reports [`Spliterator.DISTINCT`](Spliterator.md#DISTINCT).
    Implementations should document the reporting of additional
    characteristic values.

    Specified by:
    :   `spliterator` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Specified by:
    :   `spliterator` in interface `Iterable<E>`

    Returns:
    :   a `Spliterator` over the elements in this set

    Since:
    :   1.8
  + ### of

    static <E> [Set](Set.md "interface in java.util")<E> of()

    Returns an unmodifiable set containing zero elements.
    See [Unmodifiable Sets](#unmodifiable) for details.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `E` - the `Set`'s element type

    Returns:
    :   an empty `Set`

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### of

    static <E> [Set](Set.md "interface in java.util")<E> of(E e1)

    Returns an unmodifiable set containing one element.
    See [Unmodifiable Sets](#unmodifiable) for details.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `E` - the `Set`'s element type
