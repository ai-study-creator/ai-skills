public class GregorianCalendar
extends [Calendar](Calendar.md "class in java.util")

`GregorianCalendar` is a concrete subclass of
`Calendar` and provides the standard calendar system
used by most of the world.

`GregorianCalendar` is a hybrid calendar that
supports both the Julian and Gregorian calendar systems with the
support of a single discontinuity, which corresponds by default to
the Gregorian date when the Gregorian calendar was instituted
(October 15, 1582 in some countries, later in others). The cutover
date may be changed by the caller by calling [`setGregorianChange()`](#setGregorianChange(java.util.Date)).

Historically, in those countries which adopted the Gregorian calendar first,
October 4, 1582 (Julian) was thus followed by October 15, 1582 (Gregorian). This calendar models
this correctly. Before the Gregorian cutover, `GregorianCalendar`
implements the Julian calendar. The only difference between the Gregorian
and the Julian calendar is the leap year rule. The Julian calendar specifies
leap years every four years, whereas the Gregorian calendar omits century
years which are not divisible by 400.

`GregorianCalendar` implements *proleptic* Gregorian and
Julian calendars. That is, dates are computed by extrapolating the current
rules indefinitely far backward and forward in time. As a result,
`GregorianCalendar` may be used for all years to generate
meaningful and consistent results. However, dates obtained using
`GregorianCalendar` are historically accurate only from March 1, 4
AD onward, when modern Julian calendar rules were adopted. Before this date,
leap year rules were applied irregularly, and before 45 BC the Julian
calendar did not even exist.

Prior to the institution of the Gregorian calendar, New Year's Day was
March 25. To avoid confusion, this calendar always uses January 1. A manual
adjustment may be made if desired for dates that are prior to the Gregorian
changeover and which fall between January 1 and March 24.

## Week Of Year and Week Year

Values calculated for the [`WEEK_OF_YEAR`](Calendar.md#WEEK_OF_YEAR) field range from 1 to 53. The first week of a
calendar year is the earliest seven day period starting on [`getFirstDayOfWeek()`](Calendar.md#getFirstDayOfWeek()) that contains at
least [`getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()`](Calendar.md#getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()) days from that year. It thus depends
on the values of `getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()`, `getFirstDayOfWeek()`, and the day of the week of January 1. Weeks
between week 1 of one year and week 1 of the following year
(exclusive) are numbered sequentially from 2 to 52 or 53 (except
for year(s) involved in the Julian-Gregorian transition).

The `getFirstDayOfWeek()` and `getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()` values are initialized using
locale-dependent resources when constructing a `GregorianCalendar`. The week
determination is compatible with the ISO 8601 standard when `getFirstDayOfWeek()` is `MONDAY` and `getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()` is 4, which values are used in locales
where the standard is preferred. These values can explicitly be set by
calling [`setFirstDayOfWeek()`](Calendar.md#setFirstDayOfWeek(int)) and
[`setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()`](Calendar.md#setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(int)).

A *week year* is in sync with a
`WEEK_OF_YEAR` cycle. All weeks between the first and last
weeks (inclusive) have the same *week year* value.
Therefore, the first and last days of a week year may have
different calendar year values.

For example, January 1, 1998 is a Thursday. If `getFirstDayOfWeek()` is `MONDAY` and `getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()` is 4 (ISO 8601 standard compatible
setting), then week 1 of 1998 starts on December 29, 1997, and ends
on January 4, 1998. The week year is 1998 for the last three days
of calendar year 1997. If, however, `getFirstDayOfWeek()` is
`SUNDAY`, then week 1 of 1998 starts on January 4, 1998, and
ends on January 10, 1998; the first three days of 1998 then are
part of week 53 of 1997 and their week year is 1997.

### Week Of Month

Values calculated for the `WEEK_OF_MONTH` field range from 0
to 6. Week 1 of a month (the days with `WEEK_OF_MONTH =
1`) is the earliest set of at least
`getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()` contiguous days in that month,
ending on the day before `getFirstDayOfWeek()`. Unlike
week 1 of a year, week 1 of a month may be shorter than 7 days, need
not start on `getFirstDayOfWeek()`, and will not include days of
the previous month. Days of a month before week 1 have a
`WEEK_OF_MONTH` of 0.

For example, if `getFirstDayOfWeek()` is `SUNDAY`
and `getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()` is 4, then the first week of
January 1998 is Sunday, January 4 through Saturday, January 10. These days
have a `WEEK_OF_MONTH` of 1. Thursday, January 1 through
Saturday, January 3 have a `WEEK_OF_MONTH` of 0. If
`getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()` is changed to 3, then January 1
through January 3 have a `WEEK_OF_MONTH` of 1.

### Default Fields Values

The `clear` method sets calendar field(s)
undefined. `GregorianCalendar` uses the following
default value for each calendar field if its value is undefined.

GregorianCalendar default field values

| Field | Default Value |
| --- | --- |
| `ERA` | `AD` |
| `YEAR` | `1970` |
| `MONTH` | `JANUARY` |
| `DAY_OF_MONTH` | `1` |
| `DAY_OF_WEEK` | `the first day of week` |
| `WEEK_OF_MONTH` | `0` |
| `DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH` | `1` |
| `AM_PM` | `AM` |
| `HOUR, HOUR_OF_DAY, MINUTE, SECOND, MILLISECOND` | `0` |

  
Default values are not applicable for the fields not listed above.

  + ### add

    public void add(int field,
    int amount)

    Adds the specified (signed) amount of time to the given calendar field,
    based on the calendar's rules.

    *Add rule 1*. The value of `field`
    after the call minus the value of `field` before the
    call is `amount`, modulo any overflow that has occurred in
    `field`. Overflow occurs when a field value exceeds its
    range and, as a result, the next larger field is incremented or
    decremented and the field value is adjusted back into its range.

    *Add rule 2*. If a smaller field is expected to be
    invariant, but it is impossible for it to be equal to its
    prior value because of changes in its minimum or maximum after
    `field` is changed, then its value is adjusted to be as close
    as possible to its expected value. A smaller field represents a
    smaller unit of time. `HOUR` is a smaller field than
    `DAY_OF_MONTH`. No adjustment is made to smaller fields
    that are not expected to be invariant. The calendar system
    determines what fields are expected to be invariant.

    Specified by:
    :   `add` in class `Calendar`

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the calendar field.
    :   `amount` - the amount of date or time to be added to the field.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `field` is
        `ZONE_OFFSET`, `DST_OFFSET`, or unknown,
        or if any calendar fields have out-of-range values in
        non-lenient mode.

        - [`Calendar.set(int,int)`](Calendar.md#set(int,int))
  + ### roll

    public void roll(int field,
    boolean up)

    Adds or subtracts (up/down) a single unit of time on the given time
    field without changing larger fields.

    *Example*: Consider a `GregorianCalendar`
    originally set to December 31, 1999. Calling [`roll(Calendar.MONTH, true)`](#roll(int,boolean))
    sets the calendar to January 31, 1999. The `YEAR` field is unchanged
    because it is a larger field than `MONTH`.

    Specified by:
    :   `roll` in class `Calendar`

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the time field.
    :   `up` - indicates if the value of the specified calendar field is to be
        rolled up or rolled down. Use `true` if rolling up, `false` otherwise.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `field` is
        `ZONE_OFFSET`, `DST_OFFSET`, or unknown,
        or if any calendar fields have out-of-range values in
        non-lenient mode.

        - [`Calendar.set(int,int)`](Calendar.md#set(int,int))
  + ### roll

    public void roll(int field,
    int amount)

    Adds a signed amount to the specified calendar field without changing larger fields.
    A negative roll amount means to subtract from field without changing
    larger fields. If the specified amount is 0, this method performs nothing.

    This method calls [`Calendar.complete()`](Calendar.md#complete()) before adding the
    amount so that all the calendar fields are normalized. If there
    is any calendar field having an out-of-range value in non-lenient mode, then an
    `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.

    *Example*: Consider a `GregorianCalendar`
    originally set to August 31, 1999. Calling `roll(Calendar.MONTH,
    8)` sets the calendar to April 30, **1999**. Using a
    `GregorianCalendar`, the `DAY_OF_MONTH` field cannot
    be 31 in the month April. `DAY_OF_MONTH` is set to the closest possible
    value, 30. The `YEAR` field maintains the value of 1999 because it
    is a larger field than `MONTH`.

    *Example*: Consider a `GregorianCalendar`
    originally set to Sunday June 6, 1999. Calling
    `roll(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1)` sets the calendar to
    Tuesday June 1, 1999, whereas calling
    `add(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1)` sets the calendar to
    Sunday May 30, 1999. This is because the roll rule imposes an
    additional constraint: The `MONTH` must not change when the
    `WEEK_OF_MONTH` is rolled. Taken together with add rule 1,
    the resultant date must be between Tuesday June 1 and Saturday June
    5. According to add rule 2, the `DAY_OF_WEEK`, an invariant
    when changing the `WEEK_OF_MONTH`, is set to Tuesday, the
    closest possible value to Sunday (where Sunday is the first day of the
    week).

    Overrides:
    :   `roll` in class `Calendar`

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the calendar field.
    :   `amount` - the signed amount to add to `field`.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `field` is
        `ZONE_OFFSET`, `DST_OFFSET`, or unknown,
        or if any calendar fields have out-of-range values in
        non-lenient mode.

  + ### getGreatestMinimum

    public int getGreatestMinimum(int field)

    Returns the highest minimum value for the given calendar field
    of this `GregorianCalendar` instance. The highest
    minimum value is defined as the largest value returned by
    [`getActualMinimum(int)`](#getActualMinimum(int)) for any possible time value,
    taking into consideration the current values of the
    [`getFirstDayOfWeek`](Calendar.md#getFirstDayOfWeek()),

  + ### getLeastMaximum

    public int getLeastMaximum(int field)

    Returns the lowest maximum value for the given calendar field
    of this `GregorianCalendar` instance. The lowest
    maximum value is defined as the smallest value returned by
    [`getActualMaximum(int)`](#getActualMaximum(int)) for any possible time value,
    taking into consideration the current values of the
    [`getFirstDayOfWeek`](Calendar.md#getFirstDayOfWeek()),
    [`getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek`](Calendar.md#getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()),
    [`getGregorianChange`](#getGregorianChange()) and
    [`getTimeZone`](Calendar.md#getTimeZone()) methods.

    Specified by:
    :   `getLeastMaximum` in class `Calendar`

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the calendar field

    Returns:
    :   the lowest maximum value for the given calendar field.

        - [`getActualMaximum(int)`](#getActualMaximum(int))
  + ### getActualMinimum

    public int getActualMinimum(int field)

    Returns the minimum value that this calendar field could have,
    taking into consideration the given time value and the current
    values of the
    [`getFirstDayOfWeek`](Calendar.md#getFirstDayOfWeek()),
    [`getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek`](Calendar.md#getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()),
    [`getGregorianChange`](#getGregorianChange()) and
    [`getTimeZone`](Calendar.md#getTimeZone()) methods.

    For example, if the Gregorian change date is January 10,
    1970 and the date of this `GregorianCalendar` is
    January 20, 1970, the actual minimum value of the
    `DAY_OF_MONTH` field is 10 because the previous date
    of January 10, 1970 is December 27, 1996 (in the Julian
    calendar). Therefore, December 28, 1969 to January 9, 1970
    don't exist.

    Overrides:
    :   `getActualMinimum` in class `Calendar`

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the calendar field

    Returns:
    :   the minimum of the given field for the time value of
        this `GregorianCalendar`

  + ### getActualMaximum

    public int getActualMaximum(int field)

    Returns the maximum value that this calendar field could have,
    taking into consideration the given time value and the current
    values of the
    [`getFirstDayOfWeek`](Calendar.md#getFirstDayOfWeek()),
    [`getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek`](Calendar.md#getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()),
    [`getGregorianChange`](#getGregorianChange()) and
    [`getTimeZone`](Calendar.md#getTimeZone()) methods.
    For example, if the date of this instance is February 1, 2004,
    the actual maximum value of the `DAY_OF_MONTH` field
    is 29 because 2004 is a leap year, and if the date of this
    instance is February 1, 2005, it's 28.

    This method calculates the maximum value of [`WEEK_OF_YEAR`](Calendar.md#WEEK_OF_YEAR) based on the [`YEAR`](Calendar.md#YEAR) (calendar year) value, not the [week year](#week_year). Call [`getWeeksInWeekYear()`](#getWeeksInWeekYear()) to get the maximum value of `WEEK_OF_YEAR` in the week year of this `GregorianCalendar`.

    Overrides:
    :   `getActualMaximum` in class `Calendar`

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the calendar field

    Returns:

    Parameters:
    :   `zone` - the given time zone.
  + ### isWeekDateSupported

    public final boolean isWeekDateSupported()

    Returns `true` indicating this `GregorianCalendar`
    supports week dates.

  + ### getWeekYear

    public int getWeekYear()

    Returns the [week year](#week_year) represented by this
    `GregorianCalendar`. The dates in the weeks between 1 and the
    maximum week number of the week year have the same week year value
    that may be one year before or after the [`YEAR`](Calendar.md#YEAR)
    (calendar year) value.

    This method calls [`Calendar.complete()`](Calendar.md#complete()) before
    calculating the week year.

    Overrides:
    :   `getWeekYear` in class `Calendar`

    Returns:
    :   the week year represented by this `GregorianCalendar`.
        If the [`ERA`](Calendar.md#ERA) value is [`BC`](#BC), the year is
        represented by 0 or a negative number: BC 1 is 0, BC 2
        is -1, BC 3 is -2, and so on.

  + ### setWeekDate

    public void setWeekDate(int weekYear,
    int weekOfYear,
    int dayOfWeek)

    Sets this `GregorianCalendar` to the date given by the
    date specifiers - [`weekYear`](#week_year),
    `weekOfYear`, and `dayOfWeek`. `weekOfYear`
    follows the [`WEEK_OF_YEAR`
    numbering](#week_and_year). The `dayOfWeek` value must be one of the
    [`DAY_OF_WEEK`](Calendar.md#DAY_OF_WEEK) values: [`SUNDAY`](Calendar.md#SUNDAY) to [`SATURDAY`](Calendar.md#SATURDAY).

    Note that the numeric day-of-week representation differs from
    the ISO 8601 standard, and that the `weekOfYear`
    numbering is compatible with the standard when `getFirstDayOfWeek()` is `MONDAY` and `getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()` is 4.

    Unlike the `set` method, all of the calendar fields
    and the instant of time value are calculated upon return.

    If `weekOfYear` is out of the valid week-of-year
    range in `weekYear`, the `weekYear`
    and `weekOfYear` values are adjusted in lenient
    mode, or an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown in
    non-lenient mode.

    Overrides:
    :   `setWeekDate` in class `Calendar`

    Parameters:
    :   `weekYear` - the week year
    :   `weekOfYear` - the week number based on `weekYear`
    :   `dayOfWeek` - the day of week value: one of the constants
        for the [`DAY_OF_WEEK`](Calendar.md#DAY_OF_WEEK) field:
        [`SUNDAY`](Calendar.md#SUNDAY), ...,
        [`SATURDAY`](Calendar.md#SATURDAY).

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if any of the given date specifiers is invalid,

  + ### getWeeksInWeekYear

    public int getWeeksInWeekYear()

    Returns the number of weeks in the [week year](#week_year)
    represented by this `GregorianCalendar`.

    For example, if this `GregorianCalendar`'s date is
    December 31, 2008 with [the ISO
    8601 compatible setting](#iso8601_compatible_setting), this method will return 53 for the
    period: December 29, 2008 to January 3, 2010 while [`getActualMaximum(WEEK_OF_YEAR)`](#getActualMaximum(int)) will return
    52 for the period: December 31, 2007 to December 28, 2008.

  + ### computeFields

    protected void computeFields()

    Converts the time value (millisecond offset from the [Epoch](Calendar.md#Epoch)) to calendar field values.
    The time is *not*

  + ### toZonedDateTime

    public [ZonedDateTime](../time/ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") toZonedDateTime()

    Converts this object to a `ZonedDateTime` that represents
    the same point on the time-line as this `GregorianCalendar`.

    Since this object supports a Julian-Gregorian cutover date and
    `ZonedDateTime` does not, it is possible that the resulting year,
    month and day will have different values. The result will represent the
    correct date in the ISO calendar system, which will also be the same value
    for Modified Julian Days.

    Returns:
    :   a zoned date-time representing the same point on the time-line
        as this gregorian calendar

    :   1.8
  + ### from

    public static [GregorianCalendar](GregorianCalendar.md "class in java.util") from([ZonedDateTime](../time/ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") zdt)

    Obtains an instance of `GregorianCalendar` with the default locale
    from a `ZonedDateTime` object.

    Since `ZonedDateTime` does not support a Julian-Gregorian cutover
    date and uses ISO calendar system, the return GregorianCalendar is a pure
    Gregorian calendar and uses ISO 8601 standard for week definitions,
    which has `MONDAY` as the [`FirstDayOfWeek`](Calendar.md#getFirstDayOfWeek()) and `4` as the value of the
    [`MinimalDaysInFirstWeek`](Calendar.md#getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()).

    `ZoneDateTime` can store points on the time-line further in the
    future and further in the past than `GregorianCalendar`. In this
    scenario, this method will throw an `IllegalArgumentException`
    exception.

    Parameters:
    :   `zdt` - the zoned date-time object to convert

    Returns:
    :   the gregorian calendar representing the same point on the
        time-line as the zoned date-time provided

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `zdt` is null
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the zoned date-time is too
        large to represent as a `GregorianCalendar`
