# Class Calendar

[java.lang.Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

java.util.Calendar

All Implemented Interfaces:
:   `Serializable`, `Cloneable`, `Comparable<Calendar>`

Direct Known Subclasses:

public abstract class Calendar
extends [Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Serializable](../io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io"), [Cloneable](../lang/Cloneable.md "interface in java.lang"), [Comparable](../lang/Comparable.md "interface in java.lang")<[Calendar](Calendar.md "class in java.util")>

The `Calendar` class is an abstract class that provides methods
for converting between a specific instant in time and a set of [`calendar fields`](#fields) such as `YEAR`, `MONTH`,
`DAY_OF_MONTH`, `HOUR`, and so on, and for
manipulating the calendar fields, such as getting the date of the next
week. An instant in time can be represented by a millisecond value that is
an offset from the *Epoch*, January 1, 1970
00:00:00.000 GMT (Gregorian).

The class also provides additional fields and methods for
implementing a concrete calendar system outside the package. Those
fields and methods are defined as `protected`.

Like other locale-sensitive classes, `Calendar` provides a
class method, `getInstance`, for getting a generally useful
object of this type. `Calendar`'s `getInstance` method
returns a `Calendar` object whose
calendar fields have been initialized with the current date and time:
> ```
>      Calendar rightNow = Calendar.getInstance();
> ```

A `Calendar` object can produce all the calendar field values
needed to implement the date-time formatting for a particular language and
calendar style (for example, Japanese-Gregorian, Japanese-Traditional).
`Calendar` defines the range of values returned by
certain calendar fields, as well as their meaning. For example,
the first month of the calendar system has value `MONTH ==
JANUARY` for all calendars. Other values are defined by the
concrete subclass, such as `ERA`. See individual field
documentation and subclass documentation for details.

## Getting and Setting Calendar Field Values

The calendar field values can be set by calling the `set`
methods. Any field values set in a `Calendar` will not be
interpreted until it needs to calculate its time value (milliseconds from
the Epoch) or values of the calendar fields. Calling the
`get`, `getTimeInMillis`, `getTime`,
`add` and `roll` involves such calculation.
Unless otherwise specified, any `Calendar` method containing the
parameter `int field` will throw an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`
if the specified field is out of range (`field` < 0 ||
`field` >= [`FIELD_COUNT`](#FIELD_COUNT)).

### Leniency

`Calendar` has two modes for interpreting the calendar
fields, *lenient* and *non-lenient*. When a
`Calendar` is in lenient mode, it accepts a wider range of
calendar field values than it produces. When a `Calendar`
recomputes calendar field values for return by `get()`, all of
the calendar fields are normalized. For example, a lenient
`GregorianCalendar` interprets `MONTH == JANUARY`,
`DAY_OF_MONTH == 32` as February 1.

When a `Calendar` is in non-lenient mode, it throws an
exception if there is any inconsistency in its calendar fields. For
example, a `GregorianCalendar` always produces
`DAY_OF_MONTH` values between 1 and the length of the month. A
non-lenient `GregorianCalendar` throws an exception upon
calculating its time or calendar field values if any out-of-range field
value has been set.

### First Week

`Calendar` defines a locale-specific seven day week using two
parameters: the first day of the week and the minimal days in first week
(from 1 to 7). These numbers are taken from the locale resource data or the
locale itself when a `Calendar` is constructed. If the designated
locale contains "fw" and/or "rg" [Unicode extensions](./Locale.md#def_locale_extension), the first day of the week will be obtained according to
those extensions. If both "fw" and "rg" are specified, the value from the "fw"
extension supersedes the implicit one from the "rg" extension.
They may also be specified explicitly through the methods for setting their
values.

When setting or getting the `WEEK_OF_MONTH` or
`WEEK_OF_YEAR` fields, `Calendar` must determine the
first week of the month or year as a reference point. The first week of a
month or year is defined as the earliest seven day period beginning on
`getFirstDayOfWeek()` and containing at least
`getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()` days of that month or year. Weeks
numbered ..., -1, 0 precede the first week; weeks numbered 2, 3,... follow
it. Note that the normalized numbering returned by `get()` may be
different. For example, a specific `Calendar` subclass may
designate the week before week 1 of a year as week `n` of
the previous year.

### Calendar Fields Resolution

When computing a date and time from the calendar fields, there
may be insufficient information for the computation (such as only
year and month with no day of month), or there may be inconsistent
information (such as Tuesday, July 15, 1996 (Gregorian) -- July 15,
1996 is actually a Monday). `Calendar` will resolve
calendar field values to determine the date and time in the
following way.

If there is any conflict in calendar field values,
`Calendar` gives priorities to calendar fields that have been set
more recently. The following are the default combinations of the
calendar fields. The most recent combination, as determined by the
most recently set single field, will be used.

For the date fields:
> ```
>  YEAR + MONTH + DAY_OF_MONTH
>  YEAR + MONTH + WEEK_OF_MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK
>  YEAR + MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK
>  YEAR + DAY_OF_YEAR
>  YEAR + DAY_OF_WEEK + WEEK_OF_YEAR
> ```

For the time of day fields:
> ```
>  HOUR_OF_DAY
>  AM_PM + HOUR
> ```

If there are any calendar fields whose values haven't been set in the selected
field combination, `Calendar` uses their default values. The default
value of each field may vary by concrete calendar systems. For example, in
`GregorianCalendar`, the default of a field is the same as that
of the start of the Epoch: i.e., `YEAR = 1970`, `MONTH =
JANUARY`, `DAY_OF_MONTH = 1`, etc.

**Note:** There are certain possible ambiguities in
interpretation of certain singular times, which are resolved in the
following ways:

1. 23:59 is the last minute of the day and 00:00 is the first
   minute of the next day. Thus, 23:59 on Dec 31, 1999 < 00:00 on
   Jan 1, 2000 < 00:01 on Jan 1, 2000.- Although historically not precise, midnight also belongs to "am",
     and noon belongs to "pm", so on the same day,
     12:00 am (midnight) < 12:01 am, and 12:00 pm (noon) < 12:01 pm

The date or time format strings are not part of the definition of a
calendar, as those must be modifiable or overridable by the user at
runtime. Use [`DateFormat`](../text/DateFormat.md "class in java.text")
to format dates.

### Field Manipulation

The calendar fields can be changed using three methods:
`set()`, `add()`, and `roll()`.

**`set(f, value)`** changes calendar field
`f` to `value`. In addition, it sets an
internal member variable to indicate that calendar field `f` has
been changed. Although calendar field `f` is changed immediately,
the calendar's time value in milliseconds is not recomputed until the next call to
`get()`, `getTime()`, `getTimeInMillis()`,
`add()`, or `roll()` is made. Thus, multiple calls to
`set()` do not trigger multiple, unnecessary
computations. As a result of changing a calendar field using
`set()`, other calendar fields may also change, depending on the
calendar field, the calendar field value, and the calendar system. In addition,
`get(f)` will not necessarily return `value` set by
the call to the `set` method
after the calendar fields have been recomputed. The specifics are determined by
the concrete calendar class.

*Example*: Consider a `GregorianCalendar`
originally set to August 31, 1999. Calling `set(Calendar.MONTH,
Calendar.SEPTEMBER)` sets the date to September 31,
1999. This is a temporary internal representation that resolves to
October 1, 1999 if `getTime()` is then called. However, a
call to `set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 30)` before the call to
`getTime()` sets the date to September 30, 1999, since
no recomputation occurs after `set()` itself.

**`add(f, delta)`** adds `delta`
to field `f`. This is equivalent to calling `set(f,
get(f) + delta)` with two adjustments:

> **Add rule 1**. The value of field `f`
> after the call minus the value of field `f` before the
> call is `delta`, modulo any overflow that has occurred in
> field `f`. Overflow occurs when a field value exceeds its
> range and, as a result, the next larger field is incremented or
> decremented and the field value is adjusted back into its range.
>
> **Add rule 2**. If a smaller field is expected to be
> invariant, but it is impossible for it to be equal to its
> prior value because of changes in its minimum or maximum after field
> `f` is changed or other constraints, such as time zone
> offset changes, then its value is adjusted to be as close
> as possible to its expected value. A smaller field represents a
> smaller unit of time. `HOUR` is a smaller field than
> `DAY_OF_MONTH`. No adjustment is made to smaller fields
> that are not expected to be invariant. The calendar system
> determines what fields are expected to be invariant.

In addition, unlike `set()`, `add()` forces
an immediate recomputation of the calendar's milliseconds and all
fields.

*Example*: Consider a `GregorianCalendar`
originally set to August 31, 1999. Calling `add(Calendar.MONTH,
13)` sets the calendar to September 30, 2000. **Add rule
1** sets the `MONTH` field to September, since
adding 13 months to August gives September of the next year. Since
`DAY_OF_MONTH` cannot be 31 in September in a
`GregorianCalendar`, **add rule 2** sets the
`DAY_OF_MONTH` to 30, the closest possible value. Although
it is a smaller field, `DAY_OF_WEEK` is not adjusted by
rule 2, since it is expected to change when the month changes in a
`GregorianCalendar`.

**`roll(f, delta)`** adds
`delta` to field `f` without changing larger
fields. This is equivalent to calling `add(f, delta)` with
the following adjustment:

> **Roll rule**. Larger fields are unchanged after the
> call. A larger field represents a larger unit of
> time. `DAY_OF_MONTH` is a larger field than
> `HOUR`.

*Example*: See [`GregorianCalendar.roll(int, int)`](GregorianCalendar.md#roll(int,int)).

**Usage model**. To motivate the behavior of
`add()` and `roll()`, consider a user interface
component with increment and decrement buttons for the month, day, and
year, and an underlying `GregorianCalendar`. If the
interface reads January 31, 1999 and the user presses the month
increment button, what should it read? If the underlying
implementation uses `set()`, it might read March 3, 1999. A
better result would be February 28, 1999. Furthermore, if the user
presses the month increment button again, it should read March 31,
1999, not March 28, 1999. By saving the original date and using either
`add()` or `roll()`, depending on whether larger
fields should be affected, the user interface can behave as most users
will intuitively expect.

  + ### DATE

    public static final int DATE

    Field number for `get` and `set` indicating the
    day of the month. This is a synonym for `DAY_OF_MONTH`.
    The first day of the month has value 1.

    public static final int DAY\_OF\_YEAR

    Field number for `get` and `set` indicating the day
    number within the current year. The first day of the year has value 1.

    See Also:
    :   - [Constant Field Values](../../../constant-values.md#java.util.Calendar.DAY_OF_YEAR)
  + ### DAY\_OF\_WEEK

    public static final int DAY\_OF\_WEEK

    Field number for `get` and `set` indicating the day
    of the week. If the calendar is non-lenient, this field takes values
    `SUNDAY`, `MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`,
    `THURSDAY`, `FRIDAY`, and `SATURDAY`. Otherwise, any
    int values are accepted and normalized to one of the previously
    mentioned values.

    See Also:
    :   - [`SUNDAY`](#SUNDAY)
        - [`MONDAY`](#MONDAY)
        - [`TUESDAY`](#TUESDAY)

  + ### DAY\_OF\_WEEK\_IN\_MONTH

    public static final int DAY\_OF\_WEEK\_IN\_MONTH

    Field number for `get` and `set` indicating the
    ordinal number of the day of the week within the current month. Together
    with the `DAY_OF_WEEK` field, this uniquely specifies a day
    within a month. Unlike `WEEK_OF_MONTH` and
    `WEEK_OF_YEAR`, this field's value does *not* depend on
    `getFirstDayOfWeek()` or
    `getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()`. `DAY_OF_MONTH 1`
    through `7` always correspond to `DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH
    1`; `8` through `14` correspond to
    `DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH 2`, and so on.
    `DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH 0` indicates the week before
    `DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH 1`. Negative values count back from the
    end of the month, so the last Sunday of a month is specified as
    `DAY_OF_WEEK = SUNDAY, DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH = -1`. Because
    negative values count backward they will usually be aligned differently
    within the month than positive values. For example, if a month has 31
    days, `DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH -1` will overlap
    `DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH 5` and the end of `4`.

  + ### HOUR

    public static final int HOUR

    Field number for `get` and `set` indicating the
    hour of the morning or afternoon. `HOUR` is used for the
    12-hour clock (0 - 11). Noon and midnight are represented by 0, not by 12.

        `Calendar` instances are available.
  + ### computeTime

    protected abstract void computeTime()

    Converts the current calendar field values in [`fields[]`](#fields)
    to the millisecond time value
    [`time`](#time).

    See Also:
    :   - [`complete()`](#complete())
        - [`computeFields()`](#computeFields())
  + ### computeFields

    protected abstract void computeFields()

    Converts the current millisecond time value [`time`](#time)
    to calendar field values in [`fields[]`](#fields).
    This allows you to sync up the calendar field values with
    a new time that is set for the calendar. The time is *not*
    recomputed first; to recompute the time, then the fields, call the
    [`complete()`](#complete()) method.

    See Also:
    :   - [`computeTime()`](#computeTime())
  + ### getTime

    public final [Date](Date.md "class in java.util") getTime()

    Returns a `Date` object representing this
    `Calendar`'s time value (millisecond offset from the [Epoch](#Epoch)").

    Returns:
    :   a `Date` representing the time value.

    See Also:
    :   - [`setTime(Date)`](#setTime(java.util.Date))
        - [`getTimeInMillis()`](#getTimeInMillis())
  + ### setTime

    public final void setTime([Date](Date.md "class in java.util") date)

    Sets this Calendar's time with the given `Date`.

    Note: Calling `setTime()` with
    `Date(Long.MAX_VALUE)` or `Date(Long.MIN_VALUE)`
    may yield incorrect field values from `get()`.

    Parameters:
    :   `date` - the given Date.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `date` is `null`

    See Also:
    :   - [`getTime()`](#getTime())
        - [`setTimeInMillis(long)`](#setTimeInMillis(long))
  + ### getTimeInMillis

    public long getTimeInMillis()

    Returns this Calendar's time value in milliseconds.

    Returns:
    :   the current time as UTC milliseconds from the epoch.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getTime()`](#getTime())
        - [`setTimeInMillis(long)`](#setTimeInMillis(long))
  + ### setTimeInMillis

    public void setTimeInMillis(long millis)

    Sets this Calendar's current time from the given long value.

    Parameters:

        - [`getTimeInMillis()`](#getTimeInMillis())
  + ### get

    public int get(int field)

    Returns the value of the given calendar field. In lenient mode,
    all calendar fields are normalized. In non-lenient mode, all
    calendar fields are validated and this method throws an
    exception if any calendar fields have out-of-range values. The
    normalization and validation are handled by the
    [`complete()`](#complete()) method, which process is calendar
    system dependent.

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the given calendar field.

    Returns:
    :   the value for the given calendar field.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if this `Calendar` is non-lenient and any
        of the calendar fields have invalid values.

        - [`complete()`](#complete())
  + ### internalGet

    protected final int internalGet(int field)

    Returns the value of the given calendar field. This method does
    not involve normalization or validation of the field value.

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the given calendar field.

    Returns:
    :   the value for the given calendar field.

    See Also:
    :   - [`get(int)`](#get(int))
  + ### set

    public void set(int field,
    int value)

    Sets the given calendar field to the given value. The value is not
    interpreted by this method regardless of the leniency mode.

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the given calendar field.
    :   `value` - the value to be set for the given calendar field.

    public final void set(int year,
    int month,
    int date)

    Sets the values for the calendar fields `YEAR`,
    `MONTH`, and `DAY_OF_MONTH`.
    Previous values of other calendar fields are retained. If this is not desired,
    call [`clear()`](#clear()) first.

    Parameters:
    :   `year` - the value used to set the `YEAR` calendar field.

    int month,
    int date,
    int hourOfDay,
    int minute)

    Sets the values for the calendar fields `YEAR`,
    `MONTH`, `DAY_OF_MONTH`,
    `HOUR_OF_DAY`, and `MINUTE`.
    Previous values of other fields are retained. If this is not desired,
    call [`clear()`](#clear()) first.

    Parameters:
    :   `year` - the value used to set the `YEAR` calendar field.
    :   `month` - the value used to set the `MONTH` calendar field.

    public final void set(int year,
    int month,
    int date,
    int hourOfDay,
    int minute,
    int second)

    Sets the values for the fields `YEAR`, `MONTH`,
    `DAY_OF_MONTH`, `HOUR_OF_DAY`, `MINUTE`, and
    `SECOND`.
    Previous values of other fields are retained. If this is not desired,
    call [`clear()`](#clear()) first.

    Parameters:
    :   `year` - the value used to set the `YEAR` calendar field.
    :   `month` - the value used to set the `MONTH` calendar field.
        Month value is 0-based. e.g., 0 for January.
    :   `date` - the value used to set the `DAY_OF_MONTH` calendar field.

        - [`set(int,int,int,int,int)`](#set(int,int,int,int,int))
  + ### clear

    public final void clear()

    Sets all the calendar field values and the time value
    (millisecond offset from the [Epoch](#Epoch)) of
    this `Calendar` undefined. This means that [`isSet()`](#isSet(int)) will return `false` for all the
    calendar fields, and the date and time calculations will treat
    the fields as if they had never been set. A
    `Calendar` implementation class may use its specific
    default field values for date/time calculations. For example,
    `GregorianCalendar` uses 1970 if the
    `YEAR` field value is undefined.

    See Also:
    :   - [`clear(int)`](#clear(int))
  + ### clear

    public final void clear(int field)

    Sets the given calendar field value and the time value
    (millisecond offset from the [Epoch](#Epoch)) of
    this `Calendar` undefined. This means that [`isSet(field)`](#isSet(int)) will return `false`, and
    the date and time calculations will treat the field as if it
    had never been set. A `Calendar` implementation
    class may use the field's specific default value for date and
    time calculations.

    The [`HOUR_OF_DAY`](#HOUR_OF_DAY), [`HOUR`](#HOUR) and [`AM_PM`](#AM_PM)
    fields are handled independently and the [the resolution rule for the time of
    day](#time_resolution) is applied. Clearing one of the fields doesn't reset
    the hour of day value of this `Calendar`. Use [`set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 0)`](#set(int,int)) to reset the hour
    value.

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the calendar field to be cleared.

    See Also:
    :   - [`clear()`](#clear())
  + ### isSet

    public final boolean isSet(int field)

    Determines if the given calendar field has a value set,
    including cases that the value has been set by internal fields
    calculations triggered by a `get` method call.

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the calendar field to test

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the given calendar field has a value set;
        `false` otherwise.
  + ### getDisplayName

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getDisplayName(int field,
    int style,
    [Locale](Locale.md "class in java.util") locale)

    Returns the string representation of the calendar
    `field` value in the given `style` and
    `locale`. If no string representation is
    applicable, `null` is returned. This method calls
    [`get(field)`](#get(int)) to get the calendar
    `field` value if the string representation is
    applicable to the given calendar `field`.

    For example, if this `Calendar` is a
    `GregorianCalendar` and its date is 2005-01-01, then
    the string representation of the [`MONTH`](#MONTH) field would be
    "January" in the long style in an English locale or "Jan" in
    the short style. However, no string representation would be
    available for the [`DAY_OF_MONTH`](#DAY_OF_MONTH) field, and this method
    would return `null`.

    The default implementation supports the calendar fields for
    which a [`DateFormatSymbols`](../text/DateFormatSymbols.md "class in java.text") has names in the given
    `locale`.

    If there is no string representation of the `Calendar` `field`
    and the calendar is in non-lenient mode and any calendar fields have invalid values,
    `null` is returned. If there is a string representation of the `Calendar`
    `field` and the calendar is in non-lenient mode and any calendar fields
    have invalid values, `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown.

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the calendar field for which the string representation
        is returned
    :   `style` - the style applied to the string representation; one of [`SHORT_FORMAT`](#SHORT_FORMAT) ([`SHORT`](#SHORT)), [`SHORT_STANDALONE`](#SHORT_STANDALONE),
        [`LONG_FORMAT`](#LONG_FORMAT) ([`LONG`](#LONG)), [`LONG_STANDALONE`](#LONG_STANDALONE),
        [`NARROW_FORMAT`](#NARROW_FORMAT), or [`NARROW_STANDALONE`](#NARROW_STANDALONE).
    :   `locale` - the locale for the string representation
        (any calendar types specified by `locale` are ignored)

    Returns:
    :   the string representation of the given
        `field` in the given `style`, or
        `null` if no string representation is
        applicable.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `field` or `style` is invalid,
        or if this `Calendar` is non-lenient and any
        of the calendar fields have invalid values
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `locale` is null

    Since:
    :   1.6
  + ### getDisplayNames

    public [Map](Map.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang"),[Integer](../lang/Integer.md "class in java.lang")> getDisplayNames(int field,
    int style,
    [Locale](Locale.md "class in java.util") locale)

    Returns a `Map` containing all names of the calendar
    `field` in the given `style` and
    `locale` and their corresponding field values. For
    example, if this `Calendar` is a [`GregorianCalendar`](GregorianCalendar.md "class in java.util"), the returned map would contain "Jan" to
    [`JANUARY`](#JANUARY), "Feb" to [`FEBRUARY`](#FEBRUARY), and so on, in the
    [short](#SHORT) style in an English locale.

    Narrow names may not be unique due to use of single characters,
    such as "S" for Sunday and Saturday. In that case narrow names are not
    included in the returned `Map`.

    The values of other calendar fields may be taken into
    account to determine a set of display names. For example, if
    this `Calendar` is a lunisolar calendar system and
    the year value given by the [`YEAR`](#YEAR) field has a leap
    month, this method would return month names containing the leap
    month name, and month names are mapped to their values specific
    for the year.

    The default implementation supports display names contained in
    a [`DateFormatSymbols`](../text/DateFormatSymbols.md "class in java.text"). For example, if `field`
    is [`MONTH`](#MONTH) and `style` is [`ALL_STYLES`](#ALL_STYLES), this method returns a `Map` containing
    all strings returned by [`DateFormatSymbols.getShortMonths()`](../text/DateFormatSymbols.md#getShortMonths())
    and [`DateFormatSymbols.getMonths()`](../text/DateFormatSymbols.md#getMonths()).

    Unlike [`getDisplayName(int, int, Locale)`](#getDisplayName(int,int,java.util.Locale)), this
    method will not throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the
    `Calendar` is non-lenient and any of the calendar fields have
    invalid values. Instead, this method will return either `null` or
    a `Map`.

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the calendar field for which the display names are returned
    :   `style` - the style applied to the string representation; one of [`SHORT_FORMAT`](#SHORT_FORMAT) ([`SHORT`](#SHORT)), [`SHORT_STANDALONE`](#SHORT_STANDALONE),
        [`LONG_FORMAT`](#LONG_FORMAT) ([`LONG`](#LONG)), [`LONG_STANDALONE`](#LONG_STANDALONE),
        [`NARROW_FORMAT`](#NARROW_FORMAT), or [`NARROW_STANDALONE`](#NARROW_STANDALONE)
    :   `locale` - the locale for the display names

    Returns:
    :   a `Map` containing all display names in
        `style` and `locale` and their
        field values, or `null` if no display names
        are defined for `field`

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `field` or `style` is invalid
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `locale` is null

    Since:
    :   1.6
  + ### complete

    protected void complete()

    Fills in any unset fields in the calendar fields. First, the [`computeTime()`](#computeTime()) method is called if the time value (millisecond offset
    from the [Epoch](#Epoch)) has not been calculated from
    calendar field values. Then, the [`computeFields()`](#computeFields()) method is
    called to calculate all calendar field values.
  + ### getAvailableCalendarTypes

    public static [Set](Set.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> getAvailableCalendarTypes()

    Returns an unmodifiable `Set` containing all calendar types
    supported by `Calendar` in the runtime environment. The available
    calendar types can be used for the [Unicode locale extensions](Locale.md#def_locale_extension).
    The `Set` returned contains at least `"gregory"`. The
    calendar types don't include aliases, such as `"gregorian"` for
    `"gregory"`.

    Returns:
    :   an unmodifiable `Set` containing all available calendar types

  + ### getCalendarType

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getCalendarType()

    Returns the calendar type of this `Calendar`. Calendar types are
    defined by the *Unicode Locale Data Markup Language (LDML)*
    specification.

    The default implementation of this method returns the class name of
    this `Calendar` instance. Any subclasses that implement
    LDML-defined calendar systems should override this method to return
    appropriate calendar types.

    Returns:
    :   the LDML-defined calendar type or the class name of this
        `Calendar` instance

  + ### equals

    public boolean equals([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") obj)

    Compares this `Calendar` to the specified
    `Object`. The result is `true` if and only if
    the argument is a `Calendar` object of the same calendar
    system that represents the same time value (millisecond offset from the
    [Epoch](#Epoch)) under the same
    `Calendar` parameters as this object.

    The `Calendar` parameters are the values represented
    by the `isLenient`, `getFirstDayOfWeek`,
    `getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek` and `getTimeZone`
    methods. If there is any difference in those parameters
    between the two `Calendar`s, this method returns
    `false`.

    Use the [`compareTo`](#compareTo(java.util.Calendar)) method to
    compare only the time values.

    Overrides:
    :   `equals` in class `Object`

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - the object to compare with.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this object is equal to `obj`;
        `false` otherwise.

  + ### before

    public boolean before([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") when)

    Returns whether this `Calendar` represents a time
    before the time represented by the specified
    `Object`. This method is equivalent to:

    ```
             compareTo(when) < 0
    ```

    if and only if `when` is a `Calendar`
    instance. Otherwise, the method returns `false`.

    Parameters:
    :   `when` - the `Object` to be compared

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the time of this
        `Calendar` is before the time represented by
        `when`; `false` otherwise.

    :   - [`compareTo(Calendar)`](#compareTo(java.util.Calendar))
  + ### after

    public boolean after([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") when)

    Returns whether this `Calendar` represents a time
    after the time represented by the specified
    `Object`. This method is equivalent to:

    ```
             compareTo(when) > 0
    ```

    if and only if `when` is a `Calendar`
    instance. Otherwise, the method returns `false`.

    Parameters:
    :   `when` - the `Object` to be compared

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the time of this `Calendar` is
        after the time represented by `when`; `false`
        otherwise.

    See Also:
    :   - [`compareTo(Calendar)`](#compareTo(java.util.Calendar))
  + ### compareTo

    public int compareTo([Calendar](Calendar.md "class in java.util") anotherCalendar)

    Compares the time values (millisecond offsets from the [Epoch](#Epoch)) represented by two
    `Calendar` objects.

    Specified by:
    :   `compareTo` in interface `Comparable<Calendar>`

    Parameters:
    :   `anotherCalendar` - the `Calendar` to be compared.

    Returns:
    :   the value `0` if the time represented by the argument
        is equal to the time represented by this `Calendar`; a value
        less than `0` if the time of this `Calendar` is
        before the time represented by the argument; and a value greater than
        `0` if the time of this `Calendar` is after the
        time represented by the argument.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified `Calendar` is
        `null`.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the time value of the
        specified `Calendar` object can't be obtained due to
        any invalid calendar values.

    Since:
    :   1.5
  + ### add

    public abstract void add(int field,
    int amount)

    Adds or subtracts the specified amount of time to the given calendar field,
    based on the calendar's rules. For example, to subtract 5 days from
    the current time of the calendar, you can achieve it by calling:

    `add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, -5)`.

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the calendar field.
    :   `amount` - the amount of date or time to be added to the field.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if this `Calendar` is non-lenient
        and any of the calendar fields have invalid values or if `field` is
        `ZONE_OFFSET`, `DST_OFFSET`, or unknown.

        - [`set(int,int)`](#set(int,int))
  + ### roll

    public abstract void roll(int field,
    boolean up)

    Adds or subtracts (up/down) a single unit of time on the given time
    field without changing larger fields. For example, to roll the current
    date up by one day, you can achieve it by calling:

    roll(Calendar.DATE, true).
    When rolling on the year or Calendar.YEAR field, it will roll the year
    value in the range between 1 and the value returned by calling
    `getMaximum(Calendar.YEAR)`.
    When rolling on the month or Calendar.MONTH field, other fields like
    date might conflict and, need to be changed. For instance,
    rolling the month on the date 01/31/96 will result in 02/29/96.
    When rolling on the hour-in-day or Calendar.HOUR\_OF\_DAY field, it will
    roll the hour value in the range between 0 and 23, which is zero-based.

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the time field.
    :   `up` - indicates if the value of the specified time field is to be
        rolled up or rolled down. Use true if rolling up, false otherwise.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if this `Calendar` is non-lenient
        and any of the calendar fields have invalid values or if `field` is
        `ZONE_OFFSET`, `DST_OFFSET`, or unknown.

        - [`set(int,int)`](#set(int,int))
  + ### roll

    public void roll(int field,
    int amount)

    Adds the specified (signed) amount to the specified calendar field
    without changing larger fields. A negative amount means to roll
    down.

    NOTE: This default implementation on `Calendar` just repeatedly calls the
    version of [`roll()`](#roll(int,boolean)) that rolls by one unit. This may not
    always do the right thing. For example, if the `DAY_OF_MONTH` field is 31,
    rolling through February will leave it set to 28. The `GregorianCalendar`
    version of this function takes care of this problem. Other subclasses
    should also provide overrides of this function that do the right thing.

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the calendar field.
    :   `amount` - the signed amount to add to the calendar `field`.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if this `Calendar` is non-lenient
        and any of the calendar fields have invalid values or if `field` is
        `ZONE_OFFSET`, `DST_OFFSET`, or unknown.

  + ### setTimeZone

    public void setTimeZone([TimeZone](TimeZone.md "class in java.util") value)

    Sets the time zone with the given time zone value.

    Parameters:
    :   `value` - the given time zone.
  + ### getTimeZone

    public [TimeZone](TimeZone.md "class in java.util") getTimeZone()

    Gets the time zone.

    Returns:
    :   the time zone object associated with this calendar.
  + ### setLenient

    public void setLenient(boolean lenient)

    Specifies whether or not date/time interpretation is to be lenient. With
    lenient interpretation, a date such as "February 942, 1996" will be
    treated as being equivalent to the 941st day after February 1, 1996.
    With strict (non-lenient) interpretation, such dates will cause an exception to be
    thrown. The default is lenient.

    Parameters:
    :   `lenient` - `true` if the lenient mode is to be turned
        on; `false` if it is to be turned off.

  + ### setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek

    public void setMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(int value)

    Sets what the minimal days required in the first week of the year are;
    For example, if the first week is defined as one that contains the first
    day of the first month of a year, call this method with value 1. If it
    must be a full week, use value 7.

    Parameters:
    :   `value` - the given minimal days required in the first week
        of the year.

    e.g., if the first week is defined as one that contains the first day
    of the first month of a year, this method returns 1. If
    the minimal days required must be a full week, this method
    returns 7.

    Returns:
    :   the minimal days required in the first week of the year.

  + ### isWeekDateSupported

    public boolean isWeekDateSupported()

    Returns whether this `Calendar` supports week dates.

    The default implementation of this method returns `false`.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this `Calendar` supports week dates;

  + ### getWeekYear

    public int getWeekYear()

    Returns the week year represented by this `Calendar`. The
    week year is in sync with the week cycle. The [first day of the first week](#getFirstDayOfWeek()) is the first
    day of the week year.

    The default implementation of this method throws an
    [`UnsupportedOperationException`](../lang/UnsupportedOperationException.md "class in java.lang").

    Returns:
    :   the week year of this `Calendar`

    Throws:

  + ### setWeekDate

    public void setWeekDate(int weekYear,
    int weekOfYear,
    int dayOfWeek)

    Sets the date of this `Calendar` with the given date
    specifiers - week year, week of year, and day of week.

    Unlike the `set` method, all of the calendar fields
    and `time` values are calculated upon return.

    If `weekOfYear` is out of the valid week-of-year range
    in `weekYear`, the `weekYear` and `weekOfYear` values are adjusted in lenient mode, or an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown in non-lenient mode.

    The default implementation of this method throws an
    `UnsupportedOperationException`.

    Parameters:
    :   `weekYear` - the week year
    :   `weekOfYear` - the week number based on `weekYear`
    :   `dayOfWeek` - the day of week value: one of the constants
        for the [`DAY_OF_WEEK`](#DAY_OF_WEEK) field: [`SUNDAY`](#SUNDAY), ..., [`SATURDAY`](#SATURDAY).

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if any of the given date specifiers is invalid
        or any of the calendar fields are inconsistent
        with the given date specifiers in non-lenient mode
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if any week year numbering isn't supported in this
        `Calendar`.

    public abstract int getMinimum(int field)

    Returns the minimum value for the given calendar field of this
    `Calendar` instance. The minimum value is defined as
    the smallest value returned by the [`get`](#get(int)) method
    for any possible time value. The minimum value depends on
    calendar system specific parameters of the instance.

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the calendar field.

  + ### getMaximum

    public abstract int getMaximum(int field)

    Returns the maximum value for the given calendar field of this
    `Calendar` instance. The maximum value is defined as
    the largest value returned by the [`get`](#get(int)) method
    for any possible time value. The maximum value depends on
    calendar system specific parameters of the instance.

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the calendar field.

    public abstract int getGreatestMinimum(int field)

    Returns the highest minimum value for the given calendar field
    of this `Calendar` instance. The highest minimum
    value is defined as the largest value returned by [`getActualMinimum(int)`](#getActualMinimum(int)) for any possible time value. The
    greatest minimum value depends on calendar system specific
    parameters of the instance.

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the calendar field.

    Returns:
    :   the highest minimum value for the given calendar field.

  + ### getLeastMaximum

    public abstract int getLeastMaximum(int field)

    Returns the lowest maximum value for the given calendar field
    of this `Calendar` instance. The lowest maximum
    value is defined as the smallest value returned by [`getActualMaximum(int)`](#getActualMaximum(int)) for any possible time value. The least
    maximum value depends on calendar system specific parameters of
    the instance. For example, a `Calendar` for the
    Gregorian calendar system returns 28 for the
    `DAY_OF_MONTH` field, because the 28th is the last
    day of the shortest month of this calendar, February in a
    common year.

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the calendar field.

    Returns:
    :   the lowest maximum value for the given calendar field.

  + ### getActualMinimum

    public int getActualMinimum(int field)

    Returns the minimum value that the specified calendar field
    could have, given the time value of this `Calendar`.

    The default implementation of this method uses an iterative
    algorithm to determine the actual minimum value for the
    calendar field. Subclasses should, if possible, override this
    with a more efficient implementation - in many cases, they can
    simply return `getMinimum()`.

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the calendar field

    Returns:
    :   the minimum of the given calendar field for the time
        value of this `Calendar`

  + ### getActualMaximum

    public int getActualMaximum(int field)

    Returns the maximum value that the specified calendar field
    could have, given the time value of this
    `Calendar`. For example, the actual maximum value of
    the `MONTH` field is 12 in some years, and 13 in
    other years in the Hebrew calendar system.

    The default implementation of this method uses an iterative
    algorithm to determine the actual maximum value for the
    calendar field. Subclasses should, if possible, override this
    with a more efficient implementation.

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the calendar field

    Returns:
    :   the maximum of the given calendar field for the time
        value of this `Calendar`

    is intended to be used only for debugging purposes, and the
    format of the returned string may vary between implementations.
    The returned string may be empty but may not be `null`.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a string representation of this calendar.
  + ### toInstant

    public final [Instant](../time/Instant.md "class in java.time") toInstant()

    Converts this object to an [`Instant`](../time/Instant.md "class in java.time").

    The conversion creates an `Instant` that represents the
    same point on the time-line as this `Calendar`.

    Returns:
    :   the instant representing the same point on the time-line

    Since:
