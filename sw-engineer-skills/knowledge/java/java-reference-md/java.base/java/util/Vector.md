public class Vector<E>
extends [AbstractList](AbstractList.md "class in java.util")<E>
implements [List](List.md "interface in java.util")<E>, [RandomAccess](RandomAccess.md "interface in java.util"), [Cloneable](../lang/Cloneable.md "interface in java.lang"), [Serializable](../io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io")

The `Vector` class implements a growable array of
objects. Like an array, it contains components that can be
accessed using an integer index. However, the size of a
`Vector` can grow or shrink as needed to accommodate
adding and removing items after the `Vector` has been created.

Each vector tries to optimize storage management by maintaining a
`capacity` and a `capacityIncrement`. The
`capacity` is always at least as large as the vector
size; it is usually larger because as components are added to the
vector, the vector's storage increases in chunks the size of
`capacityIncrement`. An application can increase the
capacity of a vector before inserting a large number of
components; this reduces the amount of incremental reallocation.

The iterators returned by this class's [`iterator`](#iterator()) and
[`listIterator`](#listIterator(int)) methods are *fail-fast*:
if the vector is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is
created, in any way except through the iterator's own
[`remove`](ListIterator.md#remove()) or
[`add`](ListIterator.md#add(E)) methods, the iterator will throw a
[`ConcurrentModificationException`](ConcurrentModificationException.md "class in java.util"). Thus, in the face of
concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather
than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
time in the future. The [`Enumerations`](Enumeration.md "interface in java.util") returned by
the [`elements`](#elements()) method are *not* fail-fast; if the
Vector is structurally modified at any time after the enumeration is
created then the results of enumerating are undefined.

Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators
throw `ConcurrentModificationException` on a best-effort basis.
Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
exception for its correctness: *the fail-fast behavior of iterators
should be used only to detect bugs.*

As of the Java 2 platform v1.2, this class was retrofitted to
implement the [`List`](List.md "interface in java.util") interface, making it a member of the
[Java Collections Framework](../../../java.base/java/util/package-summary.md#CollectionsFramework). Unlike the new collection
implementations, `Vector` is synchronized. If a thread-safe
implementation is not needed, it is recommended to use [`ArrayList`](ArrayList.md "class in java.util") in place of `Vector`.

    with a smaller one. An application can use this operation to
    minimize the storage of a vector.
  + ### ensureCapacity

    public void ensureCapacity(int minCapacity)

    `capacityIncrement`, unless the value of
    `capacityIncrement` is less than or equal to zero, in which case

    vector to be the specified object. The previous component at that
    position is discarded.

    The index must be a value greater than or equal to `0`
    and less than the current size of the vector.

    This method is identical in functionality to the
    [`set(int, E)`](#set(int,E))
    method (which is part of the [`List`](List.md "interface in java.util") interface). Note that the
    `set` method reverses the order of the parameters, to more closely

  + ### removeElementAt

    public void removeElementAt(int index)

    Deletes the component at the specified index. Each component in
    this vector with an index greater or equal to the specified
    `index` is shifted downward to have an index one
    smaller than the value it had previously. The size of this vector
    is decreased by `1`.

    The index must be a value greater than or equal to `0`
    and less than the current size of the vector.

    This method is identical in functionality to the [`remove(int)`](#remove(int))
    method (which is part of the [`List`](List.md "interface in java.util") interface). Note that the
    `remove` method returns the old value that was stored at the
    specified position.

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - the index of the object to remove

    Throws:
    :   `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` - if the index is out of range
        (`index < 0 || index >= size()`)
  + ### insertElementAt

    public void insertElementAt([E](Vector.md "type parameter in Vector") obj,
    int index)

    Inserts the specified object as a component in this vector at the
    specified `index`. Each component in this vector with
    an index greater or equal to the specified `index` is
    shifted upward to have an index one greater than the value it had
    previously.

    The index must be a value greater than or equal to `0`
    and less than or equal to the current size of the vector. (If the
    index is equal to the current size of the vector, the new element
    is appended to the Vector.)

    This method is identical in functionality to the
    [`add(int, E)`](#add(int,E))
    method (which is part of the [`List`](List.md "interface in java.util") interface). Note that the
    `add` method reverses the order of the parameters, to more closely
    match array usage.

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - the component to insert
    :   `index` - where to insert the new component

    Throws:
    :   `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` - if the index is out of range
        (`index < 0 || index > size()`)
  + ### addElement

    public void addElement([E](Vector.md "type parameter in Vector") obj)

    Adds the specified component to the end of this vector,
    increasing its size by one. The capacity of this vector is
    increased if its size becomes greater than its capacity.

    This method is identical in functionality to the
    [`add(E)`](#add(E))
    method (which is part of the [`List`](List.md "interface in java.util") interface).

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - the component to be added
  + ### removeElement

    public boolean removeElement([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") obj)

    Removes the first (lowest-indexed) occurrence of the argument
    from this vector. If the object is found in this vector, each
    component in the vector with an index greater or equal to the
    object's index is shifted downward to have an index one smaller
    than the value it had previously.

    This method is identical in functionality to the
    [`remove(Object)`](#remove(java.lang.Object)) method (which is part of the
    [`List`](List.md "interface in java.util") interface).

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - the component to be removed

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the argument was a component of this
        vector; `false` otherwise.
  + ### removeAllElements

    public void removeAllElements()

    Removes all components from this vector and sets its size to zero.

    This method is identical in functionality to the [`clear()`](#clear())
    method (which is part of the [`List`](List.md "interface in java.util") interface).
  + ### clone

    public [Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") clone()

    reference to a clone of the internal data array, not a reference
    to the original internal data array of this `Vector` object.

    Overrides:
    :   `clone` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a clone of this vector

  + ### toArray

    public <T> T[] toArray(T[] a)

    Returns an array containing all of the elements in this Vector in the
    correct order; the runtime type of the returned array is that of the
    specified array. If the Vector fits in the specified array, it is
    returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime
    type of the specified array and the size of this Vector.

    If the Vector fits in the specified array with room to spare
    (i.e., the array has more elements than the Vector),
    the element in the array immediately following the end of the
    Vector is set to null. (This is useful in determining the length
    of the Vector *only* if the caller knows that the Vector
    does not contain any null elements.)

    Specified by:
    :   `toArray` in interface `Collection<E>`

        supertype of `<E>`.

    Parameters:
    :   `a` - the array into which the elements of the Vector are to
        be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
        same runtime type is allocated for this purpose.

    Returns:
    :   an array containing the elements of the Vector

    Throws:
    :   `ArrayStoreException` - if the runtime type of a, `<T>`, is not
        a supertype of the runtime type, `<E>`, of every element in this
        Vector
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the given array is null

    Removes the first occurrence of the specified element in this Vector
    If the Vector does not contain the element, it is unchanged. More
    formally, removes the element with the lowest index i such that

    Description copied from interface: `Collection`

    Removes all of the elements of this collection that satisfy the given
    predicate. Errors or runtime exceptions thrown during iteration or by
    the predicate are relayed to the caller.

    Inserts all of the elements in the specified Collection into this
    Vector at the specified position. Shifts the element currently at
    that position (if any) and any subsequent elements to the right
    (increases their indices). The new elements will appear in the Vector

  + ### equals

    public boolean equals([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") o)

    Compares the specified Object with this Vector for equality. Returns
    true if and only if the specified Object is also a List, both Lists
    have the same size, and all corresponding pairs of elements in the two
    Lists are *equal*. (Two elements `e1` and
    `e2` are *equal* if `Objects.equals(e1, e2)`.)
    In other words, two Lists are defined to be
    equal if they contain the same elements in the same order.

    Specified by:
    :   `equals` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Specified by:
    :   `equals` in interface `List<E>`

        - [`HashMap`](HashMap.md "class in java.util")
  + ### hashCode

    public int hashCode()

    Returns the hash code value for this Vector.

    Specified by:
    :   `hashCode` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Specified by:
    :   `hashCode` in interface `List<E>`

    Overrides:
    :   `hashCode` in class `AbstractList<E>`

    Returns:
    :   the hash code value for this list

    :   - [`Object.equals(java.lang.Object)`](../lang/Object.md#equals(java.lang.Object))
        - [`System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)`](../lang/System.md#identityHashCode(java.lang.Object))
  + ### toString

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Returns a string representation of this Vector, containing
    the String representation of each element.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `AbstractCollection<E>`

    Returns:
    :   a string representation of this collection
  + ### subList

    public [List](List.md "interface in java.util")<[E](Vector.md "type parameter in Vector")> subList(int fromIndex,
    int toIndex)

    Returns a view of the portion of this List between fromIndex,
    inclusive, and toIndex, exclusive. (If fromIndex and toIndex are
    equal, the returned List is empty.) The returned List is backed by this
    List, so changes in the returned List are reflected in this List, and
    vice-versa. The returned List supports all of the optional List
    operations supported by this List.

    This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of
    the sort that commonly exist for arrays). Any operation that expects
    a List can be used as a range operation by operating on a subList view
    instead of a whole List. For example, the following idiom
    removes a range of elements from a List:

    ```
          list.subList(from, to).clear();
    ```

    Similar idioms may be constructed for indexOf and lastIndexOf,
    and all of the algorithms in the Collections class can be applied to
    a subList.

    The semantics of the List returned by this method become undefined if
    the backing list (i.e., this List) is *structurally modified* in
    any way other than via the returned List. (Structural modifications are
    those that change the size of the List, or otherwise perturb it in such
    a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.)

    Specified by:
    :   `subList` in interface `List<E>`

    Overrides:
    :   `subList` in class `AbstractList<E>`

    Parameters:
    :   `fromIndex` - low endpoint (inclusive) of the subList
    :   `toIndex` - high endpoint (exclusive) of the subList

    Returns:
    :   a view of the specified range within this List

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if an endpoint index value is out of range
        `(fromIndex < 0 || toIndex > size)`
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the endpoint indices are out of order
        `(fromIndex > toIndex)`
  + ### removeRange

    protected void removeRange(int fromIndex,
    int toIndex)

    Removes from this list all of the elements whose index is between
    `fromIndex`, inclusive, and `toIndex`, exclusive.
    Shifts any succeeding elements to the left (reduces their index).
    This call shortens the list by `(toIndex - fromIndex)` elements.
    (If `toIndex==fromIndex`, this operation has no effect.)

    Overrides:
    :   `removeRange` in class `AbstractList<E>`

    Parameters:
    :   `fromIndex` - index of first element to be removed
    :   `toIndex` - index after last element to be removed
  + ### listIterator

    public [ListIterator](ListIterator.md "interface in java.util")<[E](Vector.md "type parameter in Vector")> listIterator(int index)

    Returns a list iterator over the elements in this list (in proper
    sequence), starting at the specified position in the list.
    The specified index indicates the first element that would be
    returned by an initial call to [`next`](ListIterator.md#next()).
    An initial call to [`previous`](ListIterator.md#previous()) would
    return the element with the specified index minus one.

    The returned list iterator is [*fail-fast*](#fail-fast).

    Returns:
    :   a list iterator over the elements in this list (in proper
        sequence), starting at the specified position in the list

  + ### forEach

    public void forEach([Consumer](function/Consumer.md "interface in java.util.function")<? super [E](Vector.md "type parameter in Vector")> action)

    Description copied from interface: `Iterable`

    Performs the given action for each element of the `Iterable`
    until all elements have been processed or the action throws an
    exception. Actions are performed in the order of iteration, if that
    order is specified. Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the
    caller.

    The behavior of this method is unspecified if the action performs
    side-effects that modify the underlying source of elements, unless an
    overriding class has specified a concurrent modification policy.

    Specified by:
    :   `forEach` in interface `Iterable<E>`

    Parameters:

    public void replaceAll([UnaryOperator](function/UnaryOperator.md "interface in java.util.function")<[E](Vector.md "type parameter in Vector")> operator)

    Description copied from interface: `List`

    Replaces each element of this list with the result of applying the
    operator to that element. Errors or runtime exceptions thrown by
    the operator are relayed to the caller.

    Specified by:
    :   `replaceAll` in interface `List<E>`

    Parameters:
    :   `operator` - the operator to apply to each element

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified operator is null or
        if the operator result is a null value and this list does
        not permit null elements
        ([optional](Collection.md#optional-restrictions))
  + ### sort

    public void sort([Comparator](Comparator.md "interface in java.util")<? super [E](Vector.md "type parameter in Vector")> c)

    Description copied from interface: `List`

    Sorts this list according to the order induced by the specified
    [`Comparator`](Comparator.md "interface in java.util"). The sort is *stable*: this method must not
    reorder equal elements.

    All elements in this list must be *mutually comparable* using the
    specified comparator (that is, `c.compare(e1, e2)` must not throw
    a `ClassCastException` for any elements `e1` and `e2`
    in the list).

    If the specified comparator is `null` then all elements in this
    list must implement the [`Comparable`](../lang/Comparable.md "interface in java.lang") interface and the elements'
    [natural ordering](../lang/Comparable.md "interface in java.lang") should be used.

    This list must be modifiable, but need not be resizable.

    Specified by:
    :   `sort` in interface `List<E>`

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - the `Comparator` used to compare list elements.
        A `null` value indicates that the elements'
        [natural ordering](../lang/Comparable.md "interface in java.lang") should be used
  + ### spliterator

    public [Spliterator](Spliterator.md "interface in java.util")<[E](Vector.md "type parameter in Vector")> spliterator()

    Creates a *[late-binding](Spliterator.md#binding)*
    and *fail-fast* [`Spliterator`](Spliterator.md "interface in java.util") over the elements in this
    list.

    The `Spliterator` reports [`Spliterator.SIZED`](Spliterator.md#SIZED),
    [`Spliterator.SUBSIZED`](Spliterator.md#SUBSIZED), and [`Spliterator.ORDERED`](Spliterator.md#ORDERED).
    Overriding implementations should document the reporting of additional
    characteristic values.

    Specified by:
    :   `spliterator` in interface `Collection<E>`

    Specified by:
    :   `spliterator` in interface `Iterable<E>`

    Specified by:
    :   `spliterator` in interface `List<E>`

    Returns:
    :   a `Spliterator` over the elements in this list
