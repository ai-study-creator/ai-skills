# Interface Future<V>

Type Parameters:
:   `V` - The result type returned by this Future's `get` method

All Known Subinterfaces:
:   `RunnableFuture<V>`, `RunnableScheduledFuture<V>`, `ScheduledFuture<V>`

All Known Implementing Classes:
:   `CompletableFuture`, `CountedCompleter`, `ForkJoinTask`, `FutureTask`, `RecursiveAction`, `RecursiveTask`, `SwingWorker`

---

public interface Future<V>

A `Future` represents the result of an asynchronous
computation. Methods are provided to check if the computation is
complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of
the computation. The result can only be retrieved using method
`get` when the computation has completed, blocking if
necessary until it is ready. Cancellation is performed by the
`cancel` method. Additional methods are provided to
determine if the task completed normally or was cancelled. Once a
computation has completed, the computation cannot be cancelled.
If you would like to use a `Future` for the sake
of cancellability but not provide a usable result, you can
declare types of the form `Future<?>` and
return `null` as a result of the underlying task.

**Sample Usage** (Note that the following classes are all
made-up.)

```
 interface ArchiveSearcher { String search(String target); }
 class App {
   ExecutorService executor = ...;
   ArchiveSearcher searcher = ...;
   void showSearch(String target) throws InterruptedException {
     Callable<String> task = () -> searcher.search(target);
     Future<String> future = executor.submit(task);
     displayOtherThings(); // do other things while searching
     try {
       displayText(future.get()); // use future
     } catch (ExecutionException ex) { cleanup(); return; }
   }
 }
```

The [`FutureTask`](FutureTask.md "class in java.util.concurrent") class is an implementation of `Future` that
implements `Runnable`, and so may be executed by an `Executor`.
For example, the above construction with `submit` could be replaced by:

```
 FutureTask<String> future = new FutureTask<>(task);
 executor.execute(future);
```

Memory consistency effects: Actions taken by the asynchronous computation
 [*happen-before*](package-summary.md#MemoryVisibility)
actions following the corresponding `Future.get()` in another thread.

* ## Method Details

  + ### cancel

    boolean cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning)

    Attempts to cancel execution of this task. This method has no
    effect if the task is already completed or cancelled, or could
    not be cancelled for some other reason. Otherwise, if this
    task has not started when `cancel` is called, this task
    should never run. If the task has already started, then the
    `mayInterruptIfRunning` parameter determines whether the
    thread executing this task (when known by the implementation)
    is interrupted in an attempt to stop the task.

    The return value from this method does not necessarily
    indicate whether the task is now cancelled; use [`isCancelled()`](#isCancelled()).

    Parameters:
    :   `mayInterruptIfRunning` - `true` if the thread
        executing this task should be interrupted (if the thread is
        known to the implementation); otherwise, in-progress tasks are
        allowed to complete

    Returns:
    :   `false` if the task could not be cancelled,
        typically because it has already completed; `true`
        otherwise. If two or more threads cause a task to be cancelled,
        then at least one of them returns `true`. Implementations
        may provide stronger guarantees.
  + ### isCancelled

    boolean isCancelled()

    Returns `true` if this task was cancelled before it completed
    normally.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this task was cancelled before it completed
  + ### isDone

    boolean isDone()

    Returns `true` if this task completed.
    Completion may be due to normal termination, an exception, or
    cancellation -- in all of these cases, this method will return
    `true`.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this task completed
  + ### get

    [V](Future.md "type parameter in Future") get()
    throws [InterruptedException](../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang"),
    [ExecutionException](ExecutionException.md "class in java.util.concurrent")

    Waits if necessary for the computation to complete, and then
    retrieves its result.

    Returns:
    :   the computed result

    Throws:
    :   `CancellationException` - if the computation was cancelled
    :   `ExecutionException` - if the computation threw an
        exception
    :   `InterruptedException` - if the current thread was interrupted
        while waiting
  + ### get

    [V](Future.md "type parameter in Future") get(long timeout,
    [TimeUnit](TimeUnit.md "enum class in java.util.concurrent") unit)
    throws [InterruptedException](../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang"),
    [ExecutionException](ExecutionException.md "class in java.util.concurrent"),
    [TimeoutException](TimeoutException.md "class in java.util.concurrent")

    Waits if necessary for at most the given time for the computation
    to complete, and then retrieves its result, if available.

    Parameters:
    :   `timeout` - the maximum time to wait
    :   `unit` - the time unit of the timeout argument

    Returns:
    :   the computed result

    Throws:
    :   `CancellationException` - if the computation was cancelled
    :   `ExecutionException` - if the computation threw an
        exception
    :   `InterruptedException` - if the current thread was interrupted
        while waiting
    :   `TimeoutException` - if the wait timed out
  + ### resultNow

    default [V](Future.md "type parameter in Future") resultNow()

    Returns the computed result, without waiting.

    This method is for cases where the caller knows that the task has
    already completed successfully, for example when filtering a stream
    of Future objects for the successful tasks and using a mapping
    operation to obtain a stream of results.

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        results = futures.stream()
                   .filter(f -> f.state() == Future.State.SUCCESS)
                   .map(Future::resultNow)
                   .toList();
    ```

    Returns:
    :   the computed result

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the task has not completed or the task
        did not complete with a result

    Since:
    :   19
  + ### exceptionNow

    default [Throwable](../../lang/Throwable.md "class in java.lang") exceptionNow()

    Returns the exception thrown by the task, without waiting.

    This method is for cases where the caller knows that the task
    has already completed with an exception.

    Returns:
    :   the exception thrown by the task

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the task has not completed, the task
        completed normally, or the task was cancelled

    Since:
    :   19
  + ### state

    default [Future.State](Future.State.md "enum class in java.util.concurrent") state()

    Returns the computation state.

    Returns:
    :   the computation state

    Since:
    :   19
