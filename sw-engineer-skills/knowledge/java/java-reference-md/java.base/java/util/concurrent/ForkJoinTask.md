public abstract class ForkJoinTask<V>
extends [Object](../../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Future](Future.md "interface in java.util.concurrent")<V>, [Serializable](../../io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io")

Abstract base class for tasks that run within a [`ForkJoinPool`](ForkJoinPool.md "class in java.util.concurrent").
A `ForkJoinTask` is a thread-like entity that is much
lighter weight than a normal thread. Huge numbers of tasks and
subtasks may be hosted by a small number of actual threads in a
ForkJoinPool, at the price of some usage limitations.

A "main" `ForkJoinTask` begins execution when it is
explicitly submitted to a [`ForkJoinPool`](ForkJoinPool.md "class in java.util.concurrent"), or, if not already
engaged in a ForkJoin computation, commenced in the [`ForkJoinPool.commonPool()`](ForkJoinPool.md#commonPool()) via [`fork()`](#fork()), [`invoke()`](#invoke()), or
related methods. Once started, it will usually in turn start other
subtasks. As indicated by the name of this class, many programs
using `ForkJoinTask` employ only methods [`fork()`](#fork()) and
[`join()`](#join()), or derivatives such as [`invokeAll`](#invokeAll(java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask...)). However, this class also
provides a number of other methods that can come into play in
advanced usages, as well as extension mechanics that allow support
of new forms of fork/join processing.

A `ForkJoinTask` is a lightweight form of [`Future`](Future.md "interface in java.util.concurrent").
The efficiency of `ForkJoinTask`s stems from a set of
restrictions (that are only partially statically enforceable)
reflecting their main use as computational tasks calculating pure
functions or operating on purely isolated objects. The primary
coordination mechanisms are [`fork()`](#fork()), that arranges
asynchronous execution, and [`join()`](#join()), that doesn't proceed
until the task's result has been computed. Computations should
ideally avoid `synchronized` methods or blocks, and should
minimize other blocking synchronization apart from joining other
tasks or using synchronizers such as Phasers that are advertised to
cooperate with fork/join scheduling. Subdividable tasks should also
not perform blocking I/O, and should ideally access variables that
are completely independent of those accessed by other running
tasks. These guidelines are loosely enforced by not permitting
checked exceptions such as `IOExceptions` to be
thrown. However, computations may still encounter unchecked
exceptions, that are rethrown to callers attempting to join
them. These exceptions may additionally include [`RejectedExecutionException`](RejectedExecutionException.md "class in java.util.concurrent") stemming from internal resource
exhaustion, such as failure to allocate internal task
queues. Rethrown exceptions behave in the same way as regular
exceptions, but, when possible, contain stack traces (as displayed
for example using `ex.printStackTrace()`) of both the thread
that initiated the computation as well as the thread actually
encountering the exception; minimally only the latter.

It is possible to define and use ForkJoinTasks that may block,
but doing so requires three further considerations: (1) Completion
of few if any *other* tasks should be dependent on a task
that blocks on external synchronization or I/O. Event-style async
tasks that are never joined (for example, those subclassing [`CountedCompleter`](CountedCompleter.md "class in java.util.concurrent")) often fall into this category. (2) To minimize
resource impact, tasks should be small; ideally performing only the
(possibly) blocking action. (3) Unless the [`ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker`](ForkJoinPool.ManagedBlocker.md "interface in java.util.concurrent") API is used, or the number of possibly
blocked tasks is known to be less than the pool's [`ForkJoinPool.getParallelism()`](ForkJoinPool.md#getParallelism()) level, the pool cannot guarantee that
enough threads will be available to ensure progress or good
performance.

The primary method for awaiting completion and extracting
results of a task is [`join()`](#join()), but there are several variants:
The [`Future.get()`](Future.md#get()) methods support interruptible and/or timed
waits for completion and report results using `Future`
conventions. Method [`invoke()`](#invoke()) is semantically
equivalent to `fork(); join()` but always attempts to begin
execution in the current thread. The "*quiet*" forms of
these methods do not extract results or report exceptions. These
may be useful when a set of tasks are being executed, and you need
to delay processing of results or exceptions until all complete.
Method `invokeAll` (available in multiple versions)
performs the most common form of parallel invocation: forking a set
of tasks and joining them all.

In the most typical usages, a fork-join pair act like a call
(fork) and return (join) from a parallel recursive function. As is
the case with other forms of recursive calls, returns (joins)
should be performed innermost-first. For example, `a.fork();
b.fork(); b.join(); a.join();` is likely to be substantially more
efficient than joining `a` before `b`.

The execution status of tasks may be queried at several levels
of detail: [`isDone()`](#isDone()) is true if a task completed in any way
(including the case where a task was cancelled without executing);
[`isCompletedNormally()`](#isCompletedNormally()) is true if a task completed without
cancellation or encountering an exception; [`isCancelled()`](#isCancelled()) is
true if the task was cancelled (in which case `getException(int)`
returns a [`CancellationException`](CancellationException.md "class in java.util.concurrent")); and
[`isCompletedAbnormally()`](#isCompletedAbnormally()) is true if a task was either
cancelled or encountered an exception, in which case `getException(int)` will return either the encountered exception or
[`CancellationException`](CancellationException.md "class in java.util.concurrent").

The ForkJoinTask class is not usually directly subclassed.
Instead, you subclass one of the abstract classes that support a
particular style of fork/join processing, typically [`RecursiveAction`](RecursiveAction.md "class in java.util.concurrent") for most computations that do not return results,
[`RecursiveTask`](RecursiveTask.md "class in java.util.concurrent") for those that do, and [`CountedCompleter`](CountedCompleter.md "class in java.util.concurrent") for those in which completed actions trigger
other actions. Normally, a concrete ForkJoinTask subclass declares
fields comprising its parameters, established in a constructor, and
then defines a `compute` method that somehow uses the control
methods supplied by this base class.

Method [`join()`](#join()) and its variants are appropriate for use
only when completion dependencies are acyclic; that is, the
parallel computation can be described as a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Otherwise, executions may encounter a form of deadlock as
tasks cyclically wait for each other. However, this framework
supports other methods and techniques (for example the use of
[`Phaser`](Phaser.md "class in java.util.concurrent"), [`helpQuiesce()`](#helpQuiesce()), and [`complete(V)`](#complete(V))) that
may be of use in constructing custom subclasses for problems that
are not statically structured as DAGs. To support such usages, a
ForkJoinTask may be atomically *tagged* with a `short`
value using [`setForkJoinTaskTag(short)`](#setForkJoinTaskTag(short)) or [`compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag(short, short)`](#compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag(short,short)) and checked using [`getForkJoinTaskTag()`](#getForkJoinTaskTag()). The ForkJoinTask implementation does not use
these `protected` methods or tags for any purpose, but they
may be of use in the construction of specialized subclasses. For
example, parallel graph traversals can use the supplied methods to
avoid revisiting nodes/tasks that have already been processed.
(Method names for tagging are bulky in part to encourage definition
of methods that reflect their usage patterns.)

Most base support methods are `final`, to prevent
overriding of implementations that are intrinsically tied to the
underlying lightweight task scheduling framework. Developers
creating new basic styles of fork/join processing should minimally
implement `protected` methods [`exec()`](#exec()), [`setRawResult(V)`](#setRawResult(V)), and [`getRawResult()`](#getRawResult()), while also introducing
an abstract computational method that can be implemented in its
subclasses, possibly relying on other `protected` methods
provided by this class.

ForkJoinTasks should perform relatively small amounts of
computation. Large tasks should be split into smaller subtasks,
usually via recursive decomposition. As a very rough rule of thumb,
a task should perform more than 100 and less than 10000 basic
computational steps, and should avoid indefinite looping. If tasks
are too big, then parallelism cannot improve throughput. If too
small, then memory and internal task maintenance overhead may
overwhelm processing.

This class provides `adapt` methods for [`Runnable`](../../lang/Runnable.md "interface in java.lang")
and [`Callable`](Callable.md "interface in java.util.concurrent"), that may be of use when mixing execution of
`ForkJoinTasks` with other kinds of tasks. When all tasks are
of this form, consider using a pool constructed in *asyncMode*.

ForkJoinTasks are `Serializable`, which enables them to be
used in extensions such as remote execution frameworks. It is
sensible to serialize tasks only before or after, but not during,
execution. Serialization is not relied on during execution itself.

  + ### fork

    public final [ForkJoinTask](ForkJoinTask.md "class in java.util.concurrent")<[V](ForkJoinTask.md "type parameter in ForkJoinTask")> fork()

    Arranges to asynchronously execute this task in the pool the
    current task is running in, if applicable, or using the [`ForkJoinPool.commonPool()`](ForkJoinPool.md#commonPool()) if not [`inForkJoinPool()`](#inForkJoinPool()). While
    it is not necessarily enforced, it is a usage error to fork a
    task more than once unless it has completed and been
    reinitialized. Subsequent modifications to the state of this
    task or any data it operates on are not necessarily
    consistently observable by any thread other than the one
    executing it unless preceded by a call to [`join()`](#join()) or
    related methods, or a call to [`isDone()`](#isDone()) returning `true`.

    Returns:
    :   `this`, to simplify usage
  + ### join

    public final [V](ForkJoinTask.md "type parameter in ForkJoinTask") join()

    Returns the result of the computation when it
    [is done](#isDone()).
    This method differs from [`get()`](#get()) in that abnormal
    completion results in `RuntimeException` or `Error`,
    not `ExecutionException`, and that interrupts of the
    calling thread do *not* cause the method to abruptly
    return by throwing `InterruptedException`.

    Returns:
    :   the computed result
  + ### invoke

    public final [V](ForkJoinTask.md "type parameter in ForkJoinTask") invoke()

    Commences performing this task, awaits its completion if
    necessary, and returns its result, or throws an (unchecked)
    `RuntimeException` or `Error` if the underlying
    computation did so.

    Returns:
    :   the computed result
  + ### invokeAll

    public static void invokeAll([ForkJoinTask](ForkJoinTask.md "class in java.util.concurrent")<?> t1,
    [ForkJoinTask](ForkJoinTask.md "class in java.util.concurrent")<?> t2)

    Forks the given tasks, returning when `isDone` holds for
    each task or an (unchecked) exception is encountered, in which
    case the exception is rethrown. If more than one task
    encounters an exception, then this method throws any one of
    these exceptions. If any task encounters an exception, the
    other may be cancelled. However, the execution status of
    individual tasks is not guaranteed upon exceptional return. The
    status of each task may be obtained using [`getException()`](#getException()) and related methods to check if they have been
    cancelled, completed normally or exceptionally, or left
    unprocessed.

    Parameters:
    :   `t1` - the first task
    :   `t2` - the second task

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if any task is null
  + ### invokeAll

    public static void invokeAll([ForkJoinTask](ForkJoinTask.md "class in java.util.concurrent")<?>... tasks)

    Forks the given tasks, returning when `isDone` holds for
    each task or an (unchecked) exception is encountered, in which
    case the exception is rethrown. If more than one task
    encounters an exception, then this method throws any one of
    these exceptions. If any task encounters an exception, others
    may be cancelled. However, the execution status of individual
    tasks is not guaranteed upon exceptional return. The status of
    each task may be obtained using [`getException()`](#getException()) and
    related methods to check if they have been cancelled, completed
    normally or exceptionally, or left unprocessed.

    Parameters:
    :   `tasks` - the tasks

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if any task is null
  + ### invokeAll

    public static <T extends [ForkJoinTask](ForkJoinTask.md "class in java.util.concurrent")<?>>
    [Collection](../Collection.md "interface in java.util")<T> invokeAll([Collection](../Collection.md "interface in java.util")<T> tasks)

    Forks all tasks in the specified collection, returning when
    `isDone` holds for each task or an (unchecked) exception
    is encountered, in which case the exception is rethrown. If
    more than one task encounters an exception, then this method
    throws any one of these exceptions. If any task encounters an
    exception, others may be cancelled. However, the execution
    status of individual tasks is not guaranteed upon exceptional
    return. The status of each task may be obtained using [`getException()`](#getException()) and related methods to check if they have been
    cancelled, completed normally or exceptionally, or left
    unprocessed.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the values returned from the tasks

    Parameters:
    :   `tasks` - the collection of tasks

    Returns:
    :   the tasks argument, to simplify usage

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if tasks or any element are null
  + ### cancel

    public boolean cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning)

    Attempts to cancel execution of this task. This attempt will
    fail if the task has already completed or could not be
    cancelled for some other reason. If successful, and this task
    has not started when `cancel` is called, execution of
    this task is suppressed. After this method returns
    successfully, unless there is an intervening call to [`reinitialize()`](#reinitialize()), subsequent calls to [`isCancelled()`](#isCancelled()),
    [`isDone()`](#isDone()), and `cancel` will return `true`
    and calls to [`join()`](#join()) and related methods will result in
    `CancellationException`.

    This method may be overridden in subclasses, but if so, must
    still ensure that these properties hold. In particular, the
    `cancel` method itself must not throw exceptions.

    This method is designed to be invoked by *other*
    tasks. To terminate the current task, you can just return or
    throw an unchecked exception from its computation method, or
    invoke [`completeExceptionally(Throwable)`](#completeExceptionally(java.lang.Throwable)).

    Specified by:
    :   `cancel` in interface `Future<V>`

    Parameters:
    :   `mayInterruptIfRunning` - this value has no effect in the
        default implementation because interrupts are not used to
        control cancellation.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this task is now cancelled
  + ### isDone

    public final boolean isDone()

    Description copied from interface: `Future`

    Returns `true` if this task completed.
    Completion may be due to normal termination, an exception, or
    cancellation -- in all of these cases, this method will return
    `true`.

    Specified by:
    :   `isDone` in interface `Future<V>`

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this task completed
  + ### isCancelled

    Description copied from interface: `Future`

    Returns `true` if this task was cancelled before it completed
    normally.

    Specified by:
    :   `isCancelled` in interface `Future<V>`

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this task was cancelled before it completed
  + ### isCompletedAbnormally

    public final boolean isCompletedAbnormally()

    Returns `true` if this task threw an exception or was cancelled.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this task threw an exception or was cancelled
  + ### isCompletedNormally

    public final boolean isCompletedNormally()

    Returns `true` if this task completed without throwing an
    exception and was not cancelled.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this task completed without throwing an
        exception and was not cancelled
  + ### state

    public [Future.State](Future.State.md "enum class in java.util.concurrent") state()

    Description copied from interface: `Future`

    Returns the computation state.

    Specified by:
    :   `state` in interface `Future<V>`

    Returns:
    :   the computation state
  + ### resultNow

    public [V](ForkJoinTask.md "type parameter in ForkJoinTask") resultNow()

    Description copied from interface: `Future`

    Returns the computed result, without waiting.

    This method is for cases where the caller knows that the task has
    already completed successfully, for example when filtering a stream
    of Future objects for the successful tasks and using a mapping
    operation to obtain a stream of results.

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        results = futures.stream()
                   .filter(f -> f.state() == Future.State.SUCCESS)
                   .map(Future::resultNow)
                   .toList();
    ```

    Specified by:
    :   `resultNow` in interface `Future<V>`

    Returns:
    :   the computed result
  + ### exceptionNow

    public [Throwable](../../lang/Throwable.md "class in java.lang") exceptionNow()

    Description copied from interface: `Future`

    Returns the exception thrown by the task, without waiting.

    This method is for cases where the caller knows that the task
    has already completed with an exception.

    Specified by:
    :   `exceptionNow` in interface `Future<V>`

    Returns:
    :   the exception thrown by the task
  + ### getException

    public final [Throwable](../../lang/Throwable.md "class in java.lang") getException()

    Returns the exception thrown by the base computation, or a
    `CancellationException` if cancelled, or `null` if
    none or if the method has not yet completed.

    Returns:
    :   the exception, or `null` if none
  + ### completeExceptionally

    public void completeExceptionally([Throwable](../../lang/Throwable.md "class in java.lang") ex)

    Completes this task abnormally, and if not already aborted or
    cancelled, causes it to throw the given exception upon
    `join` and related operations. This method may be used
    to induce exceptions in asynchronous tasks, or to force
    completion of tasks that would not otherwise complete. Its use
    in other situations is discouraged. This method is
    overridable, but overridden versions must invoke `super`
    implementation to maintain guarantees.

    Parameters:
    :   `ex` - the exception to throw. If this exception is not a
        `RuntimeException` or `Error`, the actual exception
        thrown will be a `RuntimeException` with cause `ex`.
  + ### complete

    public void complete([V](ForkJoinTask.md "type parameter in ForkJoinTask") value)

    Completes this task, and if not already aborted or cancelled,
    returning the given value as the result of subsequent
    invocations of `join` and related operations. This method
    may be used to provide results for asynchronous tasks, or to
    provide alternative handling for tasks that would not otherwise
    complete normally. Its use in other situations is
    discouraged. This method is overridable, but overridden
    versions must invoke `super` implementation to maintain
    guarantees.

    Parameters:
    :   `value` - the result value for this task
  + ### quietlyComplete

    public final void quietlyComplete()

    Completes this task normally without setting a value. The most
    recent value established by [`setRawResult(V)`](#setRawResult(V)) (or `null` by default) will be returned as the result of subsequent
    invocations of `join` and related operations.

    Since:
    :   1.8
  + ### get

    public final [V](ForkJoinTask.md "type parameter in ForkJoinTask") get()
    throws [InterruptedException](../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang"),
    [ExecutionException](ExecutionException.md "class in java.util.concurrent")

    Waits if necessary for the computation to complete, and then
    retrieves its result.

    Returns:
    :   the computed result

    Throws:
    :   `CancellationException` - if the computation was cancelled
    :   `ExecutionException` - if the computation threw an
        exception
    :   `InterruptedException` - if the current thread is not a
        member of a ForkJoinPool and was interrupted while waiting
  + ### get

    public final [V](ForkJoinTask.md "type parameter in ForkJoinTask") get(long timeout,
    [TimeUnit](TimeUnit.md "enum class in java.util.concurrent") unit)
    throws [InterruptedException](../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang"),
    [ExecutionException](ExecutionException.md "class in java.util.concurrent"),
    [TimeoutException](TimeoutException.md "class in java.util.concurrent")

    Waits if necessary for at most the given time for the computation
    to complete, and then retrieves its result, if available.

    Specified by:
    :   `get` in interface `Future<V>`

    Parameters:
    :   `timeout` - the maximum time to wait
    :   `unit` - the time unit of the timeout argument

    Returns:
    :   the computed result

    Throws:
    :   `CancellationException` - if the computation was cancelled
    :   `ExecutionException` - if the computation threw an
        exception
    :   `InterruptedException` - if the current thread is not a
        member of a ForkJoinPool and was interrupted while waiting
    :   `TimeoutException` - if the wait timed out
  + ### quietlyJoin

    public final void quietlyJoin()

    Joins this task, without returning its result or throwing its
    exception. This method may be useful when processing
    collections of tasks when some have been cancelled or otherwise
    known to have aborted.
  + ### quietlyInvoke

    public final void quietlyInvoke()

    Commences performing this task and awaits its completion if
    necessary, without returning its result or throwing its
    exception.
  + ### quietlyJoin

    public final boolean quietlyJoin(long timeout,
    [TimeUnit](TimeUnit.md "enum class in java.util.concurrent") unit)
    throws [InterruptedException](../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang")

    Tries to join this task, returning true if it completed
    (possibly exceptionally) before the given timeout and
    the current thread has not been interrupted.

    Parameters:
    :   `timeout` - the maximum time to wait
    :   `unit` - the time unit of the timeout argument

    Returns:
    :   true if this task completed

  + ### quietlyJoinUninterruptibly

    public final boolean quietlyJoinUninterruptibly(long timeout,
    [TimeUnit](TimeUnit.md "enum class in java.util.concurrent") unit)

    Tries to join this task, returning true if it completed
    (possibly exceptionally) before the given timeout.

    Parameters:
    :   `timeout` - the maximum time to wait
    :   `unit` - the time unit of the timeout argument

    Returns:
    :   true if this task completed

    Since:
    :   19
  + ### helpQuiesce

    public static void helpQuiesce()

    Possibly executes tasks until the pool hosting the current task
    [is quiescent](ForkJoinPool.md#isQuiescent()). This
    method may be of use in designs in which many tasks are forked,
    but none are explicitly joined, instead executing them until
    all are processed.
  + ### reinitialize

    public void reinitialize()

    Resets the internal bookkeeping state of this task, allowing a
    subsequent `fork`. This method allows repeated reuse of
    this task, but only if reuse occurs when this task has either
    never been forked, or has been forked, then completed and all
    outstanding joins of this task have also completed. Effects
    under any other usage conditions are not guaranteed.
    This method may be useful when executing
    pre-constructed trees of subtasks in loops.

    Upon completion of this method, `isDone()` reports
    `false`, and `getException()` reports `null`. However, the value returned by `getRawResult` is
    unaffected. To clear this value, you can invoke `setRawResult(null)`.
  + ### getPool

    public static [ForkJoinPool](ForkJoinPool.md "class in java.util.concurrent") getPool()

    Returns the pool hosting the current thread, or `null`
    if the current thread is executing outside of any ForkJoinPool.

    This method returns `null` if and only if [`inForkJoinPool()`](#inForkJoinPool()) returns `false`.

    Returns:
    :   the pool, or `null` if none
  + ### inForkJoinPool

    public static boolean inForkJoinPool()

    Returns `true` if the current thread is a [`ForkJoinWorkerThread`](ForkJoinWorkerThread.md "class in java.util.concurrent") executing as a ForkJoinPool computation.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the current thread is a [`ForkJoinWorkerThread`](ForkJoinWorkerThread.md "class in java.util.concurrent") executing as a ForkJoinPool computation,
        or `false` otherwise
  + ### tryUnfork

    public boolean tryUnfork()

    Tries to unschedule this task for execution. This method will
    typically (but is not guaranteed to) succeed if this task is
    the most recently forked task by the current thread, and has
    not commenced executing in another thread. This method may be
    useful when arranging alternative local processing of tasks
    that could have been, but were not, stolen.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if unforked
  + ### getQueuedTaskCount

    public static int getQueuedTaskCount()

    Returns an estimate of the number of tasks that have been
    forked by the current worker thread but not yet executed. This
    value may be useful for heuristic decisions about whether to
    fork other tasks.

    Returns:
    :   the number of tasks
  + ### getSurplusQueuedTaskCount

    public static int getSurplusQueuedTaskCount()

    Returns an estimate of how many more locally queued tasks are
    held by the current worker thread than there are other worker
    threads that might steal them, or zero if this thread is not
    operating in a ForkJoinPool. This value may be useful for
    heuristic decisions about whether to fork other tasks. In many
    usages of ForkJoinTasks, at steady state, each worker should
    aim to maintain a small constant surplus (for example, 3) of
    tasks, and to process computations locally if this threshold is
    exceeded.

    Returns:
    :   the surplus number of tasks, which may be negative
  + ### getRawResult

    public abstract [V](ForkJoinTask.md "type parameter in ForkJoinTask") getRawResult()

    Returns the result that would be returned by [`join()`](#join()), even
    if this task completed abnormally, or `null` if this task
    is not known to have been completed. This method is designed
    to aid debugging, as well as to support extensions. Its use in
    any other context is discouraged.

    Returns:
    :   the result, or `null` if not completed
  + ### setRawResult

    protected abstract void setRawResult([V](ForkJoinTask.md "type parameter in ForkJoinTask") value)

    Forces the given value to be returned as a result. This method
    is designed to support extensions, and should not in general be
    called otherwise.

    Parameters:
    :   `value` - the value
  + ### exec

    protected abstract boolean exec()

    Immediately performs the base action of this task and returns
    true if, upon return from this method, this task is guaranteed
    to have completed. This method may return false otherwise, to
    indicate that this task is not necessarily complete (or is not
    known to be complete), for example in asynchronous actions that
    require explicit invocations of completion methods. This method
    may also throw an (unchecked) exception to indicate abnormal
    exit. This method is designed to support extensions, and should
    not in general be called otherwise.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this task is known to have completed normally
  + ### peekNextLocalTask

    protected static [ForkJoinTask](ForkJoinTask.md "class in java.util.concurrent")<?> peekNextLocalTask()

    Returns, but does not unschedule or execute, a task queued by
    the current thread but not yet executed, if one is immediately
    available. There is no guarantee that this task will actually
    be polled or executed next. Conversely, this method may return
    null even if a task exists but cannot be accessed without
    contention with other threads. This method is designed
    primarily to support extensions, and is unlikely to be useful
    otherwise.

    Returns:
    :   the next task, or `null` if none are available
  + ### pollNextLocalTask

    protected static [ForkJoinTask](ForkJoinTask.md "class in java.util.concurrent")<?> pollNextLocalTask()

    Unschedules and returns, without executing, the next task
    queued by the current thread but not yet executed, if the
    current thread is operating in a ForkJoinPool. This method is
    designed primarily to support extensions, and is unlikely to be
    useful otherwise.

    Returns:
    :   the next task, or `null` if none are available
  + ### pollTask

    protected static [ForkJoinTask](ForkJoinTask.md "class in java.util.concurrent")<?> pollTask()

    If the current thread is operating in a ForkJoinPool,
    unschedules and returns, without executing, the next task
    queued by the current thread but not yet executed, if one is
    available, or if not available, a task that was forked by some
    other thread, if available. Availability may be transient, so a
    `null` result does not necessarily imply quiescence of
    the pool this task is operating in. This method is designed
    primarily to support extensions, and is unlikely to be useful
    otherwise.

    Returns:
    :   a task, or `null` if none are available
  + ### pollSubmission

    protected static [ForkJoinTask](ForkJoinTask.md "class in java.util.concurrent")<?> pollSubmission()

    If the current thread is operating in a ForkJoinPool,
    unschedules and returns, without executing, a task externally
    submitted to the pool, if one is available. Availability may be
    transient, so a `null` result does not necessarily imply
    quiescence of the pool. This method is designed primarily to
    support extensions, and is unlikely to be useful otherwise.

    Returns:
    :   a task, or `null` if none are available

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### getForkJoinTaskTag

    public final short getForkJoinTaskTag()

    Returns the tag for this task.

    Returns:
    :   the tag for this task

    Since:
    :   1.8
  + ### setForkJoinTaskTag

    public final short setForkJoinTaskTag(short newValue)

    Atomically sets the tag value for this task and returns the old value.

    Parameters:
    :   `newValue` - the new tag value

    Returns:
    :   the previous value of the tag

    Since:
    :   1.8
  + ### compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag

    public final boolean compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag(short expect,
    short update)

    Atomically conditionally sets the tag value for this task.
    Among other applications, tags can be used as visit markers
    in tasks operating on graphs, as in methods that check: `if (task.compareAndSetForkJoinTaskTag((short)0, (short)1))`
    before processing, otherwise exiting because the node has
    already been visited.

    Parameters:
    :   `expect` - the expected tag value
    :   `update` - the new tag value

    Returns:
    :   `true` if successful; i.e., the current value was
        equal to `expect` and was changed to `update`.

    Since:
    :   1.8
