public class ThreadPoolExecutor
extends [AbstractExecutorService](AbstractExecutorService.md "class in java.util.concurrent")

An [`ExecutorService`](ExecutorService.md "interface in java.util.concurrent") that executes each submitted task using
one of possibly several pooled threads, normally configured
using [`Executors`](Executors.md "class in java.util.concurrent") factory methods.

Thread pools address two different problems: they usually
provide improved performance when executing large numbers of
asynchronous tasks, due to reduced per-task invocation overhead,
and they provide a means of bounding and managing the resources,
including threads, consumed when executing a collection of tasks.
Each `ThreadPoolExecutor` also maintains some basic
statistics, such as the number of completed tasks.

To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class
provides many adjustable parameters and extensibility
hooks. However, programmers are urged to use the more convenient
[`Executors`](Executors.md "class in java.util.concurrent") factory methods [`Executors.newCachedThreadPool()`](Executors.md#newCachedThreadPool()) (unbounded thread pool, with
automatic thread reclamation), [`Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int)`](Executors.md#newFixedThreadPool(int))
(fixed size thread pool) and [`Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()`](Executors.md#newSingleThreadExecutor()) (single background thread), that
preconfigure settings for the most common usage
scenarios. Otherwise, use the following guide when manually
configuring and tuning this class:

Core and maximum pool sizes
:   A `ThreadPoolExecutor` will automatically adjust the
    pool size (see [`getPoolSize()`](#getPoolSize()))
    according to the bounds set by
    corePoolSize (see [`getCorePoolSize()`](#getCorePoolSize())) and
    maximumPoolSize (see [`getMaximumPoolSize()`](#getMaximumPoolSize())).
    When a new task is submitted in method [`execute(Runnable)`](#execute(java.lang.Runnable)),
    if fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, a new thread is
    created to handle the request, even if other worker threads are
    idle. Else if fewer than maximumPoolSize threads are running, a
    new thread will be created to handle the request only if the queue
    is full. By setting corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize the same, you
    create a fixed-size thread pool. By setting maximumPoolSize to an
    essentially unbounded value such as `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, you
    allow the pool to accommodate an arbitrary number of concurrent
    tasks. Most typically, core and maximum pool sizes are set only
    upon construction, but they may also be changed dynamically using
    [`setCorePoolSize(int)`](#setCorePoolSize(int)) and [`setMaximumPoolSize(int)`](#setMaximumPoolSize(int)).

On-demand construction
:   By default, even core threads are initially created and
    started only when new tasks arrive, but this can be overridden
    dynamically using method [`prestartCoreThread()`](#prestartCoreThread()) or [`prestartAllCoreThreads()`](#prestartAllCoreThreads()). You probably want to prestart threads if
    you construct the pool with a non-empty queue.

Creating new threads
:   New threads are created using a [`ThreadFactory`](ThreadFactory.md "interface in java.util.concurrent"). If not
    otherwise specified, a [`Executors.defaultThreadFactory()`](Executors.md#defaultThreadFactory()) is
    used, that creates threads to all be in the same [`ThreadGroup`](../../lang/ThreadGroup.md "class in java.lang") and with the same `NORM_PRIORITY` priority and
    non-daemon status. By supplying a different ThreadFactory, you can
    alter the thread's name, thread group, priority, daemon status,
    etc. If a `ThreadFactory` fails to create a thread when asked
    by returning null from `newThread`, the executor will
    continue, but might not be able to execute any tasks. Threads
    should possess the "modifyThread" `RuntimePermission`. If
    worker threads or other threads using the pool do not possess this
    permission, service may be degraded: configuration changes may not
    take effect in a timely manner, and a shutdown pool may remain in a
    state in which termination is possible but not completed.

Keep-alive times
:   If the pool currently has more than corePoolSize threads,
    excess threads will be terminated if they have been idle for more
    than the keepAliveTime (see [`getKeepAliveTime(TimeUnit)`](#getKeepAliveTime(java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit))).
    This provides a means of reducing resource consumption when the
    pool is not being actively used. If the pool becomes more active
    later, new threads will be constructed. This parameter can also be
    changed dynamically using method [`setKeepAliveTime(long, TimeUnit)`](#setKeepAliveTime(long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)). Using a value of `Long.MAX_VALUE` [`TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS`](TimeUnit.md#NANOSECONDS) effectively disables idle threads from ever
    terminating prior to shut down. By default, the keep-alive policy
    applies only when there are more than corePoolSize threads, but
    method [`allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)`](#allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)) can be used to
    apply this time-out policy to core threads as well, so long as the
    keepAliveTime value is non-zero.

Queuing
:   Any [`BlockingQueue`](BlockingQueue.md "interface in java.util.concurrent") may be used to transfer and hold
    submitted tasks. The use of this queue interacts with pool sizing:

    * If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, the Executor
      always prefers adding a new thread
      rather than queuing.* If corePoolSize or more threads are running, the Executor
        always prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new
        thread.* If a request cannot be queued, a new thread is created unless
          this would exceed maximumPoolSize, in which case, the task will be
          rejected.

    There are three general strategies for queuing:

    1. *Direct handoffs.* A good default choice for a work
       queue is a [`SynchronousQueue`](SynchronousQueue.md "class in java.util.concurrent") that hands off tasks to threads
       without otherwise holding them. Here, an attempt to queue a task
       will fail if no threads are immediately available to run it, so a
       new thread will be constructed. This policy avoids lockups when
       handling sets of requests that might have internal dependencies.
       Direct handoffs generally require unbounded maximumPoolSizes to
       avoid rejection of new submitted tasks. This in turn admits the
       possibility of unbounded thread growth when commands continue to
       arrive on average faster than they can be processed.- *Unbounded queues.* Using an unbounded queue (for
         example a [`LinkedBlockingQueue`](LinkedBlockingQueue.md "class in java.util.concurrent") without a predefined
         capacity) will cause new tasks to wait in the queue when all
         corePoolSize threads are busy. Thus, no more than corePoolSize
         threads will ever be created. (And the value of the maximumPoolSize
         therefore doesn't have any effect.) This may be appropriate when
         each task is completely independent of others, so tasks cannot
         affect each others execution; for example, in a web page server.
         While this style of queuing can be useful in smoothing out
         transient bursts of requests, it admits the possibility of
         unbounded work queue growth when commands continue to arrive on
         average faster than they can be processed.- *Bounded queues.* A bounded queue (for example, an
           [`ArrayBlockingQueue`](ArrayBlockingQueue.md "class in java.util.concurrent")) helps prevent resource exhaustion when
           used with finite maximumPoolSizes, but can be more difficult to
           tune and control. Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes may be traded
           off for each other: Using large queues and small pools minimizes
           CPU usage, OS resources, and context-switching overhead, but can
           lead to artificially low throughput. If tasks frequently block (for
           example if they are I/O bound), a system may be able to schedule
           time for more threads than you otherwise allow. Use of small queues
           generally requires larger pool sizes, which keeps CPUs busier but
           may encounter unacceptable scheduling overhead, which also
           decreases throughput.

Rejected tasks
:   New tasks submitted in method [`execute(Runnable)`](#execute(java.lang.Runnable)) will be
    *rejected* when the Executor has been shut down, and also when
    the Executor uses finite bounds for both maximum threads and work queue
    capacity, and is saturated. In either case, the `execute` method
    invokes the [`RejectedExecutionHandler.rejectedExecution(Runnable, ThreadPoolExecutor)`](RejectedExecutionHandler.md#rejectedExecution(java.lang.Runnable,java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor))
    method of its [`RejectedExecutionHandler`](RejectedExecutionHandler.md "interface in java.util.concurrent"). Four predefined handler
    policies are provided:

    1. In the default [`ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy`](ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy.md "class in java.util.concurrent"), the handler
       throws a runtime [`RejectedExecutionException`](RejectedExecutionException.md "class in java.util.concurrent") upon rejection.- In [`ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy`](ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy.md "class in java.util.concurrent"), the thread
         that invokes `execute` itself runs the task. This provides a
         simple feedback control mechanism that will slow down the rate that
         new tasks are submitted.- In [`ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy`](ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy.md "class in java.util.concurrent"), a task that cannot
           be executed is simply dropped. This policy is designed only for
           those rare cases in which task completion is never relied upon.- In [`ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy`](ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy.md "class in java.util.concurrent"), if the
             executor is not shut down, the task at the head of the work queue
             is dropped, and then execution is retried (which can fail again,
             causing this to be repeated.) This policy is rarely acceptable. In
             nearly all cases, you should also cancel the task to cause an
             exception in any component waiting for its completion, and/or log
             the failure, as illustrated in [`ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy`](ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy.md "class in java.util.concurrent") documentation.

    It is possible to define and use other kinds of [`RejectedExecutionHandler`](RejectedExecutionHandler.md "interface in java.util.concurrent") classes. Doing so requires some care
    especially when policies are designed to work only under particular
    capacity or queuing policies.

Hook methods
:   This class provides `protected` overridable
    [`beforeExecute(Thread, Runnable)`](#beforeExecute(java.lang.Thread,java.lang.Runnable)) and
    [`afterExecute(Runnable, Throwable)`](#afterExecute(java.lang.Runnable,java.lang.Throwable)) methods that are called
    before and after execution of each task. These can be used to
    manipulate the execution environment; for example, reinitializing
    ThreadLocals, gathering statistics, or adding log entries.
    Additionally, method [`terminated()`](#terminated()) can be overridden to perform
    any special processing that needs to be done once the Executor has
    fully terminated.

    If hook, callback, or BlockingQueue methods throw exceptions,
    internal worker threads may in turn fail, abruptly terminate, and
    possibly be replaced.

Queue maintenance
:   Method [`getQueue()`](#getQueue()) allows access to the work queue
    for purposes of monitoring and debugging. Use of this method for
    any other purpose is strongly discouraged. Two supplied methods,
    [`remove(Runnable)`](#remove(java.lang.Runnable)) and [`purge()`](#purge()) are available to
    assist in storage reclamation when large numbers of queued tasks
    become cancelled.

Reclamation
:   A pool that is no longer referenced in a program *AND*
    has no remaining threads may be reclaimed (garbage collected)
    without being explicitly shutdown. You can configure a pool to
    allow all unused threads to eventually die by setting appropriate
    keep-alive times, using a lower bound of zero core threads and/or
    setting [`allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)`](#allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)).

**Extension example.** Most extensions of this class
override one or more of the protected hook methods. For example,
here is a subclass that adds a simple pause/resume feature:

```
 class PausableThreadPoolExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor {
   private boolean isPaused;
   private ReentrantLock pauseLock = new ReentrantLock();
   private Condition unpaused = pauseLock.newCondition();

   public PausableThreadPoolExecutor(...) { super(...); }

   protected void beforeExecute(Thread t, Runnable r) {
     super.beforeExecute(t, r);
     pauseLock.lock();
     try {
       while (isPaused) unpaused.await();
     } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
       t.interrupt();
     } finally {
       pauseLock.unlock();
     }
   }

   public void pause() {
     pauseLock.lock();
     try {
       isPaused = true;
     } finally {
       pauseLock.unlock();
     }
   }

   public void resume() {
     pauseLock.lock();
     try {
       isPaused = false;
       unpaused.signalAll();
     } finally {
       pauseLock.unlock();
     }
   }
 }
```

* ## Method Details

  + ### execute

    public void execute([Runnable](../../lang/Runnable.md "interface in java.lang") command)

    Executes the given task sometime in the future. The task
    may execute in a new thread or in an existing pooled thread.
    If the task cannot be submitted for execution, either because this
    executor has been shutdown or because its capacity has been reached,
    the task is handled by the current [`RejectedExecutionHandler`](RejectedExecutionHandler.md "interface in java.util.concurrent").

    Parameters:
    :   `command` - the task to execute

    Throws:
    :   `RejectedExecutionException` - at discretion of
        `RejectedExecutionHandler`, if the task
        cannot be accepted for execution
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `command` is null
  + ### shutdown

    public void shutdown()

    Initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously submitted
    tasks are executed, but no new tasks will be accepted.
    Invocation has no additional effect if already shut down.

    This method does not wait for previously submitted tasks to
    complete execution. Use [`awaitTermination`](#awaitTermination(long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit))
    to do that.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and
        shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate
        threads that the caller is not permitted to modify
        because it does not hold [`RuntimePermission`](../../lang/RuntimePermission.md "class in java.lang")`("modifyThread")`,
        or the security manager's `checkAccess` method
        denies access.
  + ### shutdownNow

    public [List](../List.md "interface in java.util")<[Runnable](../../lang/Runnable.md "interface in java.lang")> shutdownNow()

    Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks, halts the
    processing of waiting tasks, and returns a list of the tasks
    that were awaiting execution. These tasks are drained (removed)
    from the task queue upon return from this method.

    This method does not wait for actively executing tasks to
    terminate. Use [`awaitTermination`](#awaitTermination(long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)) to
    do that.

    There are no guarantees beyond best-effort attempts to stop
    processing actively executing tasks. This implementation
    interrupts tasks via [`Thread.interrupt()`](../../lang/Thread.md#interrupt()); any task that
    fails to respond to interrupts may never terminate.

    Returns:
    :   list of tasks that never commenced execution

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and
        shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate
        threads that the caller is not permitted to modify
        because it does not hold [`RuntimePermission`](../../lang/RuntimePermission.md "class in java.lang")`("modifyThread")`,
        or the security manager's `checkAccess` method
        denies access.
  + ### isShutdown

    public boolean isShutdown()

    Description copied from interface: `ExecutorService`

    Returns `true` if this executor has been shut down.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this executor has been shut down
  + ### isTerminating

    public boolean isTerminating()

    Returns true if this executor is in the process of terminating
    after [`shutdown()`](#shutdown()) or [`shutdownNow()`](#shutdownNow()) but has not
    completely terminated. This method may be useful for
    debugging. A return of `true` reported a sufficient
    period after shutdown may indicate that submitted tasks have
    ignored or suppressed interruption, causing this executor not
    to properly terminate.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if terminating but not yet terminated
  + ### isTerminated

    public boolean isTerminated()

    Description copied from interface: `ExecutorService`

    Returns `true` if all tasks have completed following shut down.
    Note that `isTerminated` is never `true` unless
    either `shutdown` or `shutdownNow` was called first.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if all tasks have completed following shut down
  + ### awaitTermination

    public boolean awaitTermination(long timeout,
    [TimeUnit](TimeUnit.md "enum class in java.util.concurrent") unit)
    throws [InterruptedException](../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang")

    Description copied from interface: `ExecutorService`

    Blocks until all tasks have completed execution after a shutdown
    request, or the timeout occurs, or the current thread is
    interrupted, whichever happens first.

    Parameters:
    :   `timeout` - the maximum time to wait
    :   `unit` - the time unit of the timeout argument

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this executor terminated and
        `false` if the timeout elapsed before termination

    Throws:
    :   `InterruptedException` - if interrupted while waiting
  + ### finalize

    [@Deprecated](../../lang/Deprecated.md "annotation interface in java.lang")([since](../../lang/Deprecated.md#since())="9",
    [forRemoval](../../lang/Deprecated.md#forRemoval())=true)
    protected void finalize()

    Deprecated, for removal: This API element is subject to removal in a future version.

    Finalization has been deprecated for removal. See
    [`Object.finalize()`](../../lang/Object.md#finalize()) for background information and details
    about migration options.

    Description copied from class: `Object`

    Called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection
    determines that there are no more references to the object.
    A subclass overrides the `finalize` method to dispose of
    system resources or to perform other cleanup.

    **When running in a Java virtual machine in which finalization has been
    disabled or removed, the garbage collector will never call
    `finalize()`. In a Java virtual machine in which finalization is
    enabled, the garbage collector might call `finalize` only after an
    indefinite delay.**

    The general contract of `finalize` is that it is invoked
    if and when the Java virtual
    machine has determined that there is no longer any
    means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
    not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the
    finalization of some other object or class which is ready to be
    finalized. The `finalize` method may take any action, including
    making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
    of `finalize`, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
    the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
    for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
    explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
    permanently discarded.

    The `finalize` method of class `Object` performs no
    special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
    `Object` may override this definition.

    The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
    invoke the `finalize` method for any given object. It is
    guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
    be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
    invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
    the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.

    After the `finalize` method has been invoked for an object, no
    further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
    determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
    be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
    actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
    at which point the object may be discarded.

    The `finalize` method is never invoked more than once by a Java
    virtual machine for any given object.

    Any exception thrown by the `finalize` method causes
    the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
    ignored.

    Overrides:
    :   `finalize` in class `Object`

  + ### setThreadFactory

    public void setThreadFactory([ThreadFactory](ThreadFactory.md "interface in java.util.concurrent") threadFactory)

    Sets the thread factory used to create new threads.

    Parameters:
    :   `threadFactory` - the new thread factory

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if threadFactory is null

    See Also:
    :   - [`getThreadFactory()`](#getThreadFactory())
  + ### getThreadFactory

    public [ThreadFactory](ThreadFactory.md "interface in java.util.concurrent") getThreadFactory()

    Returns the thread factory used to create new threads.

    Returns:
    :   the current thread factory

    See Also:
    :   - [`setThreadFactory(ThreadFactory)`](#setThreadFactory(java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory))
  + ### setRejectedExecutionHandler

    public void setRejectedExecutionHandler([RejectedExecutionHandler](RejectedExecutionHandler.md "interface in java.util.concurrent") handler)

    Sets a new handler for unexecutable tasks.

    Parameters:
    :   `handler` - the new handler

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if handler is null

    See Also:
    :   - [`getRejectedExecutionHandler()`](#getRejectedExecutionHandler())
  + ### getRejectedExecutionHandler

    public [RejectedExecutionHandler](RejectedExecutionHandler.md "interface in java.util.concurrent") getRejectedExecutionHandler()

    Returns the current handler for unexecutable tasks.

    Returns:
    :   the current handler

    See Also:
    :   - [`setRejectedExecutionHandler(RejectedExecutionHandler)`](#setRejectedExecutionHandler(java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionHandler))
  + ### setCorePoolSize

    public void setCorePoolSize(int corePoolSize)

    Sets the core number of threads. This overrides any value set
    in the constructor. If the new value is smaller than the
    current value, excess existing threads will be terminated when
    they next become idle. If larger, new threads will, if needed,
    be started to execute any queued tasks.

    Parameters:
    :   `corePoolSize` - the new core size

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `corePoolSize < 0`
        or `corePoolSize` is greater than the [maximum pool size](#getMaximumPoolSize())

    See Also:
    :   - [`getCorePoolSize()`](#getCorePoolSize())
  + ### getCorePoolSize

    public int getCorePoolSize()

    Returns the core number of threads.

    Returns:
    :   the core number of threads

    See Also:
    :   - [`setCorePoolSize(int)`](#setCorePoolSize(int))
  + ### prestartCoreThread

    public boolean prestartCoreThread()

    Starts a core thread, causing it to idly wait for work. This
    overrides the default policy of starting core threads only when
    new tasks are executed. This method will return `false`
    if all core threads have already been started.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if a thread was started
  + ### prestartAllCoreThreads

    public int prestartAllCoreThreads()

    Starts all core threads, causing them to idly wait for work. This
    overrides the default policy of starting core threads only when
    new tasks are executed.

    Returns:
    :   the number of threads started
  + ### allowsCoreThreadTimeOut

    public boolean allowsCoreThreadTimeOut()

    Returns true if this pool allows core threads to time out and
    terminate if no tasks arrive within the keepAlive time, being
    replaced if needed when new tasks arrive. When true, the same
    keep-alive policy applying to non-core threads applies also to
    core threads. When false (the default), core threads are never
    terminated due to lack of incoming tasks.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if core threads are allowed to time out,
        else `false`

    Since:
    :   1.6
  + ### allowCoreThreadTimeOut

    public void allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean value)

    Sets the policy governing whether core threads may time out and
    terminate if no tasks arrive within the keep-alive time, being
    replaced if needed when new tasks arrive. When false, core
    threads are never terminated due to lack of incoming
    tasks. When true, the same keep-alive policy applying to
    non-core threads applies also to core threads. To avoid
    continual thread replacement, the keep-alive time must be
    greater than zero when setting `true`. This method
    should in general be called before the pool is actively used.

    Parameters:
    :   `value` - `true` if should time out, else `false`

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if value is `true`
        and the current keep-alive time is not greater than zero

    Since:
    :   1.6
  + ### setMaximumPoolSize

    public void setMaximumPoolSize(int maximumPoolSize)

    Sets the maximum allowed number of threads. This overrides any
    value set in the constructor. If the new value is smaller than
    the current value, excess existing threads will be
    terminated when they next become idle.

    Parameters:
    :   `maximumPoolSize` - the new maximum

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the new maximum is
        less than or equal to zero, or
        less than the [core pool size](#getCorePoolSize())

    See Also:
    :   - [`getMaximumPoolSize()`](#getMaximumPoolSize())
  + ### getMaximumPoolSize

    public int getMaximumPoolSize()

    Returns the maximum allowed number of threads.

    Returns:
    :   the maximum allowed number of threads

    See Also:
    :   - [`setMaximumPoolSize(int)`](#setMaximumPoolSize(int))
  + ### setKeepAliveTime

    public void setKeepAliveTime(long time,
    [TimeUnit](TimeUnit.md "enum class in java.util.concurrent") unit)

    Sets the thread keep-alive time, which is the amount of time
    that threads may remain idle before being terminated.
    Threads that wait this amount of time without processing a
    task will be terminated if there are more than the core
    number of threads currently in the pool, or if this pool
    [allows core thread timeout](#allowsCoreThreadTimeOut()).
    This overrides any value set in the constructor.

    Parameters:
    :   `time` - the time to wait. A time value of zero will cause
        excess threads to terminate immediately after executing tasks.
    :   `unit` - the time unit of the `time` argument

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `time` less than zero or
        if `time` is zero and `allowsCoreThreadTimeOut`

    See Also:
    :   - [`getKeepAliveTime(TimeUnit)`](#getKeepAliveTime(java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit))
  + ### getKeepAliveTime

    public long getKeepAliveTime([TimeUnit](TimeUnit.md "enum class in java.util.concurrent") unit)

    Returns the thread keep-alive time, which is the amount of time
    that threads may remain idle before being terminated.
    Threads that wait this amount of time without processing a
    task will be terminated if there are more than the core
    number of threads currently in the pool, or if this pool
    [allows core thread timeout](#allowsCoreThreadTimeOut()).

    Parameters:
    :   `unit` - the desired time unit of the result

    Returns:
    :   the time limit

    See Also:
    :   - [`setKeepAliveTime(long, TimeUnit)`](#setKeepAliveTime(long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit))
  + ### getQueue

    public [BlockingQueue](BlockingQueue.md "interface in java.util.concurrent")<[Runnable](../../lang/Runnable.md "interface in java.lang")> getQueue()

    Returns the task queue used by this executor. Access to the
    task queue is intended primarily for debugging and monitoring.
    This queue may be in active use. Retrieving the task queue
    does not prevent queued tasks from executing.

    Returns:
    :   the task queue
  + ### remove

    public boolean remove([Runnable](../../lang/Runnable.md "interface in java.lang") task)

    Removes this task from the executor's internal queue if it is
    present, thus causing it not to be run if it has not already
    started.

    This method may be useful as one part of a cancellation
    scheme. It may fail to remove tasks that have been converted
    into other forms before being placed on the internal queue.
    For example, a task entered using `submit` might be
    converted into a form that maintains `Future` status.
    However, in such cases, method [`purge()`](#purge()) may be used to
    remove those Futures that have been cancelled.

    Parameters:
    :   `task` - the task to remove

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the task was removed
  + ### purge

    public void purge()

    Tries to remove from the work queue all [`Future`](Future.md "interface in java.util.concurrent")
    tasks that have been cancelled. This method can be useful as a
    storage reclamation operation, that has no other impact on
    functionality. Cancelled tasks are never executed, but may
    accumulate in work queues until worker threads can actively
    remove them. Invoking this method instead tries to remove them now.
    However, this method may fail to remove tasks in
    the presence of interference by other threads.
  + ### getPoolSize

    public int getPoolSize()

    Returns the current number of threads in the pool.

    Returns:
    :   the number of threads
  + ### getActiveCount

    public int getActiveCount()

    Returns the approximate number of threads that are actively
    executing tasks.

    Returns:
    :   the number of threads
  + ### getLargestPoolSize

    public int getLargestPoolSize()

    Returns the largest number of threads that have ever
    simultaneously been in the pool.

    Returns:
    :   the number of threads
  + ### getTaskCount

    public long getTaskCount()

    Returns the approximate total number of tasks that have ever been
    scheduled for execution. Because the states of tasks and
    threads may change dynamically during computation, the returned
    value is only an approximation.

    Returns:
    :   the number of tasks
  + ### getCompletedTaskCount

    public long getCompletedTaskCount()

    Returns the approximate total number of tasks that have
    completed execution. Because the states of tasks and threads
    may change dynamically during computation, the returned value
    is only an approximation, but one that does not ever decrease
    across successive calls.

    Returns:
    :   the number of tasks
  + ### toString

    public [String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Returns a string identifying this pool, as well as its state,
    including indications of run state and estimated worker and
    task counts.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a string identifying this pool, as well as its state
  + ### beforeExecute

    protected void beforeExecute([Thread](../../lang/Thread.md "class in java.lang") t,
    [Runnable](../../lang/Runnable.md "interface in java.lang") r)

    Method invoked prior to executing the given Runnable in the
    given thread. This method is invoked by thread `t` that
    will execute task `r`, and may be used to re-initialize
    ThreadLocals, or to perform logging.

    This implementation does nothing, but may be customized in
    subclasses. Note: To properly nest multiple overridings, subclasses
    should generally invoke `super.beforeExecute` at the end of
    this method.

    Parameters:
    :   `t` - the thread that will run task `r`
    :   `r` - the task that will be executed
  + ### afterExecute

    protected void afterExecute([Runnable](../../lang/Runnable.md "interface in java.lang") r,
    [Throwable](../../lang/Throwable.md "class in java.lang") t)

    Method invoked upon completion of execution of the given Runnable.
    This method is invoked by the thread that executed the task. If
    non-null, the Throwable is the uncaught `RuntimeException`
    or `Error` that caused execution to terminate abruptly.

    This implementation does nothing, but may be customized in
    subclasses. Note: To properly nest multiple overridings, subclasses
    should generally invoke `super.afterExecute` at the
    beginning of this method.

    **Note:** When actions are enclosed in tasks (such as
    [`FutureTask`](FutureTask.md "class in java.util.concurrent")) either explicitly or via methods such as
    `submit`, these task objects catch and maintain
    computational exceptions, and so they do not cause abrupt
    termination, and the internal exceptions are *not*
    passed to this method. If you would like to trap both kinds of
    failures in this method, you can further probe for such cases,
    as in this sample subclass that prints either the direct cause
    or the underlying exception if a task has been aborted:

    ```
     class ExtendedExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor {
       // ...
       protected void afterExecute(Runnable r, Throwable t) {
         super.afterExecute(r, t);
         if (t == null
             && r instanceof Future<?>
             && ((Future<?>)r).isDone()) {
           try {
             Object result = ((Future<?>) r).get();
           } catch (CancellationException ce) {
             t = ce;
           } catch (ExecutionException ee) {
             t = ee.getCause();
           } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
             // ignore/reset
             Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
           }
         }
         if (t != null)
           System.out.println(t);
       }
     }
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `r` - the runnable that has completed
    :   `t` - the exception that caused termination, or null if
        execution completed normally
  + ### terminated

    protected void terminated()

    Method invoked when the Executor has terminated. Default
    implementation does nothing. Note: To properly nest multiple
    overridings, subclasses should generally invoke
    `super.terminated` within this method.
