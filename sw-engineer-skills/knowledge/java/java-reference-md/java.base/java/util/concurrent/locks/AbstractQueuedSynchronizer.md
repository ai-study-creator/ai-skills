public abstract class AbstractQueuedSynchronizer
extends [AbstractOwnableSynchronizer](AbstractOwnableSynchronizer.md "class in java.util.concurrent.locks")
implements [Serializable](../../../io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io")

Provides a framework for implementing blocking locks and related
synchronizers (semaphores, events, etc) that rely on
first-in-first-out (FIFO) wait queues. This class is designed to
be a useful basis for most kinds of synchronizers that rely on a
single atomic `int` value to represent state. Subclasses
must define the protected methods that change this state, and which
define what that state means in terms of this object being acquired
or released. Given these, the other methods in this class carry
out all queuing and blocking mechanics. Subclasses can maintain
other state fields, but only the atomically updated `int`
value manipulated using methods [`getState()`](#getState()), [`setState(int)`](#setState(int)) and [`compareAndSetState(int, int)`](#compareAndSetState(int,int)) is tracked with respect
to synchronization.

Subclasses should be defined as non-public internal helper
classes that are used to implement the synchronization properties
of their enclosing class. Class
`AbstractQueuedSynchronizer` does not implement any
synchronization interface. Instead it defines methods such as
[`acquireInterruptibly(int)`](#acquireInterruptibly(int)) that can be invoked as
appropriate by concrete locks and related synchronizers to
implement their public methods.

This class supports either or both a default *exclusive*
mode and a *shared* mode. When acquired in exclusive mode,
attempted acquires by other threads cannot succeed. Shared mode
acquires by multiple threads may (but need not) succeed. This class
does not "understand" these differences except in the
mechanical sense that when a shared mode acquire succeeds, the next
waiting thread (if one exists) must also determine whether it can
acquire as well. Threads waiting in the different modes share the
same FIFO queue. Usually, implementation subclasses support only
one of these modes, but both can come into play for example in a
[`ReadWriteLock`](ReadWriteLock.md "interface in java.util.concurrent.locks"). Subclasses that support only exclusive or
only shared modes need not define the methods supporting the unused mode.

This class defines a nested [`AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject`](AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject.md "class in java.util.concurrent.locks") class that
can be used as a [`Condition`](Condition.md "interface in java.util.concurrent.locks") implementation by subclasses
supporting exclusive mode for which method [`isHeldExclusively()`](#isHeldExclusively()) reports whether synchronization is exclusively
held with respect to the current thread, method [`release(int)`](#release(int))
invoked with the current [`getState()`](#getState()) value fully releases
this object, and `acquire(java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.Node, int, boolean, boolean, boolean, long)`, given this saved state value,
eventually restores this object to its previous acquired state. No
`AbstractQueuedSynchronizer` method otherwise creates such a
condition, so if this constraint cannot be met, do not use it. The
behavior of [`AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject`](AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject.md "class in java.util.concurrent.locks") depends of course on the
semantics of its synchronizer implementation.

This class provides inspection, instrumentation, and monitoring
methods for the internal queue, as well as similar methods for
condition objects. These can be exported as desired into classes
using an `AbstractQueuedSynchronizer` for their
synchronization mechanics.

Serialization of this class stores only the underlying atomic
integer maintaining state, so deserialized objects have empty
thread queues. Typical subclasses requiring serializability will
define a `readObject` method that restores this to a known
initial state upon deserialization.

## Usage

To use this class as the basis of a synchronizer, redefine the
following methods, as applicable, by inspecting and/or modifying
the synchronization state using [`getState()`](#getState()), [`setState(int)`](#setState(int)) and/or [`compareAndSetState(int, int)`](#compareAndSetState(int,int)):

* [`tryAcquire(int)`](#tryAcquire(int))* [`tryRelease(int)`](#tryRelease(int))* [`tryAcquireShared(int)`](#tryAcquireShared(int))* [`tryReleaseShared(int)`](#tryReleaseShared(int))* [`isHeldExclusively()`](#isHeldExclusively())

Each of these methods by default throws [`UnsupportedOperationException`](../../../lang/UnsupportedOperationException.md "class in java.lang"). Implementations of these methods
must be internally thread-safe, and should in general be short and
not block. Defining these methods is the *only* supported
means of using this class. All other methods are declared
`final` because they cannot be independently varied.

You may also find the inherited methods from [`AbstractOwnableSynchronizer`](AbstractOwnableSynchronizer.md "class in java.util.concurrent.locks") useful to keep track of the thread
owning an exclusive synchronizer. You are encouraged to use them
-- this enables monitoring and diagnostic tools to assist users in
determining which threads hold locks.

Even though this class is based on an internal FIFO queue, it
does not automatically enforce FIFO acquisition policies. The core
of exclusive synchronization takes the form:

```
 Acquire:
     while (!tryAcquire(arg)) {
        enqueue thread if it is not already queued;
        possibly block current thread;
     }

 Release:
     if (tryRelease(arg))
        unblock the first queued thread;
```

(Shared mode is similar but may involve cascading signals.)

Because checks in acquire are invoked before
enqueuing, a newly acquiring thread may *barge* ahead of
others that are blocked and queued. However, you can, if desired,
define `tryAcquire` and/or `tryAcquireShared` to
disable barging by internally invoking one or more of the inspection
methods, thereby providing a *fair* FIFO acquisition order.
In particular, most fair synchronizers can define `tryAcquire`
to return `false` if [`hasQueuedPredecessors()`](#hasQueuedPredecessors()) (a method
specifically designed to be used by fair synchronizers) returns
`true`. Other variations are possible.

Throughput and scalability are generally highest for the
default barging (also known as *greedy*,
*renouncement*, and *convoy-avoidance*) strategy.
While this is not guaranteed to be fair or starvation-free, earlier
queued threads are allowed to recontend before later queued
threads, and each recontention has an unbiased chance to succeed
against incoming threads. Also, while acquires do not
"spin" in the usual sense, they may perform multiple
invocations of `tryAcquire` interspersed with other
computations before blocking. This gives most of the benefits of
spins when exclusive synchronization is only briefly held, without
most of the liabilities when it isn't. If so desired, you can
augment this by preceding calls to acquire methods with
"fast-path" checks, possibly prechecking [`hasContended()`](#hasContended())
and/or [`hasQueuedThreads()`](#hasQueuedThreads()) to only do so if the synchronizer
is likely not to be contended.

This class provides an efficient and scalable basis for
synchronization in part by specializing its range of use to
synchronizers that can rely on `int` state, acquire, and
release parameters, and an internal FIFO wait queue. When this does
not suffice, you can build synchronizers from a lower level using
[`atomic`](../atomic/package-summary.md) classes, your own custom
[`Queue`](../../Queue.md "interface in java.util") classes, and [`LockSupport`](LockSupport.md "class in java.util.concurrent.locks") blocking
support.

## Usage Examples

Here is a non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock class that uses
the value zero to represent the unlocked state, and one to
represent the locked state. While a non-reentrant lock
does not strictly require recording of the current owner
thread, this class does so anyway to make usage easier to monitor.
It also supports conditions and exposes some instrumentation methods:

```
 class Mutex implements Lock, java.io.Serializable {

   // Our internal helper class
   private static class Sync extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer {
     // Acquires the lock if state is zero
     public boolean tryAcquire(int acquires) {
       assert acquires == 1; // Otherwise unused
       if (compareAndSetState(0, 1)) {
         setExclusiveOwnerThread(Thread.currentThread());
         return true;
       }
       return false;
     }

     // Releases the lock by setting state to zero
     protected boolean tryRelease(int releases) {
       assert releases == 1; // Otherwise unused
       if (!isHeldExclusively())
         throw new IllegalMonitorStateException();
       setExclusiveOwnerThread(null);
       setState(0);
       return true;
     }

     // Reports whether in locked state
     public boolean isLocked() {
       return getState() != 0;
     }

     public boolean isHeldExclusively() {
       // a data race, but safe due to out-of-thin-air guarantees
       return getExclusiveOwnerThread() == Thread.currentThread();
     }

     // Provides a Condition
     public Condition newCondition() {
       return new ConditionObject();
     }

     // Deserializes properly
     private void readObject(ObjectInputStream s)
         throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
       s.defaultReadObject();
       setState(0); // reset to unlocked state
     }
   }

   // The sync object does all the hard work. We just forward to it.
   private final Sync sync = new Sync();

   public void lock()              { sync.acquire(1); }
   public boolean tryLock()        { return sync.tryAcquire(1); }
   public void unlock()            { sync.release(1); }
   public Condition newCondition() { return sync.newCondition(); }
   public boolean isLocked()       { return sync.isLocked(); }
   public boolean isHeldByCurrentThread() {
     return sync.isHeldExclusively();
   }
   public boolean hasQueuedThreads() {
     return sync.hasQueuedThreads();
   }
   public void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException {
     sync.acquireInterruptibly(1);
   }
   public boolean tryLock(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
       throws InterruptedException {
     return sync.tryAcquireNanos(1, unit.toNanos(timeout));
   }
 }
```

Here is a latch class that is like a
[`CountDownLatch`](../CountDownLatch.md "class in java.util.concurrent")
except that it only requires a single `signal` to
fire. Because a latch is non-exclusive, it uses the `shared`
acquire and release methods.

```
 class BooleanLatch {

   private static class Sync extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer {
     boolean isSignalled() { return getState() != 0; }

     protected int tryAcquireShared(int ignore) {
       return isSignalled() ? 1 : -1;
     }

     protected boolean tryReleaseShared(int ignore) {
       setState(1);
       return true;
     }
   }

   private final Sync sync = new Sync();
   public boolean isSignalled() { return sync.isSignalled(); }
   public void signal()         { sync.releaseShared(1); }
   public void await() throws InterruptedException {
     sync.acquireSharedInterruptibly(1);
   }
 }
```

  + ### getState

    protected final int getState()

    Returns the current value of synchronization state.
    This operation has memory semantics of a `volatile` read.

    Returns:
    :   current state value
  + ### setState

    protected final void setState(int newState)

    Sets the value of synchronization state.
    This operation has memory semantics of a `volatile` write.

    Parameters:
    :   `newState` - the new state value
  + ### compareAndSetState

    protected final boolean compareAndSetState(int expect,
    int update)

    Atomically sets synchronization state to the given updated
    value if the current state value equals the expected value.
    This operation has memory semantics of a `volatile` read
    and write.

    Parameters:
    :   `expect` - the expected value
    :   `update` - the new value

    Returns:
    :   `true` if successful. False return indicates that the actual
        value was not equal to the expected value.
  + ### tryAcquire

    protected boolean tryAcquire(int arg)

    Attempts to acquire in exclusive mode. This method should query
    if the state of the object permits it to be acquired in the
    exclusive mode, and if so to acquire it.

    This method is always invoked by the thread performing
    acquire. If this method reports failure, the acquire method
    may queue the thread, if it is not already queued, until it is
    signalled by a release from some other thread. This can be used
    to implement method [`Lock.tryLock()`](Lock.md#tryLock()).

    The default
    implementation throws [`UnsupportedOperationException`](../../../lang/UnsupportedOperationException.md "class in java.lang").

    Parameters:
    :   `arg` - the acquire argument. This value is always the one
        passed to an acquire method, or is the value saved on entry
        to a condition wait. The value is otherwise uninterpreted
        and can represent anything you like.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if successful. Upon success, this object has
        been acquired.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalMonitorStateException` - if acquiring would place this
        synchronizer in an illegal state. This exception must be
        thrown in a consistent fashion for synchronization to work
        correctly.
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if exclusive mode is not supported
  + ### tryRelease

    protected boolean tryRelease(int arg)

    Attempts to set the state to reflect a release in exclusive
    mode.

    This method is always invoked by the thread performing release.

    The default implementation throws
    [`UnsupportedOperationException`](../../../lang/UnsupportedOperationException.md "class in java.lang").

    Parameters:
    :   `arg` - the release argument. This value is always the one
        passed to a release method, or the current state value upon
        entry to a condition wait. The value is otherwise
        uninterpreted and can represent anything you like.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this object is now in a fully released
        state, so that any waiting threads may attempt to acquire;
        and `false` otherwise.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalMonitorStateException` - if releasing would place this
        synchronizer in an illegal state. This exception must be
        thrown in a consistent fashion for synchronization to work
        correctly.
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if exclusive mode is not supported
  + ### tryAcquireShared

    protected int tryAcquireShared(int arg)

    Attempts to acquire in shared mode. This method should query if
    the state of the object permits it to be acquired in the shared
    mode, and if so to acquire it.

    This method is always invoked by the thread performing
    acquire. If this method reports failure, the acquire method
    may queue the thread, if it is not already queued, until it is
    signalled by a release from some other thread.

    The default implementation throws [`UnsupportedOperationException`](../../../lang/UnsupportedOperationException.md "class in java.lang").

    Parameters:
    :   `arg` - the acquire argument. This value is always the one
        passed to an acquire method, or is the value saved on entry
        to a condition wait. The value is otherwise uninterpreted
        and can represent anything you like.

    Returns:
    :   a negative value on failure; zero if acquisition in shared
        mode succeeded but no subsequent shared-mode acquire can
        succeed; and a positive value if acquisition in shared
        mode succeeded and subsequent shared-mode acquires might
        also succeed, in which case a subsequent waiting thread
        must check availability. (Support for three different
        return values enables this method to be used in contexts
        where acquires only sometimes act exclusively.) Upon
        success, this object has been acquired.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalMonitorStateException` - if acquiring would place this
        synchronizer in an illegal state. This exception must be
        thrown in a consistent fashion for synchronization to work
        correctly.
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if shared mode is not supported
  + ### tryReleaseShared

    protected boolean tryReleaseShared(int arg)

    Attempts to set the state to reflect a release in shared mode.

    This method is always invoked by the thread performing release.

    The default implementation throws
    [`UnsupportedOperationException`](../../../lang/UnsupportedOperationException.md "class in java.lang").

    Parameters:
    :   `arg` - the release argument. This value is always the one
        passed to a release method, or the current state value upon
        entry to a condition wait. The value is otherwise
        uninterpreted and can represent anything you like.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this release of shared mode may permit a
        waiting acquire (shared or exclusive) to succeed; and
        `false` otherwise

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalMonitorStateException` - if releasing would place this
        synchronizer in an illegal state. This exception must be
        thrown in a consistent fashion for synchronization to work
        correctly.
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if shared mode is not supported
  + ### isHeldExclusively

    protected boolean isHeldExclusively()

    Returns `true` if synchronization is held exclusively with
    respect to the current (calling) thread. This method is invoked
    upon each call to a [`AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject`](AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject.md "class in java.util.concurrent.locks") method.

    The default implementation throws [`UnsupportedOperationException`](../../../lang/UnsupportedOperationException.md "class in java.lang"). This method is invoked
    internally only within [`AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject`](AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject.md "class in java.util.concurrent.locks") methods, so need
    not be defined if conditions are not used.

    public final void acquireSharedInterruptibly(int arg)
    throws [InterruptedException](../../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang")

    Acquires in shared mode, aborting if interrupted. Implemented
    by first checking interrupt status, then invoking at least once
    [`tryAcquireShared(int)`](#tryAcquireShared(int)), returning on success. Otherwise the
    thread is queued, possibly repeatedly blocking and unblocking,
    invoking [`tryAcquireShared(int)`](#tryAcquireShared(int)) until success or the thread
    is interrupted.

    Parameters:
    :   `arg` - the acquire argument.
        This value is conveyed to [`tryAcquireShared(int)`](#tryAcquireShared(int)) but is
        otherwise uninterpreted and can represent anything
        you like.

    Throws:
    :   `InterruptedException` - if the current thread is interrupted
  + ### tryAcquireSharedNanos

    public final boolean tryAcquireSharedNanos(int arg,
    long nanosTimeout)
    throws [InterruptedException](../../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang")

    Attempts to acquire in shared mode, aborting if interrupted, and
    failing if the given timeout elapses. Implemented by first
    checking interrupt status, then invoking at least once [`tryAcquireShared(int)`](#tryAcquireShared(int)), returning on success. Otherwise, the
    thread is queued, possibly repeatedly blocking and unblocking,
    invoking [`tryAcquireShared(int)`](#tryAcquireShared(int)) until success or the thread
    is interrupted or the timeout elapses.

    Parameters:
    :   `arg` - the acquire argument. This value is conveyed to
        [`tryAcquireShared(int)`](#tryAcquireShared(int)) but is otherwise uninterpreted
        and can represent anything you like.
    :   `nanosTimeout` - the maximum number of nanoseconds to wait

    Returns:
    :   `true` if acquired; `false` if timed out

    Throws:
    :   `InterruptedException` - if the current thread is interrupted
  + ### releaseShared

    public final boolean releaseShared(int arg)

    Releases in shared mode. Implemented by unblocking one or more
    threads if [`tryReleaseShared(int)`](#tryReleaseShared(int)) returns true.

    Parameters:
    :   `arg` - the release argument. This value is conveyed to
        [`tryReleaseShared(int)`](#tryReleaseShared(int)) but is otherwise uninterpreted
        and can represent anything you like.

    Returns:
    :   the value returned from [`tryReleaseShared(int)`](#tryReleaseShared(int))
  + ### hasQueuedThreads

    public final boolean hasQueuedThreads()

    Queries whether any threads are waiting to acquire. Note that
    because cancellations due to interrupts and timeouts may occur
    at any time, a `true` return does not guarantee that any
    other thread will ever acquire.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if there may be other threads waiting to acquire
  + ### hasContended

    public final boolean hasContended()

    Queries whether any threads have ever contended to acquire this
    synchronizer; that is, if an acquire method has ever blocked.

    In this implementation, this operation returns in
    constant time.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if there has ever been contention
  + ### getFirstQueuedThread

    public final [Thread](../../../lang/Thread.md "class in java.lang") getFirstQueuedThread()

    Returns the first (longest-waiting) thread in the queue, or
    `null` if no threads are currently queued.

    In this implementation, this operation normally returns in
    constant time, but may iterate upon contention if other threads are
    concurrently modifying the queue.

    Returns:
    :   the first (longest-waiting) thread in the queue, or
        `null` if no threads are currently queued
  + ### isQueued

    public final boolean isQueued([Thread](../../../lang/Thread.md "class in java.lang") thread)

    Returns true if the given thread is currently queued.

    This implementation traverses the queue to determine
    presence of the given thread.

    Parameters:
    :   `thread` - the thread

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the given thread is on the queue

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the thread is null
  + ### hasQueuedPredecessors

    public final boolean hasQueuedPredecessors()

    Queries whether any threads have been waiting to acquire longer
    than the current thread.

    An invocation of this method is equivalent to (but may be
    more efficient than):

    ```
     getFirstQueuedThread() != Thread.currentThread()
       && hasQueuedThreads()
    ```

    Note that because cancellations due to interrupts and
    timeouts may occur at any time, a `true` return does not
    guarantee that some other thread will acquire before the current
    thread. Likewise, it is possible for another thread to win a
    race to enqueue after this method has returned `false`,
    due to the queue being empty.

    This method is designed to be used by a fair synchronizer to
    avoid [barging](AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.md#barging).
    Such a synchronizer's [`tryAcquire(int)`](#tryAcquire(int)) method should return
    `false`, and its [`tryAcquireShared(int)`](#tryAcquireShared(int)) method should
    return a negative value, if this method returns `true`
    (unless this is a reentrant acquire). For example, the `tryAcquire` method for a fair, reentrant, exclusive mode
    synchronizer might look like this:

    ```
     protected boolean tryAcquire(int arg) {
       if (isHeldExclusively()) {
         // A reentrant acquire; increment hold count
         return true;
       } else if (hasQueuedPredecessors()) {
         return false;
       } else {
         // try to acquire normally
       }
     }
    ```

    Returns:
    :   `true` if there is a queued thread preceding the
        current thread, and `false` if the current thread
        is at the head of the queue or the queue is empty

    Since:

  + ### getQueueLength

    public final int getQueueLength()

    Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting to
    acquire. The value is only an estimate because the number of
    threads may change dynamically while this method traverses
    internal data structures. This method is designed for use in
    monitoring system state, not for synchronization control.

    Returns:
    :   the estimated number of threads waiting to acquire
  + ### getQueuedThreads

    public final [Collection](../../Collection.md "interface in java.util")<[Thread](../../../lang/Thread.md "class in java.lang")> getQueuedThreads()

    Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to
    acquire. Because the actual set of threads may change
    dynamically while constructing this result, the returned
    collection is only a best-effort estimate. The elements of the
    returned collection are in no particular order. This method is
    designed to facilitate construction of subclasses that provide
    more extensive monitoring facilities.

    Returns:
    :   the collection of threads
  + ### getExclusiveQueuedThreads

    public final [Collection](../../Collection.md "interface in java.util")<[Thread](../../../lang/Thread.md "class in java.lang")> getExclusiveQueuedThreads()

    Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to
    acquire in exclusive mode. This has the same properties
    as [`getQueuedThreads()`](#getQueuedThreads()) except that it only returns
    those threads waiting due to an exclusive acquire.

    Returns:
    :   the collection of threads
  + ### getSharedQueuedThreads

    public final [Collection](../../Collection.md "interface in java.util")<[Thread](../../../lang/Thread.md "class in java.lang")> getSharedQueuedThreads()

    Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to
    acquire in shared mode. This has the same properties
    as [`getQueuedThreads()`](#getQueuedThreads()) except that it only returns
    those threads waiting due to a shared acquire.

    Returns:
    :   the collection of threads
  + ### toString

    public [String](../../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Returns a string identifying this synchronizer, as well as its state.
    The state, in brackets, includes the String `"State ="`
    followed by the current value of [`getState()`](#getState()), and either
    `"nonempty"` or `"empty"` depending on whether the
    queue is empty.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a string identifying this synchronizer, as well as its state
  + ### owns

    public final boolean owns([AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject](AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject.md "class in java.util.concurrent.locks") condition)

    Queries whether the given ConditionObject
    uses this synchronizer as its lock.

    Parameters:
    :   `condition` - the condition

    Returns:
    :   `true` if owned

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the condition is null
  + ### hasWaiters

    public final boolean hasWaiters([AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject](AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject.md "class in java.util.concurrent.locks") condition)

    Queries whether any threads are waiting on the given condition
    associated with this synchronizer. Note that because timeouts
    and interrupts may occur at any time, a `true` return
    does not guarantee that a future `signal` will awaken
    any threads. This method is designed primarily for use in
    monitoring of the system state.

    Parameters:
    :   `condition` - the condition

    Returns:
    :   `true` if there are any waiting threads

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalMonitorStateException` - if exclusive synchronization
        is not held
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the given condition is
        not associated with this synchronizer
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the condition is null
  + ### getWaitQueueLength

    public final int getWaitQueueLength([AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject](AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject.md "class in java.util.concurrent.locks") condition)

    Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting on the
    given condition associated with this synchronizer. Note that
    because timeouts and interrupts may occur at any time, the
    estimate serves only as an upper bound on the actual number of
    waiters. This method is designed for use in monitoring system
    state, not for synchronization control.

    Parameters:
    :   `condition` - the condition

    Returns:
    :   the estimated number of waiting threads

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalMonitorStateException` - if exclusive synchronization
        is not held
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the given condition is
        not associated with this synchronizer
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the condition is null
  + ### getWaitingThreads

    public final [Collection](../../Collection.md "interface in java.util")<[Thread](../../../lang/Thread.md "class in java.lang")> getWaitingThreads([AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject](AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject.md "class in java.util.concurrent.locks") condition)

    Returns a collection containing those threads that may be
    waiting on the given condition associated with this
    synchronizer. Because the actual set of threads may change
    dynamically while constructing this result, the returned
    collection is only a best-effort estimate. The elements of the
    returned collection are in no particular order.

    Parameters:
    :   `condition` - the condition

    Returns:
    :   the collection of threads

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalMonitorStateException` - if exclusive synchronization
        is not held
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the given condition is
        not associated with this synchronizer
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the condition is null
