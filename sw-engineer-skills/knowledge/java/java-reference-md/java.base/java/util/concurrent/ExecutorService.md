public interface ExecutorService
extends [Executor](Executor.md "interface in java.util.concurrent"), [AutoCloseable](../../lang/AutoCloseable.md "interface in java.lang")

An [`Executor`](Executor.md "interface in java.util.concurrent") that provides methods to manage termination and
methods that can produce a [`Future`](Future.md "interface in java.util.concurrent") for tracking progress of
one or more asynchronous tasks.

An `ExecutorService` can be shut down, which will cause
it to reject new tasks. Two different methods are provided for
shutting down an `ExecutorService`. The [`shutdown()`](#shutdown())
method will allow previously submitted tasks to execute before
terminating, while the [`shutdownNow()`](#shutdownNow()) method prevents waiting
tasks from starting and attempts to stop currently executing tasks.
Upon termination, an executor has no tasks actively executing, no
tasks awaiting execution, and no new tasks can be submitted. An
unused `ExecutorService` should be shut down to allow
reclamation of its resources.

Method `submit` extends base method [`Executor.execute(Runnable)`](Executor.md#execute(java.lang.Runnable)) by creating and returning a [`Future`](Future.md "interface in java.util.concurrent")
that can be used to cancel execution and/or wait for completion.
Methods `invokeAny` and `invokeAll` perform the most
commonly useful forms of bulk execution, executing a collection of
tasks and then waiting for at least one, or all, to
complete. (Class [`ExecutorCompletionService`](ExecutorCompletionService.md "class in java.util.concurrent") can be used to
write customized variants of these methods.)

The [`Executors`](Executors.md "class in java.util.concurrent") class provides factory methods for the
executor services provided in this package.

## Usage Examples

Here is a sketch of a network service in which threads in a thread
pool service incoming requests. It uses the preconfigured [`Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int)`](Executors.md#newFixedThreadPool(int)) factory method:

```
 class NetworkService implements Runnable {
   private final ServerSocket serverSocket;
   private final ExecutorService pool;

   public NetworkService(int port, int poolSize)
       throws IOException {
     serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
     pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(poolSize);
   }

   public void run() { // run the service
     try {
       for (;;) {
         pool.execute(new Handler(serverSocket.accept()));
       }
     } catch (IOException ex) {
       pool.shutdown();
     }
   }
 }

 class Handler implements Runnable {
   private final Socket socket;
   Handler(Socket socket) { this.socket = socket; }
   public void run() {
     // read and service request on socket
   }
 }
```

An `ExecutorService` may also be established and closed
(shutdown, blocking until terminated) as follows; illustrating with
a different `Executors` factory method:

```
 try (ExecutorService e =  Executors.newWorkStealingPool()) {
   // submit or execute many tasks with e ...
 }
```

Further customization is also possible. For example, the following
method shuts down an `ExecutorService` in two phases, first
by calling `shutdown` to reject incoming tasks, and then
calling `shutdownNow`, if necessary, to cancel any lingering
tasks:

```
 void shutdownAndAwaitTermination(ExecutorService pool) {
   pool.shutdown(); // Disable new tasks from being submitted
   try {
     // Wait a while for existing tasks to terminate
     if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
       pool.shutdownNow(); // Cancel currently executing tasks
       // Wait a while for tasks to respond to being cancelled
       if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS))
           System.err.println("Pool did not terminate");
     }
   } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
     // (Re-)Cancel if current thread also interrupted
     pool.shutdownNow();
     // Preserve interrupt status
     Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
   }
 }
```

Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to the
submission of a `Runnable` or `Callable` task to an
`ExecutorService`
[*happen-before*](package-summary.md#MemoryVisibility)
any actions taken by that task, which in turn *happen-before* the
result is retrieved via `Future.get()`.

  `execute`

* ## Method Details

  + ### shutdown

    void shutdown()

    Initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously submitted
    tasks are executed, but no new tasks will be accepted.
    Invocation has no additional effect if already shut down.

    This method does not wait for previously submitted tasks to
    complete execution. Use [`awaitTermination`](#awaitTermination(long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit))
    to do that.

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and
        shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate
        threads that the caller is not permitted to modify
        because it does not hold [`RuntimePermission`](../../lang/RuntimePermission.md "class in java.lang")`("modifyThread")`,
        or the security manager's `checkAccess` method
        denies access.
  + ### shutdownNow

    [List](../List.md "interface in java.util")<[Runnable](../../lang/Runnable.md "interface in java.lang")> shutdownNow()

    Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks, halts the
    processing of waiting tasks, and returns a list of the tasks
    that were awaiting execution.

    This method does not wait for actively executing tasks to
    terminate. Use [`awaitTermination`](#awaitTermination(long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)) to
    do that.

    There are no guarantees beyond best-effort attempts to stop
    processing actively executing tasks. For example, typical
    implementations will cancel via [`Thread.interrupt()`](../../lang/Thread.md#interrupt()), so any
    task that fails to respond to interrupts may never terminate.

    Returns:
    :   list of tasks that never commenced execution

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and
        shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate
        threads that the caller is not permitted to modify
        because it does not hold [`RuntimePermission`](../../lang/RuntimePermission.md "class in java.lang")`("modifyThread")`,
        or the security manager's `checkAccess` method
        denies access.
  + ### isShutdown

    boolean isShutdown()

    Returns `true` if this executor has been shut down.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this executor has been shut down
  + ### isTerminated

    boolean isTerminated()

    Returns `true` if all tasks have completed following shut down.
    Note that `isTerminated` is never `true` unless
    either `shutdown` or `shutdownNow` was called first.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if all tasks have completed following shut down
  + ### awaitTermination

    boolean awaitTermination(long timeout,
    [TimeUnit](TimeUnit.md "enum class in java.util.concurrent") unit)
    throws [InterruptedException](../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang")

    Blocks until all tasks have completed execution after a shutdown
    request, or the timeout occurs, or the current thread is
    interrupted, whichever happens first.

    Parameters:
    :   `timeout` - the maximum time to wait
    :   `unit` - the time unit of the timeout argument

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this executor terminated and
        `false` if the timeout elapsed before termination

    Throws:
    :   `InterruptedException` - if interrupted while waiting
  + ### submit

    <T> [Future](Future.md "interface in java.util.concurrent")<T> submit([Callable](Callable.md "interface in java.util.concurrent")<T> task)

    Submits a value-returning task for execution and returns a
    Future representing the pending results of the task. The
    Future's `get` method will return the task's result upon
    successful completion.

    If you would like to immediately block waiting
    for a task, you can use constructions of the form
    `result = exec.submit(aCallable).get();`

    Note: The [`Executors`](Executors.md "class in java.util.concurrent") class includes a set of methods
    that can convert some other common closure-like objects,
    for example, [`PrivilegedAction`](../../security/PrivilegedAction.md "interface in java.security") to
    [`Callable`](Callable.md "interface in java.util.concurrent") form so they can be submitted.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the type of the task's result

    Parameters:
    :   `task` - the task to submit

    Returns:
    :   a Future representing pending completion of the task

    Throws:
    :   `RejectedExecutionException` - if the task cannot be
        scheduled for execution
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the task is null
  + ### submit

    <T> [Future](Future.md "interface in java.util.concurrent")<T> submit([Runnable](../../lang/Runnable.md "interface in java.lang") task,
    T result)

    Submits a Runnable task for execution and returns a Future
    representing that task. The Future's `get` method will
    return the given result upon successful completion.

  + ### close

    default void close()

    Initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously submitted tasks are
    executed, but no new tasks will be accepted. This method waits until all
    tasks have completed execution and the executor has terminated.

    If interrupted while waiting, this method stops all executing tasks as
    if by invoking [`shutdownNow()`](#shutdownNow()). It then continues to wait until all
    actively executing tasks have completed. Tasks that were awaiting
    execution are not executed. The interrupt status will be re-asserted
    before this method returns.

    If already terminated, invoking this method has no effect.

    Specified by:
    :   `close` in interface `AutoCloseable`

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and
        shutting down this ExecutorService may manipulate
        threads that the caller is not permitted to modify
        because it does not hold [`RuntimePermission`](../../lang/RuntimePermission.md "class in java.lang")`("modifyThread")`,
        or the security manager's `checkAccess` method
        denies access.
