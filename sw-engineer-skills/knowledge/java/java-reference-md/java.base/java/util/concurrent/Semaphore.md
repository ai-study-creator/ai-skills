public class Semaphore
extends [Object](../../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Serializable](../../io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io")

A counting semaphore. Conceptually, a semaphore maintains a set of
permits. Each [`acquire()`](#acquire()) blocks if necessary until a permit is
available, and then takes it. Each [`release()`](#release()) adds a permit,
potentially releasing a blocking acquirer.
However, no actual permit objects are used; the `Semaphore` just
keeps a count of the number available and acts accordingly.

Semaphores are often used to restrict the number of threads than can
access some (physical or logical) resource. For example, here is
a class that uses a semaphore to control access to a pool of items:

```
 class Pool {
   private static final int MAX_AVAILABLE = 100;
   private final Semaphore available = new Semaphore(MAX_AVAILABLE, true);

   public Object getItem() throws InterruptedException {
     available.acquire();
     return getNextAvailableItem();
   }

   public void putItem(Object x) {
     if (markAsUnused(x))
       available.release();
   }

   // Not a particularly efficient data structure; just for demo

   protected Object[] items = ...; // whatever kinds of items being managed
   protected boolean[] used = new boolean[MAX_AVAILABLE];

   protected synchronized Object getNextAvailableItem() {
     for (int i = 0; i < MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
       if (!used[i]) {
         used[i] = true;
         return items[i];
       }
     }
     return null; // not reached
   }

   protected synchronized boolean markAsUnused(Object item) {
     for (int i = 0; i < MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
       if (item == items[i]) {
         if (used[i]) {
           used[i] = false;
           return true;
         } else
           return false;
       }
     }
     return false;
   }
 }
```

Before obtaining an item each thread must acquire a permit from
the semaphore, guaranteeing that an item is available for use. When
the thread has finished with the item it is returned back to the
pool and a permit is returned to the semaphore, allowing another
thread to acquire that item. Note that no synchronization lock is
held when [`acquire()`](#acquire()) is called as that would prevent an item
from being returned to the pool. The semaphore encapsulates the
synchronization needed to restrict access to the pool, separately
from any synchronization needed to maintain the consistency of the
pool itself.

A semaphore initialized to one, and which is used such that it
only has at most one permit available, can serve as a mutual
exclusion lock. This is more commonly known as a *binary
semaphore*, because it only has two states: one permit
available, or zero permits available. When used in this way, the
binary semaphore has the property (unlike many [`Lock`](locks/Lock.md "interface in java.util.concurrent.locks")
implementations), that the "lock" can be released by a
thread other than the owner (as semaphores have no notion of
ownership). This can be useful in some specialized contexts, such
as deadlock recovery.

The constructor for this class optionally accepts a
*fairness* parameter. When set false, this class makes no
guarantees about the order in which threads acquire permits. In
particular, *barging* is permitted, that is, a thread
invoking [`acquire()`](#acquire()) can be allocated a permit ahead of a
thread that has been waiting - logically the new thread places itself at
the head of the queue of waiting threads. When fairness is set true, the
semaphore guarantees that threads invoking any of the [`acquire`](#acquire()) methods are selected to obtain permits in the order in
which their invocation of those methods was processed
(first-in-first-out; FIFO). Note that FIFO ordering necessarily
applies to specific internal points of execution within these
methods. So, it is possible for one thread to invoke
`acquire` before another, but reach the ordering point after
the other, and similarly upon return from the method.
Also note that the untimed [`tryAcquire`](#tryAcquire()) methods do not
honor the fairness setting, but will take any permits that are
available.

Generally, semaphores used to control resource access should be
initialized as fair, to ensure that no thread is starved out from
accessing a resource. When using semaphores for other kinds of
synchronization control, the throughput advantages of non-fair
ordering often outweigh fairness considerations.

This class also provides convenience methods to [`acquire`](#acquire(int)) and [`release`](#release(int)) multiple
permits at a time. These methods are generally more efficient and
effective than loops. However, they do not establish any preference
order. For example, if thread A invokes `s.acquire(3`) and
thread B invokes `s.acquire(2)`, and two permits become
available, then there is no guarantee that thread B will obtain
them unless its acquire came first and Semaphore `s` is in
fair mode.

Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to calling
a "release" method such as `release()`
[*happen-before*](package-summary.md#MemoryVisibility)
actions following a successful "acquire" method such as `acquire()`
in another thread.

  + ### Semaphore

    public Semaphore(int permits)

    Creates a `Semaphore` with the given number of
    permits and nonfair fairness setting.

    Parameters:
    :   `permits` - the initial number of permits available.
        This value may be negative, in which case releases
        must occur before any acquires will be granted.
  + ### Semaphore

    public Semaphore(int permits,
    boolean fair)

    Creates a `Semaphore` with the given number of
    permits and the given fairness setting.

    Parameters:
    :   `permits` - the initial number of permits available.
        This value may be negative, in which case releases
        must occur before any acquires will be granted.
    :   `fair` - `true` if this semaphore will guarantee
        first-in first-out granting of permits under contention,
        else `false`
* ## Method Details

  + ### acquire

    public void acquire()
    throws [InterruptedException](../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang")

    Acquires a permit from this semaphore, blocking until one is
    available, or the thread is [interrupted](../../lang/Thread.md#interrupt()).

    Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
    reducing the number of available permits by one.

    If no permit is available then the current thread becomes
    disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
    one of two things happens:
    - Some other thread invokes the [`release()`](#release()) method for this
      semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned a permit; or- Some other thread [interrupts](../../lang/Thread.md#interrupt())
        the current thread.

    If the current thread:
    - has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or- is [interrupted](../../lang/Thread.md#interrupt()) while waiting
        for a permit,then [`InterruptedException`](../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang") is thrown and the current thread's
    interrupted status is cleared.

    Throws:
    :   `InterruptedException` - if the current thread is interrupted
  + ### acquireUninterruptibly

    public void acquireUninterruptibly()

    Acquires a permit from this semaphore, blocking until one is
    available.

    Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
    reducing the number of available permits by one.

    If no permit is available then the current thread becomes
    disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
    some other thread invokes the [`release()`](#release()) method for this
    semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned a permit.

    If the current thread is [interrupted](../../lang/Thread.md#interrupt())
    while waiting for a permit then it will continue to wait, but the
    time at which the thread is assigned a permit may change compared to
    the time it would have received the permit had no interruption
    occurred. When the thread does return from this method its interrupt
    status will be set.
  + ### tryAcquire

    public boolean tryAcquire()

    Acquires a permit from this semaphore, only if one is available at the
    time of invocation.

    Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
    with the value `true`,
    reducing the number of available permits by one.

    If no permit is available then this method will return
    immediately with the value `false`.

    Even when this semaphore has been set to use a
    fair ordering policy, a call to `tryAcquire()` *will*
    immediately acquire a permit if one is available, whether or not
    other threads are currently waiting.
    This "barging" behavior can be useful in certain
    circumstances, even though it breaks fairness. If you want to honor
    the fairness setting, then use
    [`tryAcquire(0, TimeUnit.SECONDS)`](#tryAcquire(long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit))
    which is almost equivalent (it also detects interruption).

    Returns:
    :   `true` if a permit was acquired and `false`
        otherwise
  + ### tryAcquire

    public boolean tryAcquire(long timeout,
    [TimeUnit](TimeUnit.md "enum class in java.util.concurrent") unit)
    throws [InterruptedException](../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang")

    Acquires a permit from this semaphore, if one becomes available
    within the given waiting time and the current thread has not
    been [interrupted](../../lang/Thread.md#interrupt()).

    Acquires a permit, if one is available and returns immediately,
    with the value `true`,
    reducing the number of available permits by one.

    If no permit is available then the current thread becomes
    disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
    one of three things happens:
    - Some other thread invokes the [`release()`](#release()) method for this
      semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned a permit; or- Some other thread [interrupts](../../lang/Thread.md#interrupt())
        the current thread; or- The specified waiting time elapses.

    If a permit is acquired then the value `true` is returned.

    If the current thread:
    - has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or- is [interrupted](../../lang/Thread.md#interrupt()) while waiting
        to acquire a permit,then [`InterruptedException`](../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang") is thrown and the current thread's
    interrupted status is cleared.

    If the specified waiting time elapses then the value `false`
    is returned. If the time is less than or equal to zero, the method
    will not wait at all.

    Parameters:
    :   `timeout` - the maximum time to wait for a permit
    :   `unit` - the time unit of the `timeout` argument

    Returns:
    :   `true` if a permit was acquired and `false`
        if the waiting time elapsed before a permit was acquired

    Throws:
    :   `InterruptedException` - if the current thread is interrupted
  + ### release

    public void release()

    Releases a permit, returning it to the semaphore.

    Releases a permit, increasing the number of available permits by
    one. If any threads are trying to acquire a permit, then one is
    selected and given the permit that was just released. That thread
    is (re)enabled for thread scheduling purposes.

    There is no requirement that a thread that releases a permit must
    have acquired that permit by calling [`acquire()`](#acquire()).
    Correct usage of a semaphore is established by programming convention
    in the application.
  + ### acquire

    public void acquire(int permits)
    throws [InterruptedException](../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang")

    Acquires the given number of permits from this semaphore,
    blocking until all are available,
    or the thread is [interrupted](../../lang/Thread.md#interrupt()).

    Acquires the given number of permits, if they are available,
    and returns immediately, reducing the number of available permits
    by the given amount. This method has the same effect as the
    loop `for (int i = 0; i < permits; ++i) acquire();` except
    that it atomically acquires the permits all at once:

    If insufficient permits are available then the current thread becomes
    disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
    one of two things happens:
    - Some other thread invokes one of the [`release`](#release())
      methods for this semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned
      permits and the number of available permits satisfies this request; or- Some other thread [interrupts](../../lang/Thread.md#interrupt())
        the current thread.

    If the current thread:
    - has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or- is [interrupted](../../lang/Thread.md#interrupt()) while waiting
        for a permit,then [`InterruptedException`](../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang") is thrown and the current thread's
    interrupted status is cleared.
    Any permits that were to be assigned to this thread are instead
    assigned to other threads trying to acquire permits, as if
    permits had been made available by a call to [`release()`](#release()).

    Parameters:
    :   `permits` - the number of permits to acquire

    Throws:
    :   `InterruptedException` - if the current thread is interrupted
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `permits` is negative
  + ### acquireUninterruptibly

    public void acquireUninterruptibly(int permits)

    Acquires the given number of permits from this semaphore,
    blocking until all are available.

    Acquires the given number of permits, if they are available,
    and returns immediately, reducing the number of available permits
    by the given amount. This method has the same effect as the
    loop `for (int i = 0; i < permits; ++i) acquireUninterruptibly();`
    except that it atomically acquires the permits all at once:

    If insufficient permits are available then the current thread becomes
    disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
    some other thread invokes one of the [`release`](#release())
    methods for this semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned
    permits and the number of available permits satisfies this request.

    If the current thread is [interrupted](../../lang/Thread.md#interrupt())
    while waiting for permits then it will continue to wait and its
    position in the queue is not affected. When the thread does return
    from this method its interrupt status will be set.

    Parameters:
    :   `permits` - the number of permits to acquire

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `permits` is negative
  + ### tryAcquire

    public boolean tryAcquire(int permits)

    Acquires the given number of permits from this semaphore, only
    if all are available at the time of invocation.

    Acquires the given number of permits, if they are available, and
    returns immediately, with the value `true`,
    reducing the number of available permits by the given amount.

    If insufficient permits are available then this method will return
    immediately with the value `false` and the number of available
    permits is unchanged.

    Even when this semaphore has been set to use a fair ordering
    policy, a call to `tryAcquire` *will*
    immediately acquire a permit if one is available, whether or
    not other threads are currently waiting. This
    "barging" behavior can be useful in certain
    circumstances, even though it breaks fairness. If you want to
    honor the fairness setting, then use [`tryAcquire(permits, 0, TimeUnit.SECONDS)`](#tryAcquire(int,long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit))
    which is almost equivalent (it also detects interruption).

    Parameters:
    :   `permits` - the number of permits to acquire

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the permits were acquired and
        `false` otherwise

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `permits` is negative
  + ### tryAcquire

    public boolean tryAcquire(int permits,
    long timeout,
    [TimeUnit](TimeUnit.md "enum class in java.util.concurrent") unit)
    throws [InterruptedException](../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang")

    Acquires the given number of permits from this semaphore, if all
    become available within the given waiting time and the current
    thread has not been [interrupted](../../lang/Thread.md#interrupt()).

    Acquires the given number of permits, if they are available and
    returns immediately, with the value `true`,
    reducing the number of available permits by the given amount.

    If insufficient permits are available then
    the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling
    purposes and lies dormant until one of three things happens:
    - Some other thread invokes one of the [`release`](#release())
      methods for this semaphore and the current thread is next to be assigned
      permits and the number of available permits satisfies this request; or- Some other thread [interrupts](../../lang/Thread.md#interrupt())
        the current thread; or- The specified waiting time elapses.

    If the permits are acquired then the value `true` is returned.

    If the current thread:
    - has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or- is [interrupted](../../lang/Thread.md#interrupt()) while waiting
        to acquire the permits,then [`InterruptedException`](../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang") is thrown and the current thread's
    interrupted status is cleared.
    Any permits that were to be assigned to this thread, are instead
    assigned to other threads trying to acquire permits, as if
    the permits had been made available by a call to [`release()`](#release()).

    If the specified waiting time elapses then the value `false`
    is returned. If the time is less than or equal to zero, the method
    will not wait at all. Any permits that were to be assigned to this
    thread, are instead assigned to other threads trying to acquire
    permits, as if the permits had been made available by a call to
    [`release()`](#release()).

    Parameters:
    :   `permits` - the number of permits to acquire
    :   `timeout` - the maximum time to wait for the permits
    :   `unit` - the time unit of the `timeout` argument

    Returns:
    :   `true` if all permits were acquired and `false`
        if the waiting time elapsed before all permits were acquired

    Throws:
    :   `InterruptedException` - if the current thread is interrupted
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `permits` is negative
  + ### release

    public void release(int permits)

    Releases the given number of permits, returning them to the semaphore.

    Releases the given number of permits, increasing the number of
    available permits by that amount.
    If any threads are trying to acquire permits, then one thread
    is selected and given the permits that were just released.
    If the number of available permits satisfies that thread's request
    then that thread is (re)enabled for thread scheduling purposes;
    otherwise the thread will wait until sufficient permits are available.
    If there are still permits available
    after this thread's request has been satisfied, then those permits
    are assigned in turn to other threads trying to acquire permits.

    There is no requirement that a thread that releases a permit must
    have acquired that permit by calling [`acquire`](#acquire()).
    Correct usage of a semaphore is established by programming convention
    in the application.

    Parameters:
    :   `permits` - the number of permits to release

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `permits` is negative
  + ### availablePermits

    public int availablePermits()

    Returns the current number of permits available in this semaphore.

    This method is typically used for debugging and testing purposes.

    Returns:
    :   the number of permits available in this semaphore
  + ### drainPermits

    public int drainPermits()

    Acquires and returns all permits that are immediately
    available, or if negative permits are available, releases them.
    Upon return, zero permits are available.

    Returns:
    :   the number of permits acquired or, if negative, the
        number released
  + ### reducePermits

    protected void reducePermits(int reduction)

    Shrinks the number of available permits by the indicated
    reduction. This method can be useful in subclasses that use
    semaphores to track resources that become unavailable. This
    method differs from `acquire` in that it does not block
    waiting for permits to become available.

    Parameters:
    :   `reduction` - the number of permits to remove

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `reduction` is negative
  + ### isFair

    public boolean isFair()

    Returns `true` if this semaphore has fairness set true.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this semaphore has fairness set true
  + ### hasQueuedThreads

    public final boolean hasQueuedThreads()

    Queries whether any threads are waiting to acquire. Note that
    because cancellations may occur at any time, a `true`
    return does not guarantee that any other thread will ever
    acquire. This method is designed primarily for use in
    monitoring of the system state.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if there may be other threads waiting to
        acquire the lock
  + ### getQueueLength

    public final int getQueueLength()

    Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting to acquire.
    The value is only an estimate because the number of threads may
    change dynamically while this method traverses internal data
    structures. This method is designed for use in monitoring
    system state, not for synchronization control.

    Returns:
    :   the estimated number of threads waiting for this lock
  + ### getQueuedThreads

    protected [Collection](../Collection.md "interface in java.util")<[Thread](../../lang/Thread.md "class in java.lang")> getQueuedThreads()

    Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to acquire.
    Because the actual set of threads may change dynamically while
    constructing this result, the returned collection is only a best-effort
    estimate. The elements of the returned collection are in no particular
    order. This method is designed to facilitate construction of
    subclasses that provide more extensive monitoring facilities.

    Returns:
    :   the collection of threads
  + ### toString

    public [String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Returns a string identifying this semaphore, as well as its state.
    The state, in brackets, includes the String `"Permits ="`
    followed by the number of permits.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a string identifying this semaphore, as well as its state
