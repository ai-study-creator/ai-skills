# Class ReentrantReadWriteLock

[java.lang.Object](../../../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock

All Implemented Interfaces:
:   `Serializable`, `ReadWriteLock`

---

public class ReentrantReadWriteLock
extends [Object](../../../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [ReadWriteLock](ReadWriteLock.md "interface in java.util.concurrent.locks"), [Serializable](../../../io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io")

An implementation of [`ReadWriteLock`](ReadWriteLock.md "interface in java.util.concurrent.locks") supporting similar
semantics to [`ReentrantLock`](ReentrantLock.md "class in java.util.concurrent.locks").

This class has the following properties:

* **Acquisition order**

  This class does not impose a reader or writer preference
  ordering for lock access. However, it does support an optional
  *fairness* policy.

  ***Non-fair mode (default)***: When constructed as non-fair (the default), the order of entry to the read and write lock is unspecified, subject to reentrancy constraints. A nonfair lock that is continuously contended may indefinitely postpone one or more reader or writer threads, but will normally have higher throughput than a fair lock. ***Fair mode***: When constructed as fair, threads contend for entry using an approximately arrival-order policy. When the currently held lock is released, either the longest-waiting single writer thread will be assigned the write lock, or if there is a group of reader threads waiting longer than all waiting writer threads, that group will be assigned the read lock. A thread that tries to acquire a fair read lock (non-reentrantly) will block if either the write lock is held, or there is a waiting writer thread. The thread will not acquire the read lock until after the oldest currently waiting writer thread has acquired and released the write lock. Of course, if a waiting writer abandons its wait, leaving one or more reader threads as the longest waiters in the queue with the write lock free, then those readers will be assigned the read lock. A thread that tries to acquire a fair write lock (non-reentrantly) will block unless both the read lock and write lock are free (which implies there are no waiting threads). (Note that the non-blocking [`ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock.tryLock()`](ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock.md#tryLock()) and [`ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock.tryLock()`](ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock.md#tryLock()) methods do not honor this fair setting and will immediately acquire the lock if it is possible, regardless of waiting threads.)

  * **Reentrancy**

    This lock allows both readers and writers to reacquire read or
    write locks in the style of a [`ReentrantLock`](ReentrantLock.md "class in java.util.concurrent.locks"). Non-reentrant
    readers are not allowed until all write locks held by the writing
    thread have been released.

    Additionally, a writer can acquire the read lock, but not
    vice-versa. Among other applications, reentrancy can be useful
    when write locks are held during calls or callbacks to methods that
    perform reads under read locks. If a reader tries to acquire the
    write lock it will never succeed.* **Lock downgrading**

      Reentrancy also allows downgrading from the write lock to a read lock,
      by acquiring the write lock, then the read lock and then releasing the
      write lock. However, upgrading from a read lock to the write lock is
      **not** possible.* **Interruption of lock acquisition**

        The read lock and write lock both support interruption during lock
        acquisition.* **[`Condition`](Condition.md "interface in java.util.concurrent.locks") support**

          The write lock provides a [`Condition`](Condition.md "interface in java.util.concurrent.locks") implementation that
          behaves in the same way, with respect to the write lock, as the
          [`Condition`](Condition.md "interface in java.util.concurrent.locks") implementation provided by
          [`ReentrantLock.newCondition()`](ReentrantLock.md#newCondition()) does for [`ReentrantLock`](ReentrantLock.md "class in java.util.concurrent.locks").
          This [`Condition`](Condition.md "interface in java.util.concurrent.locks") can, of course, only be used with the write lock.

          The read lock does not support a [`Condition`](Condition.md "interface in java.util.concurrent.locks") and
          `readLock().newCondition()` throws
          `UnsupportedOperationException`.* **Instrumentation**

            This class supports methods to determine whether locks
            are held or contended. These methods are designed for monitoring
            system state, not for synchronization control.

Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
its state when serialized.

**Sample usages.** Here is a code sketch showing how to perform
lock downgrading after updating a cache (exception handling is
particularly tricky when handling multiple locks in a non-nested
fashion):

```
 class CachedData {
   Object data;
   boolean cacheValid;
   final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

   void processCachedData() {
     rwl.readLock().lock();
     if (!cacheValid) {
       // Must release read lock before acquiring write lock
       rwl.readLock().unlock();
       rwl.writeLock().lock();
       try {
         // Recheck state because another thread might have
         // acquired write lock and changed state before we did.
         if (!cacheValid) {
           data = ...;
           cacheValid = true;
         }
         // Downgrade by acquiring read lock before releasing write lock
         rwl.readLock().lock();
       } finally {
         rwl.writeLock().unlock(); // Unlock write, still hold read
       }
     }

     try {
       use(data);
     } finally {
       rwl.readLock().unlock();
     }
   }
 }
```

ReentrantReadWriteLocks can be used to improve concurrency in some
uses of some kinds of Collections. This is typically worthwhile
only when the collections are expected to be large, accessed by
more reader threads than writer threads, and entail operations with
overhead that outweighs synchronization overhead. For example, here
is a class using a TreeMap that is expected to be large and
concurrently accessed.

```
 class RWDictionary {
   private final Map<String, Data> m = new TreeMap<>();
   private final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
   private final Lock r = rwl.readLock();
   private final Lock w = rwl.writeLock();

   public Data get(String key) {
     r.lock();
     try { return m.get(key); }
     finally { r.unlock(); }
   }
   public List<String> allKeys() {
     r.lock();
     try { return new ArrayList<>(m.keySet()); }
     finally { r.unlock(); }
   }
   public Data put(String key, Data value) {
     w.lock();
     try { return m.put(key, value); }
     finally { w.unlock(); }
   }
   public void clear() {
     w.lock();
     try { m.clear(); }
     finally { w.unlock(); }
   }
 }
```

## Implementation Notes

    Returns the thread that currently owns the write lock, or
    `null` if not owned. When this method is called by a
    thread that is not the owner, the return value reflects a
    best-effort approximation of current lock status. For example,
    the owner may be momentarily `null` even if there are
    threads trying to acquire the lock but have not yet done so.
    This method is designed to facilitate construction of
    subclasses that provide more extensive lock monitoring
    facilities.

    Returns:

  + ### getReadLockCount

    public int getReadLockCount()

    Queries the number of read locks held for this lock. This
    method is designed for use in monitoring system state, not for
    synchronization control.

    Returns:
    :   the number of read locks held
  + ### isWriteLocked

    public boolean isWriteLocked()

    Queries if the write lock is held by any thread. This method is
    designed for use in monitoring system state, not for
    synchronization control.

    Returns:

        `false` otherwise
  + ### getWriteHoldCount

    public int getWriteHoldCount()

    Queries the number of reentrant write holds on this lock by the
    current thread. A writer thread has a hold on a lock for
    each lock action that is not matched by an unlock action.

    Returns:
    :   the number of holds on the write lock by the current thread,
        or zero if the write lock is not held by the current thread
  + ### getReadHoldCount

    public int getReadHoldCount()

    Queries the number of reentrant read holds on this lock by the
    current thread. A reader thread has a hold on a lock for
    each lock action that is not matched by an unlock action.

    Returns:
    :   the number of holds on the read lock by the current thread,
        or zero if the read lock is not held by the current thread

  + ### getQueuedWriterThreads

    protected [Collection](../../Collection.md "interface in java.util")<[Thread](../../../lang/Thread.md "class in java.lang")> getQueuedWriterThreads()

    Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to
    acquire the write lock. Because the actual set of threads may
    change dynamically while constructing this result, the returned
    collection is only a best-effort estimate. The elements of the
    returned collection are in no particular order. This method is
    designed to facilitate construction of subclasses that provide
    more extensive lock monitoring facilities.

    Returns:
    :   the collection of threads
  + ### getQueuedReaderThreads

    protected [Collection](../../Collection.md "interface in java.util")<[Thread](../../../lang/Thread.md "class in java.lang")> getQueuedReaderThreads()

    Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to
    acquire the read lock. Because the actual set of threads may
    change dynamically while constructing this result, the returned
    collection is only a best-effort estimate. The elements of the
    returned collection are in no particular order. This method is
    designed to facilitate construction of subclasses that provide
    more extensive lock monitoring facilities.

    Returns:
    :   the collection of threads
  + ### hasQueuedThreads

    public final boolean hasQueuedThreads()

    Queries whether any threads are waiting to acquire the read or
    write lock. Note that because cancellations may occur at any
    time, a `true` return does not guarantee that any other
    thread will ever acquire a lock. This method is designed
    primarily for use in monitoring of the system state.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if there may be other threads waiting to
        acquire the lock
  + ### hasQueuedThread

    public final boolean hasQueuedThread([Thread](../../../lang/Thread.md "class in java.lang") thread)

    Queries whether the given thread is waiting to acquire either
    the read or write lock. Note that because cancellations may
    occur at any time, a `true` return does not guarantee
    that this thread will ever acquire a lock. This method is
    designed primarily for use in monitoring of the system state.

    Parameters:
    :   `thread` - the thread

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the given thread is queued waiting for this lock

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the thread is null
  + ### getQueueLength

    public final int getQueueLength()

    Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting to acquire
    either the read or write lock. The value is only an estimate
    because the number of threads may change dynamically while this
    method traverses internal data structures. This method is
    designed for use in monitoring system state, not for
    synchronization control.

    Returns:
    :   the estimated number of threads waiting for this lock
  + ### getQueuedThreads

    protected [Collection](../../Collection.md "interface in java.util")<[Thread](../../../lang/Thread.md "class in java.lang")> getQueuedThreads()

    Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to
    acquire either the read or write lock. Because the actual set
    of threads may change dynamically while constructing this
    result, the returned collection is only a best-effort estimate.
    The elements of the returned collection are in no particular
    order. This method is designed to facilitate construction of
    subclasses that provide more extensive monitoring facilities.

    Returns:
    :   the collection of threads
  + ### hasWaiters

    public boolean hasWaiters([Condition](Condition.md "interface in java.util.concurrent.locks") condition)

    Queries whether any threads are waiting on the given condition
    associated with the write lock. Note that because timeouts and
    interrupts may occur at any time, a `true` return does
    not guarantee that a future `signal` will awaken any
    threads. This method is designed primarily for use in
    monitoring of the system state.

    Parameters:
    :   `condition` - the condition

    Returns:
    :   `true` if there are any waiting threads

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalMonitorStateException` - if this lock is not held
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the given condition is
        not associated with this lock
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the condition is null
  + ### getWaitQueueLength

    public int getWaitQueueLength([Condition](Condition.md "interface in java.util.concurrent.locks") condition)

    Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting on the
    given condition associated with the write lock. Note that because
    timeouts and interrupts may occur at any time, the estimate
    serves only as an upper bound on the actual number of waiters.
    This method is designed for use in monitoring of the system
    state, not for synchronization control.

    Parameters:
    :   `condition` - the condition

    Returns:
    :   the estimated number of waiting threads

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalMonitorStateException` - if this lock is not held
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the given condition is
        not associated with this lock
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the condition is null
  + ### getWaitingThreads

    protected [Collection](../../Collection.md "interface in java.util")<[Thread](../../../lang/Thread.md "class in java.lang")> getWaitingThreads([Condition](Condition.md "interface in java.util.concurrent.locks") condition)

    Returns a collection containing those threads that may be
    waiting on the given condition associated with the write lock.
    Because the actual set of threads may change dynamically while
    constructing this result, the returned collection is only a
    best-effort estimate. The elements of the returned collection
    are in no particular order. This method is designed to
    facilitate construction of subclasses that provide more
    extensive condition monitoring facilities.

    Parameters:
    :   `condition` - the condition

    Returns:
    :   the collection of threads

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalMonitorStateException` - if this lock is not held
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the given condition is
        not associated with this lock
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the condition is null
  + ### toString

    public [String](../../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Returns a string identifying this lock, as well as its lock state.
    The state, in brackets, includes the String `"Write locks ="`
    followed by the number of reentrantly held write locks, and the
    String `"Read locks ="` followed by the number of held
    read locks.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a string identifying this lock, as well as its lock state
