# Class Phaser

[java.lang.Object](../../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

java.util.concurrent.Phaser

---

public class Phaser
extends [Object](../../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

A reusable synchronization barrier, similar in functionality to
[`CyclicBarrier`](CyclicBarrier.md "class in java.util.concurrent") and [`CountDownLatch`](CountDownLatch.md "class in java.util.concurrent") but supporting
more flexible usage.

**Registration.** Unlike the case for other barriers, the
number of parties *registered* to synchronize on a phaser
may vary over time. Tasks may be registered at any time (using
methods [`register()`](#register()), [`bulkRegister(int)`](#bulkRegister(int)), or forms of
constructors establishing initial numbers of parties), and
optionally deregistered upon any arrival (using [`arriveAndDeregister()`](#arriveAndDeregister())). As is the case with most basic
synchronization constructs, registration and deregistration affect
only internal counts; they do not establish any further internal
bookkeeping, so tasks cannot query whether they are registered.
(However, you can introduce such bookkeeping by subclassing this
class.)

**Synchronization.** Like a `CyclicBarrier`, a `Phaser` may be repeatedly awaited. Method [`arriveAndAwaitAdvance()`](#arriveAndAwaitAdvance()) has effect analogous to [`CyclicBarrier.await`](CyclicBarrier.md#await()). Each
generation of a phaser has an associated phase number. The phase
number starts at zero, and advances when all parties arrive at the
phaser, wrapping around to zero after reaching `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. The use of phase numbers enables independent
control of actions upon arrival at a phaser and upon awaiting
others, via two kinds of methods that may be invoked by any
registered party:

* **Arrival.** Methods [`arrive()`](#arrive()) and
  [`arriveAndDeregister()`](#arriveAndDeregister()) record arrival. These methods
  do not block, but return an associated *arrival phase
  number*; that is, the phase number of the phaser to which
  the arrival applied. When the final party for a given phase
  arrives, an optional action is performed and the phase
  advances. These actions are performed by the party
  triggering a phase advance, and are arranged by overriding
  method [`onAdvance(int, int)`](#onAdvance(int,int)), which also controls
  termination. Overriding this method is similar to, but more
  flexible than, providing a barrier action to a `CyclicBarrier`.* **Waiting.** Method [`awaitAdvance(int)`](#awaitAdvance(int)) requires an
    argument indicating an arrival phase number, and returns when
    the phaser advances to (or is already at) a different phase.
    Unlike similar constructions using `CyclicBarrier`,
    method `awaitAdvance` continues to wait even if the
    waiting thread is interrupted. Interruptible and timeout
    versions are also available, but exceptions encountered while
    tasks wait interruptibly or with timeout do not change the
    state of the phaser. If necessary, you can perform any
    associated recovery within handlers of those exceptions,
    often after invoking `forceTermination`. Phasers may
    also be used by tasks executing in a [`ForkJoinPool`](ForkJoinPool.md "class in java.util.concurrent").
    Progress is ensured if the pool's parallelism level can
    accommodate the maximum number of simultaneously blocked
    parties.

**Termination.** A phaser may enter a *termination*
state, that may be checked using method [`isTerminated()`](#isTerminated()). Upon
termination, all synchronization methods immediately return without
waiting for advance, as indicated by a negative return value.
Similarly, attempts to register upon termination have no effect.
Termination is triggered when an invocation of `onAdvance`
returns `true`. The default implementation returns `true` if a deregistration has caused the number of registered
parties to become zero. As illustrated below, when phasers control
actions with a fixed number of iterations, it is often convenient
to override this method to cause termination when the current phase
number reaches a threshold. Method [`forceTermination()`](#forceTermination()) is
also available to abruptly release waiting threads and allow them
to terminate.

**Tiering.** Phasers may be *tiered* (i.e.,
constructed in tree structures) to reduce contention. Phasers with
large numbers of parties that would otherwise experience heavy
synchronization contention costs may instead be set up so that
groups of sub-phasers share a common parent. This may greatly
increase throughput even though it incurs greater per-operation
overhead.

In a tree of tiered phasers, registration and deregistration of
child phasers with their parent are managed automatically.
Whenever the number of registered parties of a child phaser becomes
non-zero (as established in the [`Phaser(Phaser,int)`](#%3Cinit%3E(java.util.concurrent.Phaser,int))
constructor, [`register()`](#register()), or [`bulkRegister(int)`](#bulkRegister(int))), the
child phaser is registered with its parent. Whenever the number of
registered parties becomes zero as the result of an invocation of
[`arriveAndDeregister()`](#arriveAndDeregister()), the child phaser is deregistered
from its parent.

**Monitoring.** While synchronization methods may be invoked
only by registered parties, the current state of a phaser may be
monitored by any caller. At any given moment there are [`getRegisteredParties()`](#getRegisteredParties()) parties in total, of which [`getArrivedParties()`](#getArrivedParties()) have arrived at the current phase ([`getPhase()`](#getPhase())). When the remaining ([`getUnarrivedParties()`](#getUnarrivedParties()))
parties arrive, the phase advances. The values returned by these
methods may reflect transient states and so are not in general
useful for synchronization control. Method [`toString()`](#toString())
returns snapshots of these state queries in a form convenient for
informal monitoring.

Memory consistency effects: Actions prior to any form of arrive
method [*happen-before*](package-summary.md#MemoryVisibility) a corresponding phase advance and
onAdvance actions (if present), which in turn *happen-before*
actions following the phase advance.

**Sample usages:**

A `Phaser` may be used instead of a `CountDownLatch`
to control a one-shot action serving a variable number of parties.
The typical idiom is for the method setting this up to first
register, then start all the actions, then deregister, as in:

```
 void runTasks(List<Runnable> tasks) {
   Phaser startingGate = new Phaser(1); // "1" to register self
   // create and start threads
   for (Runnable task : tasks) {
     startingGate.register();
     new Thread(() -> {
       startingGate.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
       task.run();
     }).start();
   }

   // deregister self to allow threads to proceed
   startingGate.arriveAndDeregister();
 }
```

One way to cause a set of threads to repeatedly perform actions
for a given number of iterations is to override `onAdvance`:

```
 void startTasks(List<Runnable> tasks, int iterations) {
   Phaser phaser = new Phaser() {
     protected boolean onAdvance(int phase, int registeredParties) {
       return phase >= iterations - 1 || registeredParties == 0;
     }
   };
   phaser.register();
   for (Runnable task : tasks) {
     phaser.register();
     new Thread(() -> {
       do {
         task.run();
         phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
       } while (!phaser.isTerminated());
     }).start();
   }
   // allow threads to proceed; don't wait for them
   phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
 }
```

If the main task must later await termination, it
may re-register and then execute a similar loop:

```
   // ...
   phaser.register();
   while (!phaser.isTerminated())
     phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
```

Related constructions may be used to await particular phase numbers
in contexts where you are sure that the phase will never wrap around
`Integer.MAX_VALUE`. For example:

```
 void awaitPhase(Phaser phaser, int phase) {
   int p = phaser.register(); // assumes caller not already registered
   while (p < phase) {
     if (phaser.isTerminated())
       // ... deal with unexpected termination
     else
       p = phaser.arriveAndAwaitAdvance();
   }
   phaser.arriveAndDeregister();
 }
```

To create a set of `n` tasks using a tree of phasers, you
could use code of the following form, assuming a Task class with a
constructor accepting a `Phaser` that it registers with upon
construction. After invocation of `build(new Task[n], 0, n,
new Phaser())`, these tasks could then be started, for example by
submitting to a pool:

```
 void build(Task[] tasks, int lo, int hi, Phaser ph) {
   if (hi - lo > TASKS_PER_PHASER) {
     for (int i = lo; i < hi; i += TASKS_PER_PHASER) {
       int j = Math.min(i + TASKS_PER_PHASER, hi);
       build(tasks, i, j, new Phaser(ph));
     }
   } else {
     for (int i = lo; i < hi; ++i)
       tasks[i] = new Task(ph);
       // assumes new Task(ph) performs ph.register()
   }
 }
```

The best value of `TASKS_PER_PHASER` depends mainly on
expected synchronization rates. A value as low as four may
be appropriate for extremely small per-phase task bodies (thus
high rates), or up to hundreds for extremely large ones.

**Implementation notes:** This implementation restricts the
maximum number of parties to 65535. Attempts to register additional
parties result in `IllegalStateException`. However, you can and
should create tiered phasers to accommodate arbitrarily large sets
of participants.

        or greater than the maximum number of parties supported
* ## Method Details

  + ### register

    public int register()

    Adds a new unarrived party to this phaser. If an ongoing
    invocation of [`onAdvance(int, int)`](#onAdvance(int,int)) is in progress, this method
    may await its completion before returning. If this phaser has
    a parent, and this phaser previously had no registered parties,
    this child phaser is also registered with its parent. If
    this phaser is terminated, the attempt to register has
    no effect, and a negative value is returned.

    Returns:
    :   the arrival phase number to which this registration
        applied. If this value is negative, then this phaser has
        terminated, in which case registration has no effect.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if attempting to register more
        than the maximum supported number of parties
  + ### bulkRegister

    public int bulkRegister(int parties)

    Adds the given number of new unarrived parties to this phaser.
    If an ongoing invocation of [`onAdvance(int, int)`](#onAdvance(int,int)) is in progress,
    this method may await its completion before returning. If this
    phaser has a parent, and the given number of parties is greater
    than zero, and this phaser previously had no registered
    parties, this child phaser is also registered with its parent.
    If this phaser is terminated, the attempt to register has no
    effect, and a negative value is returned.

    Parameters:
    :   `parties` - the number of additional parties required to
        advance to the next phase

    Returns:
    :   the arrival phase number to which this registration
        applied. If this value is negative, then this phaser has
        terminated, in which case registration has no effect.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if attempting to register more
        than the maximum supported number of parties
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `parties < 0`
  + ### arrive

    public int arrive()

    Arrives at this phaser, without waiting for others to arrive.

    It is a usage error for an unregistered party to invoke this
    method. However, this error may result in an `IllegalStateException` only upon some subsequent operation on
    this phaser, if ever.

    Returns:
    :   the arrival phase number, or a negative value if terminated

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if not terminated and the number
        of unarrived parties would become negative
  + ### arriveAndDeregister

    public int arriveAndDeregister()

    Arrives at this phaser and deregisters from it without waiting
    for others to arrive. Deregistration reduces the number of
    parties required to advance in future phases. If this phaser
    has a parent, and deregistration causes this phaser to have
    zero parties, this phaser is also deregistered from its parent.

    It is a usage error for an unregistered party to invoke this
    method. However, this error may result in an `IllegalStateException` only upon some subsequent operation on
    this phaser, if ever.

    Returns:
    :   the arrival phase number, or a negative value if terminated

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if not terminated and the number
        of registered or unarrived parties would become negative
  + ### arriveAndAwaitAdvance

    public int arriveAndAwaitAdvance()

    Arrives at this phaser and awaits others. Equivalent in effect
    to `awaitAdvance(arrive())`. If you need to await with
    interruption or timeout, you can arrange this with an analogous
    construction using one of the other forms of the `awaitAdvance` method. If instead you need to deregister upon
    arrival, use `awaitAdvance(arriveAndDeregister())`.

    It is a usage error for an unregistered party to invoke this
    method. However, this error may result in an `IllegalStateException` only upon some subsequent operation on
    this phaser, if ever.

    Returns:
    :   the arrival phase number, or the (negative)
        [current phase](#getPhase()) if terminated

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if not terminated and the number
        of unarrived parties would become negative
  + ### awaitAdvance

    public int awaitAdvance(int phase)

    Awaits the phase of this phaser to advance from the given phase
    value, returning immediately if the current phase is not equal
    to the given phase value or this phaser is terminated.

    Parameters:
    :   `phase` - an arrival phase number, or negative value if
        terminated; this argument is normally the value returned by a
        previous call to `arrive` or `arriveAndDeregister`.

    Returns:
    :   the next arrival phase number, or the argument if it is
        negative, or the (negative) [current phase](#getPhase())
        if terminated
  + ### awaitAdvanceInterruptibly

    public int awaitAdvanceInterruptibly(int phase)
    throws [InterruptedException](../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang")

    Awaits the phase of this phaser to advance from the given phase
    value, throwing `InterruptedException` if interrupted
    while waiting, or returning immediately if the current phase is
    not equal to the given phase value or this phaser is
    terminated.

    Parameters:
    :   `phase` - an arrival phase number, or negative value if
        terminated; this argument is normally the value returned by a
        previous call to `arrive` or `arriveAndDeregister`.

    Returns:
    :   the next arrival phase number, or the argument if it is
        negative, or the (negative) [current phase](#getPhase())
        if terminated

    Throws:
    :   `InterruptedException` - if thread interrupted while waiting
  + ### awaitAdvanceInterruptibly

    public int awaitAdvanceInterruptibly(int phase,
    long timeout,
    [TimeUnit](TimeUnit.md "enum class in java.util.concurrent") unit)
    throws [InterruptedException](../../lang/InterruptedException.md "class in java.lang"),
    [TimeoutException](TimeoutException.md "class in java.util.concurrent")

    Awaits the phase of this phaser to advance from the given phase
    value or the given timeout to elapse, throwing `InterruptedException` if interrupted while waiting, or
    returning immediately if the current phase is not equal to the
    given phase value or this phaser is terminated.

    Parameters:
    :   `phase` - an arrival phase number, or negative value if
        terminated; this argument is normally the value returned by a
        previous call to `arrive` or `arriveAndDeregister`.
    :   `timeout` - how long to wait before giving up, in units of
        `unit`
    :   `unit` - a `TimeUnit` determining how to interpret the
        `timeout` parameter

    Returns:
    :   the next arrival phase number, or the argument if it is
        negative, or the (negative) [current phase](#getPhase())
        if terminated

    Throws:
    :   `InterruptedException` - if thread interrupted while waiting
    :   `TimeoutException` - if timed out while waiting
  + ### forceTermination

    public void forceTermination()

    Forces this phaser to enter termination state. Counts of
    registered parties are unaffected. If this phaser is a member
    of a tiered set of phasers, then all of the phasers in the set
    are terminated. If this phaser is already terminated, this
    method has no effect. This method may be useful for
    coordinating recovery after one or more tasks encounter
    unexpected exceptions.
  + ### getPhase

    public final int getPhase()

    Returns the current phase number. The maximum phase number is
    `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, after which it restarts at
    zero. Upon termination, the phase number is negative,
    in which case the prevailing phase prior to termination
    may be obtained via `getPhase() + Integer.MIN_VALUE`.

    Returns:
    :   the phase number, or a negative value if terminated
  + ### getRegisteredParties

    public int getRegisteredParties()

    Returns the number of parties registered at this phaser.

    Returns:
    :   the number of parties
  + ### getArrivedParties

    public int getArrivedParties()

    Returns the number of registered parties that have arrived at
    the current phase of this phaser. If this phaser has terminated,
    the returned value is meaningless and arbitrary.

    Returns:
    :   the number of arrived parties
  + ### getUnarrivedParties

    public int getUnarrivedParties()

    Returns the number of registered parties that have not yet
    arrived at the current phase of this phaser. If this phaser has
    terminated, the returned value is meaningless and arbitrary.

    Returns:
    :   the number of unarrived parties
  + ### getParent

    public [Phaser](Phaser.md "class in java.util.concurrent") getParent()

    Returns the parent of this phaser, or `null` if none.

    Returns:
    :   the parent of this phaser, or `null` if none
  + ### getRoot

    public [Phaser](Phaser.md "class in java.util.concurrent") getRoot()

    Returns the root ancestor of this phaser, which is the same as
    this phaser if it has no parent.

    Returns:
    :   the root ancestor of this phaser
  + ### isTerminated

    public boolean isTerminated()

    Returns `true` if this phaser has been terminated.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this phaser has been terminated
  + ### onAdvance

    protected boolean onAdvance(int phase,
    int registeredParties)

    Overridable method to perform an action upon impending phase
    advance, and to control termination. This method is invoked
    upon arrival of the party advancing this phaser (when all other
    waiting parties are dormant). If this method returns `true`, this phaser will be set to a final termination state
    upon advance, and subsequent calls to [`isTerminated()`](#isTerminated())
    will return true. Any (unchecked) Exception or Error thrown by
    an invocation of this method is propagated to the party
    attempting to advance this phaser, in which case no advance
    occurs.

    The arguments to this method provide the state of the phaser
    prevailing for the current transition. The effects of invoking
    arrival, registration, and waiting methods on this phaser from
    within `onAdvance` are unspecified and should not be
    relied on.

    If this phaser is a member of a tiered set of phasers, then
    `onAdvance` is invoked only for its root phaser on each
    advance.

    To support the most common use cases, the default
    implementation of this method returns `true` when the
    number of registered parties has become zero as the result of a
    party invoking `arriveAndDeregister`. You can disable
    this behavior, thus enabling continuation upon future
    registrations, by overriding this method to always return
    `false`:

    ```
     Phaser phaser = new Phaser() {
       protected boolean onAdvance(int phase, int parties) { return false; }
     };
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `phase` - the current phase number on entry to this method,
        before this phaser is advanced
    :   `registeredParties` - the current number of registered parties

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this phaser should terminate
  + ### toString

    public [String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Returns a string identifying this phaser, as well as its
    state. The state, in brackets, includes the String `"phase = "` followed by the phase number, `"parties = "`
    followed by the number of registered parties, and `"arrived = "` followed by the number of arrived parties.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a string identifying this phaser, as well as its state
