public final class UUID
extends [Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Serializable](../io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io"), [Comparable](../lang/Comparable.md "interface in java.lang")<[UUID](UUID.md "class in java.util")>

A class that represents an immutable universally unique identifier (UUID).
A UUID represents a 128-bit value.

There exist different variants of these global identifiers. The methods
of this class are for manipulating the Leach-Salz variant, although the
constructors allow the creation of any variant of UUID (described below).

The layout of a variant 2 (Leach-Salz) UUID is as follows:
The most significant long consists of the following unsigned fields:

```
 0xFFFFFFFF00000000 time_low
 0x00000000FFFF0000 time_mid
 0x000000000000F000 version
 0x0000000000000FFF time_hi
```

The least significant long consists of the following unsigned fields:

```
 0xC000000000000000 variant
 0x3FFF000000000000 clock_seq
 0x0000FFFFFFFFFFFF node
```

The variant field contains a value which identifies the layout of the
`UUID`. The bit layout described above is valid only for a `UUID` with a variant value of 2, which indicates the Leach-Salz variant.

The version field holds a value that describes the type of this `UUID`. There are four different basic types of UUIDs: time-based, DCE
security, name-based, and randomly generated UUIDs. These types have a
version value of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace*](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt), section 4.2

  + ### timestamp

    public long timestamp()

    The timestamp value associated with this UUID.

    The 60 bit timestamp value is constructed from the time\_low,
    time\_mid, and time\_hi fields of this `UUID`. The resulting
    timestamp is measured in 100-nanosecond units since midnight,
    October 15, 1582 UTC.

    The timestamp value is only meaningful in a time-based UUID, which
    has version type 1. If this `UUID` is not a time-based UUID then
    this method throws UnsupportedOperationException.

    Returns:
    :   The timestamp of this `UUID`.

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - If this UUID is not a version 1 UUID
  + ### clockSequence

    public int clockSequence()

    The clock sequence value associated with this UUID.

    The 14 bit clock sequence value is constructed from the clock
    sequence field of this UUID. The clock sequence field is used to
    guarantee temporal uniqueness in a time-based UUID.

    The `clockSequence` value is only meaningful in a time-based
    UUID, which has version type 1. If this UUID is not a time-based UUID
    then this method throws UnsupportedOperationException.

    Returns:
    :   The clock sequence of this `UUID`

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - If this UUID is not a version 1 UUID
  + ### node

    public long node()

    The node value associated with this UUID.

    The 48 bit node value is constructed from the node field of this
    UUID. This field is intended to hold the IEEE 802 address of the machine
    that generated this UUID to guarantee spatial uniqueness.

    The node value is only meaningful in a time-based UUID, which has
    version type 1. If this UUID is not a time-based UUID then this method
    throws UnsupportedOperationException.

    Returns:
    :   The node value of this `UUID`

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - If this UUID is not a version 1 UUID
  + ### toString

    >  variant_and_sequence   = 2*<hexOctet>
    >  node                   = 6*<hexOctet>
    >  hexOctet               = <hexDigit><hexDigit>
    >  hexDigit               =
    >        "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
