extends [Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Serializable](../io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io"), [Cloneable](../lang/Cloneable.md "interface in java.lang"), [Comparable](../lang/Comparable.md "interface in java.lang")<[Date](Date.md "class in java.util")>

The class `Date` represents a specific instant
in time, with millisecond precision.

Prior to JDK 1.1, the class `Date` had two additional
functions. It allowed the interpretation of dates as year, month, day, hour,
minute, and second values. It also allowed the formatting and parsing
of date strings. Unfortunately, the API for these functions was not
amenable to internationalization. As of JDK 1.1, the
`Calendar` class should be used to convert between dates and time
fields and the `DateFormat` class should be used to format and
parse date strings.
The corresponding methods in `Date` are deprecated.

Although the `Date` class is intended to reflect
coordinated universal time (UTC), it may not do so exactly,
depending on the host environment of the Java Virtual Machine.
Nearly all modern operating systems assume that 1 day =
24 × 60 × 60 = 86400 seconds
in all cases. In UTC, however, about once every year or two there
is an extra second, called a "leap second." The leap
second is always added as the last second of the day, and always
on December 31 or June 30. For example, the last minute of the
year 1995 was 61 seconds long, thanks to an added leap second.
Most computer clocks are not accurate enough to be able to reflect
the leap-second distinction.

Some computer standards are defined in terms of Greenwich mean
time (GMT), which is equivalent to universal time (UT). GMT is
the "civil" name for the standard; UT is the
"scientific" name for the same standard. The
distinction between UTC and UT is that UTC is based on an atomic
clock and UT is based on astronomical observations, which for all
practical purposes is an invisibly fine hair to split. Because the
earth's rotation is not uniform (it slows down and speeds up
in complicated ways), UT does not always flow uniformly. Leap
seconds are introduced as needed into UTC so as to keep UTC within
0.9 seconds of UT1, which is a version of UT with certain
corrections applied. There are other time and date systems as
well; for example, the time scale used by the satellite-based
global positioning system (GPS) is synchronized to UTC but is
*not* adjusted for leap seconds. An interesting source of
further information is the United States Naval Observatory (USNO):
> ```
>      https://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO
> ```

and the material regarding "Systems of Time" at:
> ```
>      https://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time/master-clock/systems-of-time
> ```

which has descriptions of various different time systems including
UT, UT1, and UTC.

In all methods of class `Date` that accept or return
year, month, date, hours, minutes, and seconds values, the
following representations are used:

* A year *y* is represented by the integer
  *y* `- 1900`.* A month is represented by an integer from 0 to 11; 0 is January,
    1 is February, and so forth; thus 11 is December.* A date (day of month) is represented by an integer from 1 to 31
      in the usual manner.* An hour is represented by an integer from 0 to 23. Thus, the hour
        from midnight to 1 a.m. is hour 0, and the hour from noon to 1
        p.m. is hour 12.* A minute is represented by an integer from 0 to 59 in the usual manner.* A second is represented by an integer from 0 to 61; the values 60 and
            61 occur only for leap seconds and even then only in Java
            implementations that actually track leap seconds correctly. Because
            of the manner in which leap seconds are currently introduced, it is
            extremely unlikely that two leap seconds will occur in the same
            minute, but this specification follows the date and time conventions
            for ISO C.

In all cases, arguments given to methods for these purposes need
not fall within the indicated ranges; for example, a date may be
specified as January 32 and is interpreted as meaning February 1.

    public static long UTC(int year,
    int month,
    int date,
    int hrs,
    int min,
    int sec)

    Deprecated.

    As of JDK version 1.1,
    replaced by `Calendar.set(year + 1900, month, date, hrs, min, sec)`
    or `GregorianCalendar(year + 1900, month, date, hrs, min, sec)`, using a UTC
    `TimeZone`, followed by `Calendar.getTime().getTime()`.

    Determines the date and time based on the arguments. The
    arguments are interpreted as a year, month, day of the month,
    hour of the day, minute within the hour, and second within the
    minute, exactly as for the `Date` constructor with six
    arguments, except that the arguments are interpreted relative
    to UTC rather than to the local time zone. The time indicated is
    returned represented as the distance, measured in milliseconds,
    of that time from the epoch (00:00:00 GMT on January 1, 1970).

    Parameters:
    :   `year` - the year minus 1900.
    :   `month` - the month between 0-11.
    :   `date` - the day of the month between 1-31.
    :   `hrs` - the hours between 0-23.
    :   `min` - the minutes between 0-59.
    :   `sec` - the seconds between 0-59.

    Returns:
    :   the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT for
        the date and time specified by the arguments.

  + ### parse

    [@Deprecated](../lang/Deprecated.md "annotation interface in java.lang")
    public static long parse([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") s)

    Deprecated.

    As of JDK version 1.1,
    replaced by `DateFormat.parse(String s)`.

    Attempts to interpret the string `s` as a representation
    of a date and time. If the attempt is successful, the time
    indicated is returned represented as the distance, measured in
    milliseconds, of that time from the epoch (00:00:00 GMT on
    January 1, 1970). If the attempt fails, an
    `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.

    It accepts many syntaxes; in particular, it recognizes the IETF
    standard date syntax: "Sat, 12 Aug 1995 13:30:00 GMT". It also
    understands the continental U.S. time-zone abbreviations, but for
    general use, a time-zone offset should be used: "Sat, 12 Aug 1995
    13:30:00 GMT+0430" (4 hours, 30 minutes west of the Greenwich
    meridian). If no time zone is specified, the local time zone is
    assumed. GMT and UTC are considered equivalent.

    The string `s` is processed from left to right, looking for
    data of interest. Any material in `s` that is within the
    ASCII parenthesis characters `(` and `)` is ignored.
    Parentheses may be nested. Otherwise, the only characters permitted
    within `s` are these ASCII characters:
    > ```
    >  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    >  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    >  0123456789,+-:/
    > ```

    and whitespace characters.

    A consecutive sequence of decimal digits is treated as a decimal
    number:
    - If a number is preceded by `+` or `-` and a year
      has already been recognized, then the number is a time-zone
      offset. If the number is less than 24, it is an offset measured
      in hours. Otherwise, it is regarded as an offset in minutes,
      expressed in 24-hour time format without punctuation. A
      preceding `-` means a westward offset. Time zone offsets
      are always relative to UTC (Greenwich). Thus, for example,
      `-5` occurring in the string would mean "five hours west
      of Greenwich" and `+0430` would mean "four hours and
      thirty minutes east of Greenwich." It is permitted for the
      string to specify `GMT`, `UT`, or `UTC`
      redundantly-for example, `GMT-5` or `utc+0430`.- The number is regarded as a year number if one of the
        following conditions is true:
        * The number is equal to or greater than 70 and followed by a
          space, comma, slash, or end of string* The number is less than 70, and both a month and a day of
            the month have already been recognizedIf the recognized year number is less than 100, it is
        interpreted as an abbreviated year relative to a century of
        which dates are within 80 years before and 19 years after
        the time when the Date class is initialized.
        After adjusting the year number, 1900 is subtracted from
        it. For example, if the current year is 1999 then years in
        the range 19 to 99 are assumed to mean 1919 to 1999, while
        years from 0 to 18 are assumed to mean 2000 to 2018. Note
        that this is slightly different from the interpretation of
        years less than 100 that is used in [`SimpleDateFormat`](../text/SimpleDateFormat.md "class in java.text").- If the number is followed by a colon, it is regarded as an hour,
          unless an hour has already been recognized, in which case it is
          regarded as a minute.- If the number is followed by a slash, it is regarded as a month
            (it is decreased by 1 to produce a number in the range `0`
            to `11`), unless a month has already been recognized, in
            which case it is regarded as a day of the month.- If the number is followed by whitespace, a comma, a hyphen, or
              end of string, then if an hour has been recognized but not a
              minute, it is regarded as a minute; otherwise, if a minute has
              been recognized but not a second, it is regarded as a second;
              otherwise, it is regarded as a day of the month.

    A consecutive sequence of letters is regarded as a word and treated
    as follows:
    - A word that matches `AM`, ignoring case, is ignored (but
      the parse fails if an hour has not been recognized or is less
      than `1` or greater than `12`).- A word that matches `PM`, ignoring case, adds `12`
        to the hour (but the parse fails if an hour has not been
        recognized or is less than `1` or greater than `12`).- Any word that matches any prefix of `SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY,
          WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY`, or `SATURDAY`, ignoring
          case, is ignored. For example, `sat, Friday, TUE`, and
          `Thurs` are ignored.- Otherwise, any word that matches any prefix of `JANUARY,
            FEBRUARY, MARCH, APRIL, MAY, JUNE, JULY, AUGUST, SEPTEMBER,
            OCTOBER, NOVEMBER`, or `DECEMBER`, ignoring case, and
            considering them in the order given here, is recognized as
            specifying a month and is converted to a number (`0` to
            `11`). For example, `aug, Sept, april`, and
            `NOV` are recognized as months. So is `Ma`, which
            is recognized as `MARCH`, not `MAY`.- Any word that matches `GMT, UT`, or `UTC`, ignoring
              case, is treated as referring to UTC.- Any word that matches `EST, CST, MST`, or `PST`,
                ignoring case, is recognized as referring to the time zone in
                North America that is five, six, seven, or eight hours west of
                Greenwich, respectively. Any word that matches `EDT, CDT,
                MDT`, or `PDT`, ignoring case, is recognized as
                referring to the same time zone, respectively, during daylight
                saving time.

    Once the entire string s has been scanned, it is converted to a time
    result in one of two ways. If a time zone or time-zone offset has been
    recognized, then the year, month, day of month, hour, minute, and
    second are interpreted in UTC and then the time-zone offset is
    applied. Otherwise, the year, month, day of month, hour, minute, and
    second are interpreted in the local time zone.

    Parameters:
    :   `s` - a string to be parsed as a date.

    Returns:
    :   the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT
        represented by the string argument.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `s` cannot be interpreted as a
        representation of a date and time.

    public void setYear(int year)

    Deprecated.

    As of JDK version 1.1,
    replaced by `Calendar.set(Calendar.YEAR, year + 1900)`.

    Sets the year of this `Date` object to be the specified
    value plus 1900. This `Date` object is modified so
    that it represents a point in time within the specified year,
    with the month, date, hour, minute, and second the same as
    before, as interpreted in the local time zone. (Of course, if
    the date was February 29, for example, and the year is set to a
    non-leap year, then the new date will be treated as if it were
    on March 1.)

    Parameters:
    :   `year` - the year value.

    As of JDK version 1.1,
    replaced by `Calendar.set(Calendar.MONTH, int month)`.

    Sets the month of this date to the specified value. This
    `Date` object is modified so that it represents a point
    in time within the specified month, with the year, date, hour,
    minute, and second the same as before, as interpreted in the
    local time zone. If the date was October 31, for example, and
    the month is set to June, then the new date will be treated as
    if it were on July 1, because June has only 30 days.

    Parameters:
    :   `month` - the month value between 0-11.

    Specified by:
    :   `compareTo` in interface `Comparable<Date>`

    Parameters:
    :   `anotherDate` - the `Date` to be compared.

    Returns:
    :   the value `0` if the argument Date is equal to
        this Date; a value less than `0` if this Date
        is before the Date argument; and a value greater than
        `0` if this Date is after the Date argument.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `anotherDate` is null.

    Since:
    :   1.2
  + ### hashCode

    > ```

    where:
    - `dow` is the day of the week (`Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed,
      Thu, Fri, Sat`).- `mon` is the month (`Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun,
        Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec`).- `dd` is the day of the month (`01` through
          `31`), as two decimal digits.- `hh` is the hour of the day (`00` through
            `23`), as two decimal digits.- `mm` is the minute within the hour (`00` through
              `59`), as two decimal digits.- `ss` is the second within the minute (`00` through
                `61`, as two decimal digits.- `zzz` is the time zone (and may reflect daylight saving
                  time). Standard time zone abbreviations include those
                  recognized by the method `parse`. If time zone
                  information is not available, then `zzz` is empty -
                  that is, it consists of no characters at all.- `yyyy` is the year, as four decimal digits.

    Overrides:

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toLocaleString()

    Deprecated.

    As of JDK version 1.1,
    replaced by `DateFormat.format(Date date)`.

    Creates a string representation of this `Date` object in an
    implementation-dependent form. The intent is that the form should
    be familiar to the user of the Java application, wherever it may
    happen to be running. The intent is comparable to that of the
    "`%c`" format supported by the `strftime()`
    function of ISO C.

    Returns:
    :   a string representation of this date, using the locale
        conventions.

    Deprecated.

    As of JDK version 1.1,
    replaced by `DateFormat.format(Date date)`, using a
    GMT `TimeZone`.

    Creates a string representation of this `Date` object of
    the form:
    > ```
    >  d mon yyyy hh:mm:ss GMT
    > ```

    where:
    - *d* is the day of the month (`1` through `31`),
      as one or two decimal digits.- *mon* is the month (`Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul,
        Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec`).- *yyyy* is the year, as four decimal digits.- *hh* is the hour of the day (`00` through `23`),
            as two decimal digits.- *mm* is the minute within the hour (`00` through
              `59`), as two decimal digits.- *ss* is the second within the minute (`00` through
                `61`), as two decimal digits.- *GMT* is exactly the ASCII letters "`GMT`" to indicate
                  Greenwich Mean Time.

    The result does not depend on the local time zone.

    Returns:
    :   a string representation of this date, using the Internet GMT
        conventions.

    As of JDK version 1.1,
    replaced by `-(Calendar.get(Calendar.ZONE_OFFSET) +
    Calendar.get(Calendar.DST_OFFSET)) / (60 * 1000)`.

    Returns the offset, measured in minutes, for the local time zone
    relative to UTC that is appropriate for the time represented by
    this `Date` object.

    For example, in Massachusetts, five time zones west of Greenwich:
    > ```
    >  new Date(96, 1, 14).getTimezoneOffset() returns 300
    > ```

    because on February 14, 1996, standard time (Eastern Standard Time)
    is in use, which is offset five hours from UTC; but:
    > ```
    >  new Date(96, 5, 1).getTimezoneOffset() returns 240
    > ```

    because on June 1, 1996, daylight saving time (Eastern Daylight Time)
    is in use, which is offset only four hours from UTC.

    This method produces the same result as if it computed:
    > ```
    >  (this.getTime() - UTC(this.getYear(),
    >                        this.getMonth(),
    >                        this.getDate(),
    >                        this.getHours(),
    >                        this.getMinutes(),
    >                        this.getSeconds())) / (60 * 1000)

  + ### from

    public static [Date](Date.md "class in java.util") from([Instant](../time/Instant.md "class in java.time") instant)

    Obtains an instance of `Date` from an `Instant` object.

    `Instant` uses a precision of nanoseconds, whereas `Date`
    uses a precision of milliseconds. The conversion will truncate any
    excess precision information as though the amount in nanoseconds was
    subject to integer division by one million.

    `Instant` can store points on the time-line further in the future
    and further in the past than `Date`. In this scenario, this method
    will throw an exception.

    Parameters:
    :   `instant` - the instant to convert

    Returns:
    :   a `Date` representing the same point on the time-line as
        the provided instant

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `instant` is null.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the instant is too large to
        represent as a `Date`

    Since:
    :   1.8
  + ### toInstant

    public [Instant](../time/Instant.md "class in java.time") toInstant()

    Converts this `Date` object to an `Instant`.

    The conversion creates an `Instant` that represents the same
    point on the time-line as this `Date`.

    Returns:
    :   an instant representing the same point on the time-line as
        this `Date` object

    Since:
    :   1.8
