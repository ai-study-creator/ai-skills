# Interface MatchResult

All Known Implementing Classes:

public interface MatchResult

The result of a match operation.

This interface contains query methods used to determine the
results of a match against a regular expression. The match boundaries,
groups and group boundaries can be seen but not modified through
a `MatchResult`.

* ## Method Details

  + ### start

    int start()

    Returns the start index of the match.

    Returns:
    :   The index of the first character matched

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - If no match has yet been attempted,
        or if the previous match operation failed
  + ### start

    int start(int group)

    Returns the start index of the subsequence captured by the given group
    during this match.

    [Capturing groups](Pattern.md#cg) are indexed from left
    to right, starting at one. Group zero denotes the entire pattern, so
    the expression *m.*`start(0)` is equivalent to
    *m.*`start()`.

    Parameters:
    :   `group` - The index of a capturing group in this matcher's pattern

    Returns:
    :   The index of the first character captured by the group,
        or `-1` if the match was successful but the group
        itself did not match anything

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - If no match has yet been attempted,
        or if the previous match operation failed
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If there is no capturing group in the pattern
        with the given index
  + ### start

    default int start([String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name)

    Returns the start index of the subsequence captured by the given
    [named-capturing group](Pattern.md#groupname) during the
    previous match operation.

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - The name of a named-capturing group in this matcher's pattern

    Returns:
    :   The index of the first character captured by the group,
        or `-1` if the match was successful but the group
        itself did not match anything

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - If no match has yet been attempted,
        or if the previous match operation failed
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - If there is no capturing group in the pattern
        with the given name

    Since:
    :   20
  + ### end

    int end()

    Returns the offset after the last character matched.

    Returns:
    :   The offset after the last character matched

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - If no match has yet been attempted,
        or if the previous match operation failed
  + ### end

    int end(int group)

    Returns the offset after the last character of the subsequence
    captured by the given group during this match.

    [Capturing groups](Pattern.md#cg) are indexed from left
    to right, starting at one. Group zero denotes the entire pattern, so
    the expression *m.*`end(0)` is equivalent to
    *m.*`end()`.

    Parameters:
    :   `group` - The index of a capturing group in this matcher's pattern

    Returns:
    :   The offset after the last character captured by the group,
        or `-1` if the match was successful
        but the group itself did not match anything

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - If no match has yet been attempted,
        or if the previous match operation failed
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If there is no capturing group in the pattern
        with the given index
  + ### end

    default int end([String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name)

    Returns the offset after the last character of the subsequence
    captured by the given [named-capturing
    group](Pattern.md#groupname) during the previous match operation.

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - The name of a named-capturing group in this matcher's pattern

    Returns:
    :   The offset after the last character captured by the group,
        or `-1` if the match was successful
        but the group itself did not match anything

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - If no match has yet been attempted,
        or if the previous match operation failed
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - If there is no capturing group in the pattern
        with the given name

    Since:
    :   20
  + ### group

    [String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") group()

    Returns the input subsequence matched by the previous match.

    For a matcher *m* with input sequence *s*,
    the expressions *m.*`group()` and
    *s.*`substring(`*m.*`start(),` *m.*`end())`
    are equivalent.

    Note that some patterns, for example `a*`, match the empty
    string. This method will return the empty string when the pattern
    successfully matches the empty string in the input.

    Returns:
    :   The (possibly empty) subsequence matched by the previous match,
        in string form

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - If no match has yet been attempted,
        or if the previous match operation failed
  + ### group

    [String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") group(int group)

    Returns the input subsequence captured by the given group during the
    previous match operation.

    For a matcher *m*, input sequence *s*, and group index
    *g*, the expressions *m.*`group(`*g*`)` and
    *s.*`substring(`*m.*`start(`*g*`),` *m.*`end(`*g*`))`
    are equivalent.

    [Capturing groups](Pattern.md#cg) are indexed from left
    to right, starting at one. Group zero denotes the entire pattern, so
    the expression `m.group(0)` is equivalent to `m.group()`.

    If the match was successful but the group specified failed to match
    any part of the input sequence, then `null` is returned. Note
    that some groups, for example `(a*)`, match the empty string.
    This method will return the empty string when such a group successfully
    matches the empty string in the input.

    Parameters:
    :   `group` - The index of a capturing group in this matcher's pattern

    Returns:
    :   The (possibly empty) subsequence captured by the group
        during the previous match, or `null` if the group
        failed to match part of the input

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - If no match has yet been attempted,
        or if the previous match operation failed
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If there is no capturing group in the pattern
        with the given index
  + ### group

    default [String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") group([String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name)

    Returns the input subsequence captured by the given
    [named-capturing group](Pattern.md#groupname) during the
    previous match operation.

    If the match was successful but the group specified failed to match
    any part of the input sequence, then `null` is returned. Note
    that some groups, for example `(a*)`, match the empty string.
    This method will return the empty string when such a group successfully
    matches the empty string in the input.

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - The name of a named-capturing group in this matcher's pattern

    Returns:
    :   The (possibly empty) subsequence captured by the named group
        during the previous match, or `null` if the group
        failed to match part of the input

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalStateException` - If no match has yet been attempted,
        or if the previous match operation failed
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - If there is no capturing group in the pattern
        with the given name

    Since:
    :   20
  + ### groupCount

    int groupCount()

    Returns the number of capturing groups in this match result's pattern.

    Group zero denotes the entire pattern by convention. It is not
    included in this count.

    Any non-negative integer smaller than or equal to the value
    returned by this method is guaranteed to be a valid group index for
    this matcher.

    Returns:
    :   The number of capturing groups in this matcher's pattern
  + ### namedGroups

    default [Map](../Map.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang"),[Integer](../../lang/Integer.md "class in java.lang")> namedGroups()

    Returns an unmodifiable map from capturing group names to group numbers.
    If there are no named groups, returns an empty map.

    Returns:
    :   an unmodifiable map from capturing group names to group numbers

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the implementation does not
        support named groups.

    Since:
    :   20
  + ### hasMatch

    default boolean hasMatch()

    Returns whether `this` contains a valid match from
    a previous match or find operation.

    Returns:
    :   whether `this` contains a valid match

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the implementation cannot report
        whether it has a match

    Since:
    :   20
