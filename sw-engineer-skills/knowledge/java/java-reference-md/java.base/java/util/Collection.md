public interface Collection<E>
extends [Iterable](../lang/Iterable.md "interface in java.lang")<E>

The root interface in the *collection hierarchy*. A collection
represents a group of objects, known as its *elements*. Some
collections allow duplicate elements and others do not. Some are ordered,
and others are unordered. Collections that have a defined
[encounter order](SequencedCollection.md#encounter)
are generally subtypes of the [`SequencedCollection`](SequencedCollection.md "interface in java.util") interface.
The JDK does not provide any *direct*
implementations of this interface: it provides implementations of more
specific subinterfaces like `Set` and `List`. This interface
is typically used to pass collections around and manipulate them where
maximum generality is desired.

*Bags* or *multisets* (unordered collections that may contain
duplicate elements) should implement this interface directly.

All general-purpose `Collection` implementation classes (which
typically implement `Collection` indirectly through one of its
subinterfaces) should provide two "standard" constructors: a void (no
arguments) constructor, which creates an empty collection, and a
constructor with a single argument of type `Collection`, which
creates a new collection with the same elements as its argument. In
effect, the latter constructor allows the user to copy any collection,
producing an equivalent collection of the desired implementation type.
There is no way to enforce this convention (as interfaces cannot contain
constructors) but all of the general-purpose `Collection`
implementations in the Java platform libraries comply.

Certain methods are specified to be
*optional*. If a collection implementation doesn't implement a
particular operation, it should define the corresponding method to throw
`UnsupportedOperationException`. Such methods are marked "optional
operation" in method specifications of the collections interfaces.

Some collection implementations
have restrictions on the elements that they may contain.
For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
and some have restrictions on the types of their elements. Attempting to
add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
`NullPointerException` or `ClassCastException`. Attempting
to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
behavior and some will exhibit the latter. More generally, attempting an
operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
the insertion of an ineligible element into the collection may throw an
exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
interface.

It is up to each collection to determine its own synchronization
policy. In the absence of a stronger guarantee by the
implementation, undefined behavior may result from the invocation
of any method on a collection that is being mutated by another
thread; this includes direct invocations, passing the collection to
a method that might perform invocations, and using an existing
iterator to examine the collection.

Many methods in Collections Framework interfaces are defined in
terms of the [`equals`](../lang/Object.md#equals(java.lang.Object)) method. For example,
the specification for the [`contains(Object o)`](#contains(java.lang.Object))
method says: "returns `true` if and only if this collection
contains at least one element `e` such that
`(o==null ? e==null : o.equals(e))`." This specification should
*not* be construed to imply that invoking `Collection.contains`
with a non-null argument `o` will cause `o.equals(e)` to be
invoked for any element `e`. Implementations are free to implement
optimizations whereby the `equals` invocation is avoided, for
example, by first comparing the hash codes of the two elements. (The
[`Object.hashCode()`](../lang/Object.md#hashCode()) specification guarantees that two objects with
unequal hash codes cannot be equal.) More generally, implementations of
the various Collections Framework interfaces are free to take advantage of
the specified behavior of underlying [`Object`](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") methods wherever the
implementor deems it appropriate.

Some collection operations which perform recursive traversal of the
collection may fail with an exception for self-referential instances where
the collection directly or indirectly contains itself. This includes the
`clone()`, `equals()`, `hashCode()` and `toString()`
methods. Implementations may optionally handle the self-referential scenario,
however most current implementations do not do so.

## View Collections

Most collections manage storage for elements they contain. By contrast, *view
collections* themselves do not store elements, but instead they rely on a
backing collection to store the actual elements. Operations that are not handled
by the view collection itself are delegated to the backing collection. Examples of
view collections include the wrapper collections returned by methods such as
[`Collections.checkedCollection`](Collections.md#checkedCollection(java.util.Collection,java.lang.Class)),
[`Collections.synchronizedCollection`](Collections.md#synchronizedCollection(java.util.Collection)), and
[`Collections.unmodifiableCollection`](Collections.md#unmodifiableCollection(java.util.Collection)).
Other examples of view collections include collections that provide a
different representation of the same elements, for example, as
provided by [`List.subList`](List.md#subList(int,int)),
[`NavigableSet.subSet`](NavigableSet.md#subSet(E,boolean,E,boolean)),
[`Map.entrySet`](Map.md#entrySet()), or
[`SequencedCollection.reversed`](SequencedCollection.md#reversed()).
Any changes made to the backing collection are visible in the view collection.
Correspondingly, any changes made to the view collection — if changes
are permitted — are written through to the backing collection.
Although they technically aren't collections, instances of
[`Iterator`](Iterator.md "interface in java.util") and [`ListIterator`](ListIterator.md "interface in java.util") can also allow modifications
to be written through to the backing collection, and in some cases,
modifications to the backing collection will be visible to the Iterator
during iteration.

## Unmodifiable Collections

Certain methods of this interface are considered "destructive" and are called
"mutator" methods in that they modify the group of objects contained within
the collection on which they operate. They can be specified to throw
`UnsupportedOperationException` if this collection implementation
does not support the operation. Such methods should (but are not required
to) throw an `UnsupportedOperationException` if the invocation would
have no effect on the collection. For example, consider a collection that
does not support the [`add`](#add(E)) operation. What will happen if the
[`addAll`](#addAll(java.util.Collection)) method is invoked on this collection, with an empty
collection as the argument? The addition of zero elements has no effect,
so it is permissible for this collection simply to do nothing and not to throw
an exception. However, it is recommended that such cases throw an exception
unconditionally, as throwing only in certain cases can lead to
programming errors.

An *unmodifiable collection* is a collection, all of whose
mutator methods (as defined above) are specified to throw
`UnsupportedOperationException`. Such a collection thus cannot be
modified by calling any methods on it. For a collection to be properly
unmodifiable, any view collections derived from it must also be unmodifiable.
For example, if a List is unmodifiable, the List returned by
[`List.subList`](List.md#subList(int,int)) is also unmodifiable.

An unmodifiable collection is not necessarily immutable. If the
contained elements are mutable, the entire collection is clearly
mutable, even though it might be unmodifiable. For example, consider
two unmodifiable lists containing mutable elements. The result of calling
`list1.equals(list2)` might differ from one call to the next if
the elements had been mutated, even though both lists are unmodifiable.
However, if an unmodifiable collection contains all immutable elements,
it can be considered effectively immutable.

## Unmodifiable View Collections

An *unmodifiable view collection* is a collection that is unmodifiable
and that is also a view onto a backing collection. Its mutator methods throw
`UnsupportedOperationException`, as described above, while
reading and querying methods are delegated to the backing collection.
The effect is to provide read-only access to the backing collection.
This is useful for a component to provide users with read access to
an internal collection, while preventing them from modifying such
collections unexpectedly. Examples of unmodifiable view collections
are those returned by the
[`Collections.unmodifiableCollection`](Collections.md#unmodifiableCollection(java.util.Collection)),
[`Collections.unmodifiableList`](Collections.md#unmodifiableList(java.util.List)), and
related methods.

Note that changes to the backing collection might still be possible,
and if they occur, they are visible through the unmodifiable view. Thus,
an unmodifiable view collection is not necessarily immutable. However,
if the backing collection of an unmodifiable view is effectively immutable,
or if the only reference to the backing collection is through an
unmodifiable view, the view can be considered effectively immutable.

## Serializability of Collections

Serializability of collections is optional. As such, none of the collections
interfaces are declared to implement the [`Serializable`](../io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io") interface.
However, serializability is regarded as being generally useful, so most collection
implementations are serializable.

The collection implementations that are public classes (such as `ArrayList`
or `HashMap`) are declared to implement the `Serializable` interface if they
are in fact serializable. Some collections implementations are not public classes,
such as the [unmodifiable collections.](#unmodifiable) In such cases, the
serializability of such collections is described in the specification of the method
that creates them, or in some other suitable place. In cases where the serializability
of a collection is not specified, there is no guarantee about the serializability of such
collections. In particular, many [view collections](#view) are not serializable,
even if the original collection is serializable.

A collection implementation that implements the `Serializable` interface cannot
be guaranteed to be serializable. The reason is that in general, collections
contain elements of other types, and it is not possible to determine statically
whether instances of some element type are actually serializable. For example, consider
a serializable `Collection<E>`, where `E` does not implement the
`Serializable` interface. The collection may be serializable, if it contains only
elements of some serializable subtype of `E`, or if it is empty. Collections are
thus said to be *conditionally serializable,* as the serializability of the collection
as a whole depends on whether the collection itself is serializable and on whether all
contained elements are also serializable.

An additional case occurs with instances of [`SortedSet`](SortedSet.md "interface in java.util") and [`SortedMap`](SortedMap.md "interface in java.util").
These collections can be created with a [`Comparator`](Comparator.md "interface in java.util") that imposes an ordering on
the set elements or map keys. Such a collection is serializable only if the provided
`Comparator` is also serializable.

This interface is a member of the
[Java Collections Framework](../../../java.base/java/util/package-summary.md#CollectionsFramework).

  ### Methods inherited from interface java.lang.[Iterable](../lang/Iterable.md "interface in java.lang")

  `forEach`

* ## Method Details

  + ### size

    int size()

    Returns the number of elements in this collection. If this collection
    contains more than `Integer.MAX_VALUE` elements, returns
    `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

    Returns:
    :   the number of elements in this collection
  + ### isEmpty

    boolean isEmpty()

    Returns `true` if this collection contains no elements.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this collection contains no elements
  + ### contains

    boolean contains([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") o)

    Returns `true` if this collection contains the specified element.
    More formally, returns `true` if and only if this collection
    contains at least one element `e` such that
    `Objects.equals(o, e)`.

    Parameters:
    :   `o` - element whose presence in this collection is to be tested

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this collection contains the specified
        element

    Throws:
    :   `ClassCastException` - if the type of the specified element
        is incompatible with this collection
        ([optional](#optional-restrictions))
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified element is null and this
        collection does not permit null elements
        ([optional](#optional-restrictions))
  + ### iterator

    [Iterator](Iterator.md "interface in java.util")<[E](Collection.md "type parameter in Collection")> iterator()

    Returns an iterator over the elements in this collection. There are no
    guarantees concerning the order in which the elements are returned
    (unless this collection is an instance of some class that provides a
    guarantee).

    Specified by:
    :   `iterator` in interface `Iterable<E>`

    Returns:
    :   an `Iterator` over the elements in this collection
  + ### toArray

    [Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")[] toArray()

    Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection.
    If this collection makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
    are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements in
    the same order. The returned array's [runtime component type](../lang/Class.md#getComponentType()) is `Object`.

    The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
    maintained by this collection. (In other words, this method must
    allocate a new array even if this collection is backed by an array).
    The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.

    Returns:
    :   an array, whose [runtime component
        type](../lang/Class.md#getComponentType()) is `Object`, containing all of the elements in this collection
  + ### toArray

    <T> T[] toArray(T[] a)

    Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection;
    the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.
    If the collection fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
    Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the
    specified array and the size of this collection.

    If this collection fits in the specified array with room to spare
    (i.e., the array has more elements than this collection), the element
    in the array immediately following the end of the collection is set to
    `null`. (This is useful in determining the length of this
    collection *only* if the caller knows that this collection does
    not contain any `null` elements.)

    If this collection makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
    are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements in
    the same order.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the component type of the array to contain the collection

    Parameters:
    :   `a` - the array into which the elements of this collection are to be
        stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the same
        runtime type is allocated for this purpose.

    Returns:
    :   an array containing all of the elements in this collection

    Throws:
    :   `ArrayStoreException` - if the runtime type of any element in this
        collection is not assignable to the [runtime component type](../lang/Class.md#getComponentType()) of the specified array
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified array is null
  + ### toArray

    default <T> T[] toArray([IntFunction](function/IntFunction.md "interface in java.util.function")<T[]> generator)

    Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection,
    using the provided `generator` function to allocate the returned array.

    If this collection makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
    are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements in
    the same order.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `T` - the component type of the array to contain the collection

    Parameters:
    :   `generator` - a function which produces a new array of the desired
        type and the provided length

    Returns:
    :   an array containing all of the elements in this collection

    Throws:
    :   `ArrayStoreException` - if the runtime type of any element in this
        collection is not assignable to the [runtime component type](../lang/Class.md#getComponentType()) of the generated array
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the generator function is null

    Since:
    :   11
  + ### add

    boolean add([E](Collection.md "type parameter in Collection") e)

    Ensures that this collection contains the specified element (optional
    operation). Returns `true` if this collection changed as a
    result of the call. (Returns `false` if this collection does
    not permit duplicates and already contains the specified element.)

    Collections that support this operation may place limitations on what
    elements may be added to this collection. In particular, some
    collections will refuse to add `null` elements, and others will
    impose restrictions on the type of elements that may be added.
    Collection classes should clearly specify in their documentation any
    restrictions on what elements may be added.

    If a collection refuses to add a particular element for any reason
    other than that it already contains the element, it *must* throw
    an exception (rather than returning `false`). This preserves
    the invariant that a collection always contains the specified element
    after this call returns.

    Parameters:
    :   `e` - element whose presence in this collection is to be ensured

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this collection changed as a result of the
        call

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the `add` operation
        is not supported by this collection
    :   `ClassCastException` - if the class of the specified element
        prevents it from being added to this collection
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified element is null and this
        collection does not permit null elements
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if some property of the element
        prevents it from being added to this collection
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if the element cannot be added at this
        time due to insertion restrictions
  + ### remove

    boolean remove([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") o)

    Removes a single instance of the specified element from this
    collection, if it is present (optional operation). More formally,
    removes an element `e` such that
    `Objects.equals(o, e)`, if
    this collection contains one or more such elements. Returns
    `true` if this collection contained the specified element (or
    equivalently, if this collection changed as a result of the call).

    Parameters:
    :   `o` - element to be removed from this collection, if present

    Returns:
    :   `true` if an element was removed as a result of this call

    Throws:
    :   `ClassCastException` - if the type of the specified element
        is incompatible with this collection
        ([optional](#optional-restrictions))
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified element is null and this
        collection does not permit null elements
        ([optional](#optional-restrictions))
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the `remove` operation
        is not supported by this collection
  + ### containsAll

    boolean containsAll([Collection](Collection.md "interface in java.util")<?> c)

    Returns `true` if this collection contains all of the elements
    in the specified collection.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - collection to be checked for containment in this collection

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this collection contains all of the elements
        in the specified collection

    Throws:
    :   `ClassCastException` - if the types of one or more elements
        in the specified collection are incompatible with this
        collection
        ([optional](#optional-restrictions))
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified collection contains one
        or more null elements and this collection does not permit null
        elements
        ([optional](#optional-restrictions))
        or if the specified collection is null.

    See Also:
    :   - [`contains(Object)`](#contains(java.lang.Object))
  + ### addAll

    boolean addAll([Collection](Collection.md "interface in java.util")<? extends [E](Collection.md "type parameter in Collection")> c)

    Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this collection
    (optional operation). The behavior of this operation is undefined if
    the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress.
    (This implies that the behavior of this call is undefined if the
    specified collection is this collection, and this collection is
    nonempty.) If the specified collection has a defined
    [encounter order](SequencedCollection.md#encounter),
    processing of its elements generally occurs in that order.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - collection containing elements to be added to this collection

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this collection changed as a result of the call

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the `addAll` operation
        is not supported by this collection
    :   `ClassCastException` - if the class of an element of the specified
        collection prevents it from being added to this collection
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified collection contains a
        null element and this collection does not permit null elements,
        or if the specified collection is null
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if some property of an element of the
        specified collection prevents it from being added to this
        collection
    :   `IllegalStateException` - if not all the elements can be added at
        this time due to insertion restrictions

    See Also:
    :   - [`add(Object)`](#add(E))
  + ### removeAll

    boolean removeAll([Collection](Collection.md "interface in java.util")<?> c)

    Removes all of this collection's elements that are also contained in the
    specified collection (optional operation). After this call returns,
    this collection will contain no elements in common with the specified
    collection.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - collection containing elements to be removed from this collection

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this collection changed as a result of the
        call

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the `removeAll` method
        is not supported by this collection
    :   `ClassCastException` - if the types of one or more elements
        in this collection are incompatible with the specified
        collection
        ([optional](#optional-restrictions))
    :   `NullPointerException` - if this collection contains one or more
        null elements and the specified collection does not support
        null elements
        ([optional](#optional-restrictions))
        or if the specified collection is null

    See Also:
    :   - [`remove(Object)`](#remove(java.lang.Object))
        - [`contains(Object)`](#contains(java.lang.Object))
  + ### removeIf

    default boolean removeIf([Predicate](function/Predicate.md "interface in java.util.function")<? super [E](Collection.md "type parameter in Collection")> filter)

    Removes all of the elements of this collection that satisfy the given
    predicate. Errors or runtime exceptions thrown during iteration or by
    the predicate are relayed to the caller.

    Parameters:
    :   `filter` - a predicate which returns `true` for elements to be
        removed

    Returns:
    :   `true` if any elements were removed

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified filter is null
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if elements cannot be removed
        from this collection. Implementations may throw this exception if a
        matching element cannot be removed or if, in general, removal is not
        supported.

    Since:
    :   1.8
  + ### retainAll

    boolean retainAll([Collection](Collection.md "interface in java.util")<?> c)

    Retains only the elements in this collection that are contained in the
    specified collection (optional operation). In other words, removes from
    this collection all of its elements that are not contained in the
    specified collection.

    Parameters:
    :   `c` - collection containing elements to be retained in this collection

    Returns:
    :   `true` if this collection changed as a result of the call

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the `retainAll` operation
        is not supported by this collection
    :   `ClassCastException` - if the types of one or more elements
        in this collection are incompatible with the specified
        collection
        ([optional](#optional-restrictions))
    :   `NullPointerException` - if this collection contains one or more
        null elements and the specified collection does not permit null
        elements
        ([optional](#optional-restrictions))
        or if the specified collection is null

  + ### clear

    void clear()

    Removes all of the elements from this collection (optional operation).
    The collection will be empty after this method returns.

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the `clear` operation
        is not supported by this collection
  + ### equals

    boolean equals([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") o)

    Compares the specified object with this collection for equality.

    While the `Collection` interface adds no stipulations to the
    general contract for the `Object.equals`, programmers who
    implement the `Collection` interface "directly" (in other words,
    create a class that is a `Collection` but is not a `Set`
    or a `List`) must exercise care if they choose to override the
    `Object.equals`. It is not necessary to do so, and the simplest
    course of action is to rely on `Object`'s implementation, but
    the implementor may wish to implement a "value comparison" in place of
    the default "reference comparison." (The `List` and
    `Set` interfaces mandate such value comparisons.)

    The general contract for the `Object.equals` method states that
    equals must be symmetric (in other words, `a.equals(b)` if and
    only if `b.equals(a)`). The contracts for `List.equals`
    and `Set.equals` state that lists are only equal to other lists,
    and sets to other sets. Thus, a custom `equals` method for a
    collection class that implements neither the `List` nor
    `Set` interface must return `false` when this collection
    is compared to any list or set. (By the same logic, it is not possible
    to write a class that correctly implements both the `Set` and
    `List` interfaces.)

    Overrides:
    :   `equals` in class `Object`

    Parameters:
    :   `o` - object to be compared for equality with this collection

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the specified object is equal to this
        collection

    :   - [`Object.equals(Object)`](../lang/Object.md#equals(java.lang.Object))
        - [`Set.equals(Object)`](Set.md#equals(java.lang.Object))
        - [`List.equals(Object)`](List.md#equals(java.lang.Object))
  + ### hashCode

    int hashCode()

    Returns the hash code value for this collection. While the
    `Collection` interface adds no stipulations to the general
    contract for the `Object.hashCode` method, programmers should
    take note that any class that overrides the `Object.equals`
    method must also override the `Object.hashCode` method in order
    to satisfy the general contract for the `Object.hashCode` method.
    In particular, `c1.equals(c2)` implies that
    `c1.hashCode()==c2.hashCode()`.

    Overrides:
    :   `hashCode` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   the hash code value for this collection

    See Also:
    :   - [`Object.hashCode()`](../lang/Object.md#hashCode())
        - [`Object.equals(Object)`](../lang/Object.md#equals(java.lang.Object))
  + ### spliterator

    default [Spliterator](Spliterator.md "interface in java.util")<[E](Collection.md "type parameter in Collection")> spliterator()

    Creates a [`Spliterator`](Spliterator.md "interface in java.util") over the elements in this collection.
    Implementations should document characteristic values reported by the
    spliterator. Such characteristic values are not required to be reported
    if the spliterator reports [`Spliterator.SIZED`](Spliterator.md#SIZED) and this collection
    contains no elements.

    The default implementation should be overridden by subclasses that
    can return a more efficient spliterator. In order to
    preserve expected laziness behavior for the [`stream()`](#stream()) and
    [`parallelStream()`](#parallelStream()) methods, spliterators should either have the
    characteristic of `IMMUTABLE` or `CONCURRENT`, or be
    *[late-binding](Spliterator.md#binding)*.
    If none of these is practical, the overriding class should describe the
    spliterator's documented policy of binding and structural interference,
    and should override the [`stream()`](#stream()) and [`parallelStream()`](#parallelStream())
    methods to create streams using a `Supplier` of the spliterator,
    as in:

    ```
         Stream<E> s = StreamSupport.stream(() -> spliterator(), spliteratorCharacteristics)
    ```

    These requirements ensure that streams produced by the
    [`stream()`](#stream()) and [`parallelStream()`](#parallelStream()) methods will reflect the
    contents of the collection as of initiation of the terminal stream
    operation.

    Specified by:
    :   `spliterator` in interface `Iterable<E>`

    Returns:
    :   a `Spliterator` over the elements in this collection

    Since:
    :   1.8
  + ### stream

    default [Stream](stream/Stream.md "interface in java.util.stream")<[E](Collection.md "type parameter in Collection")> stream()

    Returns a sequential `Stream` with this collection as its source.

    This method should be overridden when the [`spliterator()`](#spliterator())
    method cannot return a spliterator that is `IMMUTABLE`,
    `CONCURRENT`, or *late-binding*. (See [`spliterator()`](#spliterator())
    for details.)

    Returns:
    :   a sequential `Stream` over the elements in this collection

    Since:
    :   1.8
  + ### parallelStream

    default [Stream](stream/Stream.md "interface in java.util.stream")<[E](Collection.md "type parameter in Collection")> parallelStream()

    Returns a possibly parallel `Stream` with this collection as its
    source. It is allowable for this method to return a sequential stream.

    This method should be overridden when the [`spliterator()`](#spliterator())
    method cannot return a spliterator that is `IMMUTABLE`,
    `CONCURRENT`, or *late-binding*. (See [`spliterator()`](#spliterator())
    for details.)

    Returns:
    :   a possibly parallel `Stream` over the elements in this
        collection

    Since:
    :   1.8
