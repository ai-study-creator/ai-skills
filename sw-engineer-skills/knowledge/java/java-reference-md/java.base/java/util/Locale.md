A `Locale` object represents a specific geographical, political,
or cultural region. An operation that requires a `Locale` to perform
its task is called *locale-sensitive* and uses the `Locale`
to tailor information for the user. For example, displaying a number
is a locale-sensitive operation— the number should be formatted
according to the customs and conventions of the user's native country,
region, or culture.

The `Locale` class implements IETF BCP 47 which is composed of
[RFC 4647 "Matching of Language
Tags"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4647) and [RFC 5646 "Tags
for Identifying Languages"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646) with support for the LDML (UTS#35, "Unicode
Locale Data Markup Language") BCP 47-compatible extensions for locale data
exchange.

A `Locale` object logically consists of the fields
described below.

**language**
:   ISO 639 alpha-2 or alpha-3 language code, or registered
    language subtags up to 8 alpha letters (for future enhancements).
    When a language has both an alpha-2 code and an alpha-3 code, the
    alpha-2 code must be used. You can find a full list of valid
    language codes in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for
    "Type: language"). The language field is case insensitive, but
    `Locale` always canonicalizes to lower case.
:   Well-formed language values have the form
    `[a-zA-Z]{2,8}`. Note that this is not the full
    BCP47 language production, since it excludes extlang. They are
    not needed since modern three-letter language codes replace
    them.
:   Example: "en" (English), "ja" (Japanese), "kok" (Konkani)

**script**
:   ISO 15924 alpha-4 script code. You can find a full list of
    valid script codes in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search
    for "Type: script"). The script field is case insensitive, but
    `Locale` always canonicalizes to title case (the first
    letter is upper case and the rest of the letters are lower
    case).
:   Well-formed script values have the form
    `[a-zA-Z]{4}`
:   Example: "Latn" (Latin), "Cyrl" (Cyrillic)

**country (region)**
:   ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code or UN M.49 numeric-3 area code.
    You can find a full list of valid country and region codes in the
    IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: region"). The
    country (region) field is case insensitive, but
    `Locale` always canonicalizes to upper case.
:   Well-formed country/region values have
    the form `[a-zA-Z]{2} | [0-9]{3}`
:   Example: "US" (United States), "FR" (France), "029"
    (Caribbean)

**variant**
:   Any arbitrary value used to indicate a variation of a
    `Locale`. Where there are two or more variant values
    each indicating its own semantics, these values should be ordered
    by importance, with most important first, separated by
    underscore('\_'). The variant field is case sensitive.
:   Note: IETF BCP 47 places syntactic restrictions on variant
    subtags. Also BCP 47 subtags are strictly used to indicate
    additional variations that define a language or its dialects that
    are not covered by any combinations of language, script and
    region subtags. You can find a full list of valid variant codes
    in the IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: variant").

    However, the variant field in `Locale` has
    historically been used for any kind of variation, not just
    language variations. For example, some supported variants
    available in Java SE Runtime Environments indicate alternative
    cultural behaviors such as calendar type or number script. In
    BCP 47 this kind of information, which does not identify the
    language, is supported by extension subtags or private use
    subtags.
:   Well-formed variant values have the form `SUBTAG
    (('_'|'-') SUBTAG)*` where `SUBTAG =
    [0-9][0-9a-zA-Z]{3} | [0-9a-zA-Z]{5,8}`. (Note: BCP 47 only
    uses hyphen ('-') as a delimiter, this is more lenient).
:   Example: "polyton" (Polytonic Greek), "POSIX"

**extensions**
:   A map from single character keys to string values, indicating
    extensions apart from language identification. The extensions in
    `Locale` implement the semantics and syntax of BCP 47
    extension subtags and private use subtags. The extensions are
    case insensitive, but `Locale` canonicalizes all
    extension keys and values to lower case. Note that extensions
    cannot have empty values.
:   Well-formed keys are single characters from the set
    `[0-9a-zA-Z]`. Well-formed values have the form
    `SUBTAG ('-' SUBTAG)*` where for the key 'x'
    `SUBTAG = [0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}` and for other keys
    `SUBTAG = [0-9a-zA-Z]{2,8}` (that is, 'x' allows
    single-character subtags).
:   Example: key="u"/value="ca-japanese" (Japanese Calendar),
    key="x"/value="java-1-7"

**Note:** Although BCP 47 requires field values to be registered
in the IANA Language Subtag Registry, the `Locale` class
does not provide any validation features. The `Builder`
only checks if an individual field satisfies the syntactic
requirement (is well-formed), but does not validate the value
itself. See [`Locale.Builder`](Locale.Builder.md "class in java.util") for details.

## Unicode locale/language extension

UTS#35, "Unicode Locale Data Markup Language" defines optional
attributes and keywords to override or refine the default behavior
associated with a locale. A keyword is represented by a pair of
key and type. For example, "nu-thai" indicates that Thai local
digits (value:"thai") should be used for formatting numbers
(key:"nu").

The keywords are mapped to a BCP 47 extension value using the
extension key 'u' ([`UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION`](#UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION)). The above
example, "nu-thai", becomes the extension "u-nu-thai".

Thus, when a `Locale` object contains Unicode locale
attributes and keywords,
`getExtension(UNICODE_LOCALE_EXTENSION)` will return a
String representing this information, for example, "nu-thai". The
`Locale` class also provides [`getUnicodeLocaleAttributes()`](#getUnicodeLocaleAttributes()), [`getUnicodeLocaleKeys()`](#getUnicodeLocaleKeys()), and
[`getUnicodeLocaleType(java.lang.String)`](#getUnicodeLocaleType(java.lang.String)) which allow you to access Unicode
locale attributes and key/type pairs directly. When represented as
a string, the Unicode Locale Extension lists attributes
alphabetically, followed by key/type sequences with keys listed
alphabetically (the order of subtags comprising a key's type is
fixed when the type is defined)

A well-formed locale key has the form
`[0-9a-zA-Z]{2}`. A well-formed locale type has the
form `"" | [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8} ('-' [0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8})*` (it
can be empty, or a series of subtags 3-8 alphanums in length). A
well-formed locale attribute has the form
`[0-9a-zA-Z]{3,8}` (it is a single subtag with the same
form as a locale type subtag).

The Unicode locale extension specifies optional behavior in
locale-sensitive services. Although the LDML specification defines
various keys and values, actual locale-sensitive service
implementations in a Java Runtime Environment might not support any
particular Unicode locale attributes or key/type pairs.

### Obtaining a Locale

There are several ways to obtain a `Locale`
object.

#### Builder

Using [`Locale.Builder`](Locale.Builder.md "class in java.util") you can construct a `Locale` object
that conforms to BCP 47 syntax.

#### Factory Methods

The method [`forLanguageTag(java.lang.String)`](#forLanguageTag(java.lang.String)) obtains a `Locale`
object for a well-formed BCP 47 language tag. The method
[`of(String, String, String)`](#of(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String)) and its overloads obtain a
`Locale` object from given `language`, `country`,
and/or `variant` defined above.

#### Locale Constants

The `Locale` class provides a number of convenient constants
that you can use to obtain `Locale` objects for commonly used
locales. For example, `Locale.US` is the `Locale` object
for the United States.

### Locale Matching

If an application or a system is internationalized and provides localized
resources for multiple locales, it sometimes needs to find one or more
locales (or language tags) which meet each user's specific preferences. Note
that a term "language tag" is used interchangeably with "locale" in this
locale matching documentation.

In order to do matching a user's preferred locales to a set of language
tags, [RFC 4647 Matching of
Language Tags](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4647) defines two mechanisms: filtering and lookup.
*Filtering* is used to get all matching locales, whereas
*lookup* is to choose the best matching locale.
Matching is done case-insensitively. These matching mechanisms are described
in the following sections.

A user's preference is called a *Language Priority List* and is
expressed as a list of language ranges. There are syntactically two types of
language ranges: basic and extended. See
[`Locale.LanguageRange`](Locale.LanguageRange.md "class in java.util") for details.

#### Filtering

The filtering operation returns all matching language tags. It is defined
in RFC 4647 as follows:
"In filtering, each language range represents the least specific language
tag (that is, the language tag with fewest number of subtags) that is an
acceptable match. All of the language tags in the matching set of tags will
have an equal or greater number of subtags than the language range. Every
non-wildcard subtag in the language range will appear in every one of the
matching language tags."

There are two types of filtering: filtering for basic language ranges
(called "basic filtering") and filtering for extended language ranges
(called "extended filtering"). They may return different results by what
kind of language ranges are included in the given Language Priority List.
[`Locale.FilteringMode`](Locale.FilteringMode.md "enum class in java.util") is a parameter to specify how filtering should
be done.

#### Lookup

The lookup operation returns the best matching language tags. It is
defined in RFC 4647 as follows:
"By contrast with filtering, each language range represents the most
specific tag that is an acceptable match. The first matching tag found,
according to the user's priority, is considered the closest match and is the
item returned."

For example, if a Language Priority List consists of two language ranges,
`"zh-Hant-TW"` and `"en-US"`, in prioritized order, lookup
method progressively searches the language tags below in order to find the
best matching language tag.
> ```
>     1. zh-Hant-TW
>     2. zh-Hant
>     3. zh
>     4. en-US
>     5. en
> ```

If there is a language tag which matches completely to a language range
above, the language tag is returned.

`"*"` is the special language range, and it is ignored in lookup.

If multiple language tags match as a result of the subtag `'*'`
included in a language range, the first matching language tag returned by
an [`Iterator`](Iterator.md "interface in java.util") over a [`Collection`](Collection.md "interface in java.util") of language tags is treated as
the best matching one.

### Use of Locale

Once you've obtained a `Locale` you can query it for information
about itself. Use `getCountry` to get the country (or region)
code and `getLanguage` to get the language code.
You can use `getDisplayCountry` to get the
name of the country suitable for displaying to the user. Similarly,
you can use `getDisplayLanguage` to get the name of
the language suitable for displaying to the user. Interestingly,
the `getDisplayXXX` methods are themselves locale-sensitive
and have two versions: one that uses the default
[`DISPLAY`](Locale.Category.md#DISPLAY) locale and one
that uses the locale specified as an argument.

The Java Platform provides a number of classes that perform locale-sensitive
operations. For example, the `NumberFormat` class formats
numbers, currency, and percentages in a locale-sensitive manner. Classes
such as `NumberFormat` have several convenience methods
for creating a default object of that type. For example, the
`NumberFormat` class provides these three convenience methods
for creating a default `NumberFormat` object:

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

```
    NumberFormat.getInstance();
    NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance();
    NumberFormat.getPercentInstance();
```

Each of these methods has two variants; one with an explicit locale
and one without; the latter uses the default
[`FORMAT`](Locale.Category.md#FORMAT) locale:

Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

```
    NumberFormat.getInstance(myLocale);
    NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(myLocale);
    NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(myLocale);
```

A `Locale` is the mechanism for identifying the kind of object
(`NumberFormat`) that you would like to get. The locale is
**just** a mechanism for identifying objects,
**not** a container for the objects themselves.

### Compatibility

In order to maintain compatibility, Locale's
constructors retain their behavior prior to the Java Runtime
Environment version 1.7. The same is largely true for the
`toString` method. Thus Locale objects can continue to
be used as they were. In particular, clients who parse the output
of toString into language, country, and variant fields can continue
to do so (although this is strongly discouraged), although the
variant field will have additional information in it if script or
extensions are present.

In addition, BCP 47 imposes syntax restrictions that are not
imposed by Locale's constructors. This means that conversions
between some Locales and BCP 47 language tags cannot be made without
losing information. Thus `toLanguageTag` cannot
represent the state of locales whose language, country, or variant
do not conform to BCP 47.

Because of these issues, it is recommended that clients migrate
away from constructing non-conforming locales and use the
`forLanguageTag` and `Locale.Builder` APIs instead.
Clients desiring a string representation of the complete locale can
then always rely on `toLanguageTag` for this purpose.

#### Special cases

For compatibility reasons, two
non-conforming locales are treated as special cases. These are
**`ja_JP_JP`** and **`th_TH_TH`**. These are ill-formed
in BCP 47 since the variants are too short. To ease migration to BCP 47,
these are treated specially during construction. These two cases (and only
these) cause a constructor to generate an extension, all other values behave
exactly as they did prior to Java 7.

Java has used `ja_JP_JP` to represent Japanese as used in
Japan together with the Japanese Imperial calendar. This is now
representable using a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the
Unicode locale key `ca` (for "calendar") and type
`japanese`. When the Locale constructor is called with the
arguments "ja", "JP", "JP", the extension "u-ca-japanese" is
automatically added.

Java has used `th_TH_TH` to represent Thai as used in
Thailand together with Thai digits. This is also now representable using
a Unicode locale extension, by specifying the Unicode locale key
`nu` (for "number") and value `thai`. When the Locale
constructor is called with the arguments "th", "TH", "TH", the
extension "u-nu-thai" is automatically added.

#### Serialization

During serialization, writeObject writes all fields to the output
stream, including extensions.

During deserialization, readResolve adds extensions as described
in [Special Cases](#special_cases_constructor), only
for the two cases th\_TH\_TH and ja\_JP\_JP.

#### Legacy language codes

Locale's constructor has always converted three language codes to
their earlier, obsoleted forms: `he` maps to `iw`,
`yi` maps to `ji`, and `id` maps to
`in`. Since Java SE 17, this is no longer the case. Each
language maps to its new form; `iw` maps to `he`, `ji`
maps to `yi`, and `in` maps to `id`.

For the backward compatible behavior, the system property
`java.locale.useOldISOCodes` reverts the behavior
back to that of before Java SE 17. If the system property is set to
`true`, those three current language codes are mapped to their
backward compatible forms. The property is only read at Java runtime
startup and subsequent calls to `System.setProperty()` will
have no effect.

The APIs added in 1.7 map between the old and new language codes,
maintaining the mapped codes internal to Locale (so that
`getLanguage` and `toString` reflect the mapped
code, which depends on the `java.locale.useOldISOCodes` system
property), but using the new codes in the BCP 47 language tag APIs (so
that `toLanguageTag` reflects the new one). This
preserves the equivalence between Locales no matter which code or
API is used to construct them. Java's default resource bundle
lookup mechanism also implements this mapping, so that resources
can be named using either convention, see [`ResourceBundle.Control`](ResourceBundle.Control.md "class in java.util").

#### Three-letter language/country(region) codes

The Locale constructors have always specified that the language
and the country param be two characters in length, although in
practice they have accepted any length. The specification has now
been relaxed to allow language codes of two to eight characters and
country (region) codes of two to three characters, and in
particular, three-letter language codes and three-digit region
codes as specified in the IANA Language Subtag Registry. For
compatibility, the implementation still does not impose a length
constraint.

  + ### getDefault

    public static [Locale](Locale.md "class in java.util") getDefault()

    Gets the current value of the default locale for this instance
    of the Java Virtual Machine.

    The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup
    based on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive
    methods if no locale is explicitly specified.
    It can be changed using the
    [`setDefault`](#setDefault(java.util.Locale)) method.

    Returns:
    :   the default locale for this instance of the Java Virtual Machine
  + ### getDefault

    public static [Locale](Locale.md "class in java.util") getDefault([Locale.Category](Locale.Category.md "enum class in java.util") category)

    Gets the current value of the default locale for the specified Category
    for this instance of the Java Virtual Machine.

    The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup based
    on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive methods
    if no locale is explicitly specified. It can be changed using the
    setDefault(Locale.Category, Locale) method.

    Parameters:
    :   `category` - the specified category to get the default locale

    Returns:
    :   the default locale for the specified Category for this instance
        of the Java Virtual Machine

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if category is null

    :   - [`setDefault(Locale.Category, Locale)`](#setDefault(java.util.Locale.Category,java.util.Locale))
  + ### setDefault

    public static void setDefault([Locale](Locale.md "class in java.util") newLocale)

    Sets the default locale for this instance of the Java Virtual Machine.
    This does not affect the host locale.

    If there is a security manager, its `checkPermission`
    method is called with a `PropertyPermission("user.language", "write")`
    permission before the default locale is changed.

    The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup
    based on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive
    methods if no locale is explicitly specified.

    Since changing the default locale may affect many different areas
    of functionality, this method should only be used if the caller
    is prepared to reinitialize locale-sensitive code running
    within the same Java Virtual Machine.

    By setting the default locale with this method, all of the default
    locales for each Category are also set to the specified default locale.

    Parameters:
    :   `newLocale` - the new default locale

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its
        `checkPermission` method doesn't allow the operation.
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `newLocale` is null

  + ### setDefault

    public static void setDefault([Locale.Category](Locale.Category.md "enum class in java.util") category,
    [Locale](Locale.md "class in java.util") newLocale)

    Sets the default locale for the specified Category for this instance
    of the Java Virtual Machine. This does not affect the host locale.

    If there is a security manager, its checkPermission method is called
    with a PropertyPermission("user.language", "write") permission before
    the default locale is changed.

    The Java Virtual Machine sets the default locale during startup based
    on the host environment. It is used by many locale-sensitive methods
    if no locale is explicitly specified.

    Since changing the default locale may affect many different areas of
    functionality, this method should only be used if the caller is
    prepared to reinitialize locale-sensitive code running within the
    same Java Virtual Machine.

    Parameters:
    :   `category` - the specified category to set the default locale
    :   `newLocale` - the new default locale

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its
        checkPermission method doesn't allow the operation.
    :   `NullPointerException` - if category and/or newLocale is null

  + ### getAvailableLocales

    public static [Locale](Locale.md "class in java.util")[] getAvailableLocales()

    Returns an array of installed locales.
    The returned array represents the union of locales supported
    by the Java runtime environment and by installed
    [`LocaleServiceProvider`](spi/LocaleServiceProvider.md "class in java.util.spi")
    implementations. At a minimum, the returned array must contain a
    `Locale` instance equal to [`Locale.ROOT`](#ROOT) and
    a `Locale` instance equal to [`Locale.US`](#US).

    Returns:
    :   an array of installed locales
  + ### availableLocales

    public static [Stream](stream/Stream.md "interface in java.util.stream")<[Locale](Locale.md "class in java.util")> availableLocales()

    Returns a stream of installed locales.

    by the Java runtime environment and by installed
    [`LocaleServiceProvider`](spi/LocaleServiceProvider.md "class in java.util.spi")
    implementations. At a minimum, the returned stream must contain a
    `Locale` instance equal to [`Locale.ROOT`](#ROOT) and

  + ### getISOCountries

    public static [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] getISOCountries()

    Returns a list of all 2-letter country codes defined in ISO 3166.
    Can be used to obtain Locales.
    This method is equivalent to [`getISOCountries(Locale.IsoCountryCode type)`](#getISOCountries(java.util.Locale.IsoCountryCode))
    with `type` [`Locale.IsoCountryCode.PART1_ALPHA2`](Locale.IsoCountryCode.md#PART1_ALPHA2).

    **Note:** The `Locale` class also supports other codes for
    country (region), such as 3-letter numeric UN M.49 area codes.
    Therefore, the list returned by this method does not contain ALL valid
    codes that can be used to obtain Locales.

    Note that this method does not return obsolete 2-letter country codes.
    ISO3166-3 codes which designate country codes for those obsolete codes,
    can be retrieved from [`getISOCountries(Locale.IsoCountryCode type)`](#getISOCountries(java.util.Locale.IsoCountryCode)) with
    `type` [`Locale.IsoCountryCode.PART3`](Locale.IsoCountryCode.md#PART3).

    Returns:
    :   An array of ISO 3166 two-letter country codes.
  + ### getISOCountries

    public static [Set](Set.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> getISOCountries([Locale.IsoCountryCode](Locale.IsoCountryCode.md "enum class in java.util") type)

    Returns a `Set` of ISO3166 country codes for the specified type.

    Parameters:
    :   `type` - [`Locale.IsoCountryCode`](Locale.IsoCountryCode.md "enum class in java.util") specified ISO code type.

    Returns:
    :   a `Set` of ISO3166 country codes for the specified type

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if type is null

  + ### getISOLanguages

    public static [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang")[] getISOLanguages()

    Returns a list of all 2-letter language codes defined in ISO 639.
    Can be used to obtain Locales.

    **Note:**
    - ISO 639 is not a stable standard— some languages' codes have changed.
      The list this function returns includes both the new and the old codes for the
      languages whose codes have changed.- The `Locale` class also supports language codes up to
        8 characters in length. Therefore, the list returned by this method does
        not contain ALL valid codes that can be used to obtain Locales.

    Returns:
    :   An array of ISO 639 two-letter language codes.
  + ### getLanguage

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getLanguage()

    Returns the language code of this Locale.

  + ### getScript

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getScript()

    Returns the script for this locale, which should
    either be the empty string or an ISO 15924 4-letter script
    code. The first letter is uppercase and the rest are
    lowercase, for example, 'Latn', 'Cyrl'.

    Returns:
    :   The script code, or the empty string if none is defined.

    Since:
    :   1.7

  + ### getExtension

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getExtension(char key)

    Returns the extension (or private use) value associated with
    the specified key, or null if there is no extension
    associated with the key. To be well-formed, the key must be one
    of `[0-9A-Za-z]`. Keys are case-insensitive, so
    for example 'z' and 'Z' represent the same extension.

    Parameters:
    :   `key` - the extension key

    Returns:
    :   The extension, or null if this locale defines no
        extension for the specified key.

    Returns the set of unicode locale attributes associated with
    this locale, or the empty set if it has no attributes. The
    returned set is unmodifiable.

    Returns:
    :   The set of attributes.

    Since:
    :   1.7
  + ### getUnicodeLocaleType

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getUnicodeLocaleType([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") key)

    Returns the Unicode locale type associated with the specified Unicode locale key
    for this locale. Returns the empty string for keys that are defined with no type.
    Returns null if the key is not defined. Keys are case-insensitive. The key must
    be two alphanumeric characters ([0-9a-zA-Z]), or an IllegalArgumentException is
    thrown.

    Parameters:
    :   `key` - the Unicode locale key

    Returns:
    :   The Unicode locale type associated with the key, or null if the
        locale does not define the key.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the key is not well-formed
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `key` is null

    Since:
    :   1.7
  + ### getUnicodeLocaleKeys

    public [Set](Set.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> getUnicodeLocaleKeys()

    Returns the set of Unicode locale keys defined by this locale, or the empty set if
    this locale has none. The returned set is immutable. Keys are all lower case.

    Returns:
    :   The set of Unicode locale keys, or the empty set if this locale has
        no Unicode locale keywords.

    Since:
    :   1.7
  + ### toString

    public final [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Returns a string representation of this `Locale`
    object, consisting of language, country, variant, script,
    and extensions as below:
    > language + "\_" + country + "\_" + (variant + "\_#" | "#") + script + "\_" + extensions

    Language is always lower case, country is always upper case, script is always title
    case, and extensions are always lower case. Extensions and private use subtags
    will be in canonical order as explained in [`toLanguageTag()`](#toLanguageTag()).

    When the locale has neither script nor extensions, the result is the same as in
    Java 6 and prior.

    If both the language and country fields are missing, this function will return
    the empty string, even if the variant, script, or extensions field is present (you
    can't have a locale with just a variant, the variant must accompany a well-formed
    language or country code).

    If script or extensions are present and variant is missing, no underscore is
    added before the "#".

    This behavior is designed to support debugging and to be compatible with
    previous uses of `toString` that expected language, country, and variant
    fields only. To represent a Locale as a String for interchange purposes, use
    [`toLanguageTag()`](#toLanguageTag()).

    Examples:
    - `en`
    - `de_DE`
    - `_GB`
    - `en_US_WIN`
    - `de__POSIX`
    - `zh_CN_#Hans`
    - `zh_TW_#Hant_x-java`
    - `th_TH_TH_#u-nu-thai`

    Overrides:

    Returns:

  + ### toLanguageTag

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toLanguageTag()

    Returns a well-formed IETF BCP 47 language tag representing
    this locale.

    If this `Locale` has a language, country, or
    variant that does not satisfy the IETF BCP 47 language tag
    syntax requirements, this method handles these fields as
    described below:

    **Language:** If language is empty, or not
    [well-formed](#def_language) (for example "a" or
    "e2"), it will be emitted as "und" (Undetermined).

    **Country:** If country is not [well-formed](#def_region)
    (for example "12" or "USA"), it will be omitted.

    **Variant:** If variant **is** [well-formed](#def_variant), each sub-segment
    (delimited by '-' or '\_') is emitted as a subtag. Otherwise:
    - if all sub-segments match `[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}`
      (for example "WIN" or "Oracle\_JDK\_Standard\_Edition"), the first
      ill-formed sub-segment and all following will be appended to
      the private use subtag. The first appended subtag will be
      "lvariant", followed by the sub-segments in order, separated by
      hyphen. For example, "x-lvariant-WIN",
      "Oracle-x-lvariant-JDK-Standard-Edition".- if any sub-segment does not match
        `[0-9a-zA-Z]{1,8}`, the variant will be truncated
        and the problematic sub-segment and all following sub-segments
        will be omitted. If the remainder is non-empty, it will be
        emitted as a private use subtag as above (even if the remainder
        turns out to be well-formed). For example,
        "Solaris\_isjustthecoolestthing" is emitted as
        "x-lvariant-Solaris", not as "solaris".

    **Special Conversions:** Java supports some old locale
    representations, including deprecated ISO language codes,
    for compatibility. This method performs the following
    conversions:
    - Deprecated ISO language codes "iw", "ji", and "in" are
      converted to "he", "yi", and "id", respectively.- A locale with language "no", country "NO", and variant
        "NY", representing Norwegian Nynorsk (Norway), is converted
        to a language tag "nn-NO".

    **Note:** Although the language tag obtained by this
    method is well-formed (satisfies the syntax requirements
    defined by the IETF BCP 47 specification), it is not
    necessarily a valid BCP 47 language tag. For example,

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
      Locale.forLanguageTag("xx-YY").toLanguageTag();
    ```

    will return "xx-YY", but the language subtag "xx" and the
    region subtag "YY" are invalid because they are not registered
    in the IANA Language Subtag Registry.

    Returns:
    :   a BCP47 language tag representing the locale

    Since:
    :   1.7

  + ### caseFoldLanguageTag

    public static [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") caseFoldLanguageTag([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") languageTag)

    Returns a case folded IETF BCP 47 language tag.

    This method formats a language tag into one with case convention
    that adheres to section 2.1.1. Formatting of Language Tags of RFC5646.
    This format is defined as: *All subtags, including extension and private
    use subtags, use lowercase letters with two exceptions: two-letter
    and four-letter subtags that neither appear at the start of the tag
    nor occur after singletons. Such two-letter subtags are all
    uppercase (as in the tags "en-CA-x-ca" or "sgn-BE-FR") and four-
    letter subtags are titlecase (as in the tag "az-Latn-x-latn").* As
    legacy tags, (defined as "grandfathered" in RFC5646) are not always well-formed, this method
    will simply case fold a legacy tag to match the exact case convention
    for the particular tag specified in the respective
    [`Legacy tags`](#legacy_tags) table.

    **Special Exceptions**

    To maintain consistency with [`variant`](#def_variant)
    which is case-sensitive, this method will neither case fold variant
    subtags nor case fold private use subtags prefixed by `lvariant`.

    For example,

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
    String tag = "ja-kana-jp-x-lvariant-Oracle-JDK-Standard-Edition";
    Locale.caseFoldLanguageTag(tag); // returns "ja-Kana-JP-x-lvariant-Oracle-JDK-Standard-Edition"
    String tag2 = "ja-kana-jp-x-Oracle-JDK-Standard-Edition";
    Locale.caseFoldLanguageTag(tag2); // returns "ja-Kana-JP-x-oracle-jdk-standard-edition"
    ```

    Excluding case folding, this method makes no modifications to the tag itself.
    Case convention of language tags does not carry meaning, and is simply
    recommended as it corresponds with various ISO standards, including:
    ISO639-1, ISO15924, and ISO3166-1.

    As the formatting of the case convention is dependent on the
    positioning of certain subtags, callers of this method should ensure
    that the language tag is well-formed, (conforming to section 2.1. Syntax
    of RFC5646).

    Parameters:
    :   `languageTag` - the IETF BCP 47 language tag.

    Returns:
    :   a case folded IETF BCP 47 language tag

    Throws:
    :   `IllformedLocaleException` - if `languageTag` is not well-formed
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `languageTag` is `null`

    Since:
    :   21

  + ### forLanguageTag

    public static [Locale](Locale.md "class in java.util") forLanguageTag([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") languageTag)

    Returns a locale for the specified IETF BCP 47 language tag string.

    If the specified language tag contains any ill-formed subtags,
    the first such subtag and all following subtags are ignored. Compare
    to [`Locale.Builder.setLanguageTag(java.lang.String)`](Locale.Builder.md#setLanguageTag(java.lang.String)) which throws an exception
    in this case.

    The following **conversions** are performed:
    - The language code "und" is mapped to language "".- The language codes "iw", "ji", and "in" are mapped to "he",
        "yi", and "id" respectively. (This is the same canonicalization
        that's done in Locale's constructors.) See
        [Legacy language codes](#legacy_language_codes)
        for more information.- The portion of a private use subtag prefixed by "lvariant",
          if any, is removed and appended to the variant field in the
          result locale (without case normalization). If it is then
          empty, the private use subtag is discarded:

          Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

          ```
              Locale loc;
              loc = Locale.forLanguageTag("en-US-x-lvariant-POSIX");
              loc.getVariant(); // returns "POSIX"
              loc.getExtension('x'); // returns null

              loc = Locale.forLanguageTag("de-POSIX-x-URP-lvariant-Abc-Def");
              loc.getVariant(); // returns "POSIX_Abc_Def"
              loc.getExtension('x'); // returns "urp"
          ```

          - When the languageTag argument contains an extlang subtag,
            the first such subtag is used as the language, and the primary
            language subtag and other extlang subtags are ignored:

            Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

            ```
                Locale.forLanguageTag("ar-aao").getLanguage(); // returns "aao"
                Locale.forLanguageTag("en-abc-def-us").toString(); // returns "abc_US"
            ```

            - Case is normalized except for variant tags, which are left
              unchanged. Language is normalized to lower case, script to
              title case, country to upper case, and extensions to lower
              case.- If, after processing, the locale would exactly match either
                ja\_JP\_JP or th\_TH\_TH with no extensions, the appropriate
                extensions are added as though the constructor had been called:

                Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

                ```
                   Locale.forLanguageTag("ja-JP-x-lvariant-JP").toLanguageTag();
                   // returns "ja-JP-u-ca-japanese-x-lvariant-JP"
                   Locale.forLanguageTag("th-TH-x-lvariant-TH").toLanguageTag();
                   // returns "th-TH-u-nu-thai-x-lvariant-TH"
                ```

    This implements the 'Language-Tag' production of BCP47, and
    so supports legacy (regular and irregular, referred to as
    "Type: grandfathered" in BCP47) as well as
    private use language tags. Stand alone private use tags are
    represented as empty language and extension 'x-whatever',
    and legacy tags are converted to their canonical replacements
    where they exist.

    Legacy tags with canonical replacements are as follows:

    Legacy tags with canonical replacements

    | legacy tag | modern replacement |
    | --- | --- |
    | art-lojban | jbo |
    | i-ami | ami |
    | i-bnn | bnn |
    | i-hak | hak |
    | i-klingon | tlh |

    | zh-guoyu | cmn |
    | zh-hakka | hak |
    | zh-min-nan | nan |
    | zh-xiang | hsn |

    Legacy tags with no modern replacement will be
    converted as follows:

    Legacy tags with no modern replacement

    | legacy tag | converts to |
    | --- | --- |
    | cel-gaulish | xtg-x-cel-gaulish |
    | en-GB-oed | en-GB-x-oed |
    | i-default | en-x-i-default |
    | i-enochian | und-x-i-enochian |
    | i-mingo | see-x-i-mingo |
    | zh-min | nan-x-zh-min |

    For a list of all legacy tags, see the
    IANA Language Subtag Registry (search for "Type: grandfathered").

    **Note**: there is no guarantee that `toLanguageTag`
    and `forLanguageTag` will round-trip.

    Parameters:
    :   `languageTag` - the language tag

    Returns:
    :   The locale that best represents the language tag.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `languageTag` is `null`

  + ### getISO3Language

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getISO3Language()
    throws [MissingResourceException](MissingResourceException.md "class in java.util")

    Returns a three-letter abbreviation of this locale's language.
    If the language matches an ISO 639-1 two-letter code, the
    corresponding ISO 639-2/T three-letter lowercase code is
    returned. The ISO 639-2 language codes can be found on-line,
    see "Codes for the Representation of Names of Languages Part 2:
    Alpha-3 Code". If the locale specifies a three-letter
    language, the language is returned as is. If the locale does
    not specify a language the empty string is returned.

    Returns:
    :   a three-letter abbreviation of this locale's language

    Throws:
    :   `MissingResourceException` - Throws MissingResourceException if
        three-letter language abbreviation is not available for this locale.
  + ### getISO3Country

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getISO3Country()
    throws [MissingResourceException](MissingResourceException.md "class in java.util")

    Returns a three-letter abbreviation of this locale's country.
    If the country matches an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, the
    corresponding ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 uppercase code is returned.
    If the locale doesn't specify a country, this will be the empty
    string.

    The ISO 3166-1 codes can be found on-line.

    Returns:
    :   a three-letter abbreviation of this locale's country

    Throws:
    :   `MissingResourceException` - Throws MissingResourceException if the
        three-letter country abbreviation is not available for this locale.
  + ### getDisplayLanguage

    public final [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getDisplayLanguage()

    Returns a name for the locale's language that is appropriate for display to the
    user.
    If possible, the name returned will be localized for the default
    [`DISPLAY`](Locale.Category.md#DISPLAY) locale.
    For example, if the locale is fr\_FR and the default
    [`DISPLAY`](Locale.Category.md#DISPLAY) locale
    is en\_US, getDisplayLanguage() will return "French"; if the locale is en\_US and
    the default [`DISPLAY`](Locale.Category.md#DISPLAY) locale is fr\_FR,
    getDisplayLanguage() will return "anglais".
    If the name returned cannot be localized for the default
    [`DISPLAY`](Locale.Category.md#DISPLAY) locale,
    (say, we don't have a Japanese name for Croatian),
    this function falls back on the English name, and uses the ISO code as a last-resort
    value. If the locale doesn't specify a language, this function returns the empty string.

    Returns:
    :   The name of the display language.
  + ### getDisplayLanguage

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getDisplayLanguage([Locale](Locale.md "class in java.util") inLocale)

    Returns a name for the locale's language that is appropriate for display to the
    user.
    If possible, the name returned will be localized according to inLocale.
    For example, if the locale is fr\_FR and inLocale
    is en\_US, getDisplayLanguage() will return "French"; if the locale is en\_US and
    inLocale is fr\_FR, getDisplayLanguage() will return "anglais".
    If the name returned cannot be localized according to inLocale,
    (say, we don't have a Japanese name for Croatian),
    this function falls back on the English name, and finally
    on the ISO code as a last-resort value. If the locale doesn't specify a language,
    this function returns the empty string.

    Parameters:
    :   `inLocale` - The locale for which to retrieve the display language.

    Returns:
    :   The name of the display language appropriate to the given locale.

    Throws:

  + ### getDisplayScript

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getDisplayScript()

    Returns a name for the locale's script that is appropriate for display to
    the user. If possible, the name will be localized for the default
    [`DISPLAY`](Locale.Category.md#DISPLAY) locale. Returns
    the empty string if this locale doesn't specify a script code.

    Returns:
    :   the display name of the script code for the current default
        [`DISPLAY`](Locale.Category.md#DISPLAY) locale

    Since:

    localized for the given locale. Returns the empty string if
    this locale doesn't specify a script code.

    Parameters:
    :   `inLocale` - The locale for which to retrieve the display script.

    Returns:
    :   the display name of the script code for the current default
        [`DISPLAY`](Locale.Category.md#DISPLAY) locale

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `inLocale` is `null`

    Since:
    :   1.7
  + ### getDisplayCountry

    public final [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getDisplayCountry()

    Returns a name for the locale's country that is appropriate for display to the
    user.
    If possible, the name returned will be localized for the default
    [`DISPLAY`](Locale.Category.md#DISPLAY) locale.
    For example, if the locale is fr\_FR and the default
    [`DISPLAY`](Locale.Category.md#DISPLAY) locale
    is en\_US, getDisplayCountry() will return "France"; if the locale is en\_US and
    the default [`DISPLAY`](Locale.Category.md#DISPLAY) locale is fr\_FR,
    getDisplayCountry() will return "Etats-Unis".
    If the name returned cannot be localized for the default
    [`DISPLAY`](Locale.Category.md#DISPLAY) locale,
    (say, we don't have a Japanese name for Croatia),
    this function falls back on the English name, and uses the ISO code as a last-resort
    value. If the locale doesn't specify a country, this function returns the empty string.

    Returns:
    :   The name of the country appropriate to the locale.
  + ### getDisplayCountry

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getDisplayCountry([Locale](Locale.md "class in java.util") inLocale)

  + ### getDisplayName

    public final [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getDisplayName()

    Returns a name for the locale that is appropriate for display to the
    user. This will be the values returned by getDisplayLanguage(),
    getDisplayScript(), getDisplayCountry(), getDisplayVariant() and
    optional [Unicode extensions](#def_locale_extension)
    assembled into a single string. The non-empty values are used in order, with
    the second and subsequent names in parentheses. For example:
    > language (script, country, variant(, extension)\*)  
    > language (country(, extension)\*)  
    > language (variant(, extension)\*)  
    > script (country(, extension)\*)  
    > country (extension)\*

    depending on which fields are specified in the locale. The field
    separator in the above parentheses, denoted as a comma character, may
    be localized depending on the locale. If the language, script, country,
    and variant fields are all empty, this function returns the empty string.

    Returns:

    to the user. This will be the values returned by
    getDisplayLanguage(), getDisplayScript(), getDisplayCountry(),
    getDisplayVariant(), and optional [Unicode extensions](#def_locale_extension) assembled into a single string. The non-empty
    values are used in order, with the second and subsequent names in
    parentheses. For example:

  + ### equals

    public boolean equals([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") obj)

    Returns true if this Locale is equal to another object. A Locale is
    deemed equal to another Locale with identical language, script, country,
    variant and extensions, and unequal to all other objects.

    Overrides:
    :   `equals` in class `Object`

    Parameters:

    [Locale.FilteringMode](Locale.FilteringMode.md "enum class in java.util") mode)

    Returns a list of matching `Locale` instances using the filtering
    mechanism defined in RFC 4647.
    This filter operation on the given `locales` ensures that only
    unique matching locale(s) are returned.

    Parameters:
    :   `priorityList` - user's Language Priority List in which each language
        tag is sorted in descending order based on priority or weight
    :   `locales` - `Locale` instances used for matching
    :   `mode` - filtering mode

    Returns:
    :   a list of `Locale` instances for matching language tags
        sorted in descending order based on priority or weight, or an empty
        list if nothing matches. The list is modifiable.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `priorityList` or `locales`
        is `null`
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if one or more extended language ranges

  + ### filter

    public static [List](List.md "interface in java.util")<[Locale](Locale.md "class in java.util")> filter([List](List.md "interface in java.util")<[Locale.LanguageRange](Locale.LanguageRange.md "class in java.util")> priorityList,
    [Collection](Collection.md "interface in java.util")<[Locale](Locale.md "class in java.util")> locales)

    Returns a list of matching `Locale` instances using the filtering
    mechanism defined in RFC 4647. This is equivalent to
    [`filter(List, Collection, FilteringMode)`](#filter(java.util.List,java.util.Collection,java.util.Locale.FilteringMode)) when `mode` is
    [`Locale.FilteringMode.AUTOSELECT_FILTERING`](Locale.FilteringMode.md#AUTOSELECT_FILTERING).
    This filter operation on the given `locales` ensures that only
    unique matching locale(s) are returned.

    Parameters:
    :   `priorityList` - user's Language Priority List in which each language
        tag is sorted in descending order based on priority or weight
    :   `locales` - `Locale` instances used for matching

    Returns:
    :   a list of `Locale` instances for matching language tags
        sorted in descending order based on priority or weight, or an empty
        list if nothing matches. The list is modifiable.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `priorityList` or `locales`
        is `null`

    :   1.8
  + ### filterTags

    public static [List](List.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> filterTags([List](List.md "interface in java.util")<[Locale.LanguageRange](Locale.LanguageRange.md "class in java.util")> priorityList,
    [Collection](Collection.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> tags,
    [Locale.FilteringMode](Locale.FilteringMode.md "enum class in java.util") mode)

    Returns a list of matching languages tags using the basic filtering
    mechanism defined in RFC 4647.
    This filter operation on the given `tags` ensures that only
    unique matching tag(s) are returned with preserved case. In case of
    duplicate matching tags with the case difference, the first matching
    tag with preserved case is returned.
    For example, "de-ch" is returned out of the duplicate matching tags
    "de-ch" and "de-CH", if "de-ch" is checked first for matching in the
    given `tags`. Note that if the given `tags` is an unordered
    `Collection`, the returned matching tag out of duplicate tags is
    subject to change, depending on the implementation of the
    `Collection`.

    Parameters:
    :   `priorityList` - user's Language Priority List in which each language
        tag is sorted in descending order based on priority or weight
    :   `tags` - language tags
    :   `mode` - filtering mode

    Returns:
    :   a list of matching language tags sorted in descending order
        based on priority or weight, or an empty list if nothing matches.
        The list is modifiable.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `priorityList` or `tags` is
        `null`
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if one or more extended language ranges
        are included in the given list when
        [`Locale.FilteringMode.REJECT_EXTENDED_RANGES`](Locale.FilteringMode.md#REJECT_EXTENDED_RANGES) is specified

    [Collection](Collection.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> tags)

    Returns a list of matching languages tags using the basic filtering
    mechanism defined in RFC 4647. This is equivalent to
    [`filterTags(List, Collection, FilteringMode)`](#filterTags(java.util.List,java.util.Collection,java.util.Locale.FilteringMode)) when `mode`
    is [`Locale.FilteringMode.AUTOSELECT_FILTERING`](Locale.FilteringMode.md#AUTOSELECT_FILTERING).
    This filter operation on the given `tags` ensures that only
    unique matching tag(s) are returned with preserved case. In case of
    duplicate matching tags with the case difference, the first matching
    tag with preserved case is returned.
    For example, "de-ch" is returned out of the duplicate matching tags
    "de-ch" and "de-CH", if "de-ch" is checked first for matching in the
    given `tags`. Note that if the given `tags` is an unordered

    `Collection`.

    Parameters:
    :   `priorityList` - user's Language Priority List in which each language
        tag is sorted in descending order based on priority or weight
    :   `tags` - language tags

    Returns:
    :   a list of matching language tags sorted in descending order
        based on priority or weight, or an empty list if nothing matches.

        tag is sorted in descending order based on priority or weight
    :   `locales` - `Locale` instances used for matching

    Returns:
    :   the best matching `Locale` instance chosen based on
        priority or weight, or `null` if nothing matches.

    Returns the best-matching language tag using the lookup mechanism
    defined in RFC 4647.
    This lookup operation on the given `tags` ensures that the
    first matching tag with preserved case is returned.

    Parameters:
    :   `priorityList` - user's Language Priority List in which each language
        tag is sorted in descending order based on priority or weight
    :   `tags` - language tags used for matching

    Returns:
    :   the best matching language tag chosen based on priority or
