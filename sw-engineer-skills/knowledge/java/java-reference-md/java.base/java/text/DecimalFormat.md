public class DecimalFormat
extends [NumberFormat](NumberFormat.md "class in java.text")

`DecimalFormat` is a concrete subclass of
`NumberFormat` that formats decimal numbers. It has a variety of
features designed to make it possible to parse and format numbers in any
locale, including support for Western, Arabic, and Indic digits. It also
supports different kinds of numbers, including integers (123), fixed-point
numbers (123.4), scientific notation (1.23E4), percentages (12%), and
currency amounts ($123). All of these can be localized.

To obtain a `NumberFormat` for a specific locale, including the
default locale, call one of `NumberFormat`'s factory methods, such
as `getInstance()`. In general, do not call the
`DecimalFormat` constructors directly, since the
`NumberFormat` factory methods may return subclasses other than
`DecimalFormat`. If you need to customize the format object, do
something like this:
> Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)
>
> ```
> NumberFormat numFormat = NumberFormat.getInstance(loc);
> if (numFormat instanceof DecimalFormat decFormat) {
>     decFormat.setDecimalSeparatorAlwaysShown(true);
> }
> ```

A `DecimalFormat` comprises a *pattern* and a set of
*symbols*. The pattern may be set directly using
`applyPattern()`, or indirectly using the API methods. The
symbols are stored in a `DecimalFormatSymbols` object. When using
the `NumberFormat` factory methods, the pattern and symbols are
read from localized `ResourceBundle`s.

## Patterns

`DecimalFormat` patterns have the following syntax:
> ```
>  Pattern:
>          PositivePattern
>          PositivePattern ; NegativePattern
>  PositivePattern:
>          Prefixopt Number Suffixopt
>  NegativePattern:
>          Prefixopt Number Suffixopt
>  Prefix:
>          any Unicode characters except U+FFFE, U+FFFF, and special characters
>  Suffix:
>          any Unicode characters except U+FFFE, U+FFFF, and special characters
>  Number:
>          Integer Exponentopt
>          Integer . Fraction Exponentopt
>  Integer:
>          MinimumInteger
>          #
>          # Integer
>          # , Integer
>  MinimumInteger:
>          0
>          0 MinimumInteger
>          0 , MinimumInteger
>  Fraction:
>          MinimumFractionopt OptionalFractionopt
>  MinimumFraction:
>          0 MinimumFractionopt
>  OptionalFraction:
>          # OptionalFractionopt
>  Exponent:
>          E MinimumExponent
>  MinimumExponent:
>          0 MinimumExponentopt
> ```

A `DecimalFormat` pattern contains a positive and negative
subpattern, for example, `"#,##0.00;(#,##0.00)"`. Each
subpattern has a prefix, numeric part, and suffix. The negative subpattern
is optional; if absent, then the positive subpattern prefixed with the
minus sign (`'-' U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS`) is used as the
negative subpattern. That is, `"0.00"` alone is equivalent to
`"0.00;-0.00"`. If there is an explicit negative subpattern, it
serves only to specify the negative prefix and suffix; the number of digits,
minimal digits, and other characteristics are all the same as the positive
pattern. That means that `"#,##0.0#;(#)"` produces precisely
the same behavior as `"#,##0.0#;(#,##0.0#)"`.

The prefixes, suffixes, and various symbols used for infinity, digits,
grouping separators, decimal separators, etc. may be set to arbitrary
values, and they will appear properly during formatting. However, care must
be taken that the symbols and strings do not conflict, or parsing will be
unreliable. For example, either the positive and negative prefixes or the
suffixes must be distinct for `DecimalFormat.parse()` to be able
to distinguish positive from negative values. (If they are identical, then
`DecimalFormat` will behave as if no negative subpattern was
specified.) Another example is that the decimal separator and grouping
separator should be distinct characters, or parsing will be impossible.

The grouping separator is commonly used for thousands, but in some
countries it separates ten-thousands. The grouping size is a constant number
of digits between the grouping characters, such as 3 for 100,000,000 or 4 for
1,0000,0000. If you supply a pattern with multiple grouping characters, the
interval between the last one and the end of the integer is the one that is
used. So `"#,##,###,####"` == `"######,####"` ==
`"##,####,####"`.

### Special Pattern Characters

Many characters in a pattern are taken literally; they are matched during
parsing and output unchanged during formatting. Special characters, on the
other hand, stand for other characters, strings, or classes of characters.
They must be quoted, unless noted otherwise, if they are to appear in the
prefix or suffix as literals.

The characters listed here are used in non-localized patterns. Localized
patterns use the corresponding characters taken from this formatter's
`DecimalFormatSymbols` object instead, and these characters lose
their special status. Two exceptions are the currency sign and quote, which
are not localized.

### Scientific Notation

Numbers in scientific notation are expressed as the product of a mantissa
and a power of ten, for example, 1234 can be expressed as 1.234 x 10^3. The
mantissa is often in the range 1.0 ≤ x < 10.0, but it need not
be.
`DecimalFormat` can be instructed to format and parse scientific
notation *only via a pattern*; there is currently no factory method
that creates a scientific notation format. In a pattern, the exponent
character immediately followed by one or more digit characters indicates
scientific notation. Example: `"0.###E0"` formats the number
1234 as `"1.234E3"`.

* The number of digit characters after the exponent character gives the
  minimum exponent digit count. There is no maximum. Negative exponents are
  formatted using the localized minus sign, *not* the prefix and suffix
  from the pattern. This allows patterns such as `"0.###E0 m/s"`.* The *maximum integer* digits is the sum of '0's and '#'s
    prior to the decimal point. The *minimum integer* digits is the
    sum of the '0's prior to the decimal point. The *maximum fraction*
    and *minimum fraction* digits follow the same rules, but apply to the
    digits after the decimal point but before the exponent. For example, the
    following pattern: `"#00.0####E0"` would have a minimum number of
    integer digits = 2("00") and a maximum number of integer digits = 3("#00"). It
    would have a minimum number of fraction digits = 1("0") and a maximum number of fraction
    digits= 5("0####").* The minimum and maximum number of integer digits are interpreted
      together:
      + If the maximum number of integer digits is greater than their minimum number
        and greater than 1, it forces the exponent to be a multiple of the maximum
        number of integer digits, and the minimum number of integer digits to be
        interpreted as 1. The most common use of this is to generate
        *engineering notation*, in which the exponent is a multiple of three,
        e.g., `"##0.#####E0"`. Using this pattern, the number 12345
        formats to `"12.345E3"`, and 123456 formats to
        `"123.456E3"`.+ Otherwise, the minimum number of integer digits is achieved by adjusting the
          exponent. Example: 0.00123 formatted with `"00.###E0"` yields
          `"12.3E-4"`.* For a given number, the amount of significant digits in
        the mantissa can be calculated as such
        > ```
        >  Mantissa Digits:
        >          min(max(Minimum Pattern Digits, Original Number Digits), Maximum Pattern Digits)
        >  Minimum pattern Digits:
        >          Minimum Integer Digits + Minimum Fraction Digits
        >  Maximum pattern Digits:
        >          Maximum Integer Digits + Maximum Fraction Digits
        >  Original Number Digits:
        >          The amount of significant digits in the number to be formatted
        > ```

        This means that generally, a mantissa will have up to the combined maximum integer
        and fraction digits, if the original number itself has enough significant digits. However,
        if there are more minimum pattern digits than significant digits in the original number,
        the mantissa will have significant digits that equals the combined
        minimum integer and fraction digits. The number of significant digits
        does not affect parsing.

        It should be noted, that the integer portion of the mantissa will give
        any excess digits to the fraction portion, whether it be for precision or
        for satisfying the total amount of combined minimum digits.

        This behavior can be observed in the following example,

        Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

        ```
            DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat("#000.000##E0");
            df.format(12); // returns "12.0000E0"
            df.format(123456789) // returns "1.23456789E8"
        ```

        * Exponential patterns may not contain grouping separators.

### Rounding

`DecimalFormat` provides rounding modes defined in
[`RoundingMode`](../math/RoundingMode.md "enum class in java.math") for formatting. By default, it uses
[`RoundingMode.HALF_EVEN`](../math/RoundingMode.md#HALF_EVEN).

### Digits

For formatting, `DecimalFormat` uses the ten consecutive
characters starting with the localized zero digit defined in the
`DecimalFormatSymbols` object as digits. For parsing, these
digits as well as all Unicode decimal digits, as defined by
[`Character.digit`](../lang/Character.md#digit(char,int)), are recognized.

#### Special Values

Not a Number(`NaN`) is formatted as a string, which typically has a
single character `U+FFFD`. This string is determined by the
`DecimalFormatSymbols` object. This is the only value for which
the prefixes and suffixes are not used.

Infinity is formatted as a string, which typically has a single character
`U+221E`, with the positive or negative prefixes and suffixes
applied. The infinity string is determined by the
`DecimalFormatSymbols` object.

Negative zero (`"-0"`) parses to

* `BigDecimal(0)` if `isParseBigDecimal()` is
  true,* `Long(0)` if `isParseBigDecimal()` is false
    and `isParseIntegerOnly()` is true,* `Double(-0.0)` if both `isParseBigDecimal()`
      and `isParseIntegerOnly()` are false.

### Synchronization

Decimal formats are generally not synchronized.
It is recommended to create separate format instances for each thread.
If multiple threads access a format concurrently, it must be synchronized
externally.

### Example

> Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)
>
> ```
> // Print out a number using the localized number, integer, currency,
> // and percent format for each locale
> Locale[] locales = NumberFormat.getAvailableLocales();
> double myNumber = -1234.56;
> NumberFormat form;
> for (int j = 0; j < 4; ++j) {
>     System.out.println("FORMAT");
>     for (Locale locale : locales) {
>         if (locale.getCountry().length() == 0) {
>             continue; // Skip language-only locales
>         }
>         System.out.print(locale.getDisplayName());
>         form = switch (j) {
>             case 0 -> NumberFormat.getInstance(locale);
>             case 1 -> NumberFormat.getIntegerInstance(locale);
>             case 2 -> NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance(locale);
>             default -> NumberFormat.getPercentInstance(locale);
>         };
>         if (form instanceof DecimalFormat decForm) {
>             System.out.print(": " + decForm.toPattern());
>         }
>         System.out.print(" -> " + form.format(myNumber));
>         try {
>             System.out.println(" -> " + form.parse(form.format(myNumber)));
>         } catch (ParseException e) {}
>     }
> }
> ```

    :   `number` - the number to format
    :   `toAppendTo` - the `StringBuffer` to which the formatted
        text is to be appended
    :   `pos` - keeps track on the position of the field within the
        returned string. For example, for formatting a number
        `1234567.89` in `Locale.US` locale,
        if the given `fieldPosition` is
        [`NumberFormat.INTEGER_FIELD`](NumberFormat.md#INTEGER_FIELD), the begin index
        and end index of `fieldPosition` will be set
        to 0 and 9, respectively for the output string
        `1,234,567.89`.

    Returns:
    :   the value passed in as `toAppendTo`

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `number` is
        null or not an instance of `Number`.

  + ### parse

    public [Number](../lang/Number.md "class in java.lang") parse([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") text,
    [ParsePosition](ParsePosition.md "class in java.text") pos)

    Parses text from a string to produce a `Number`.

    The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by
    `pos`.
    If parsing succeeds, then the index of `pos` is updated
    to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
    use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
    number is returned. The updated `pos` can be used to
    indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
    If an error occurs, then the index of `pos` is not
    changed, the error index of `pos` is set to the index of
    the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.

    The subclass returned depends on the value of [`isParseBigDecimal()`](#isParseBigDecimal())
    as well as on the string being parsed.
    - If `isParseBigDecimal()` is false (the default),
      most integer values are returned as `Long`
      objects, no matter how they are written: `"17"` and
      `"17.000"` both parse to `Long(17)`.
      Values that cannot fit into a `Long` are returned as
      `Double`s. This includes values with a fractional part,
      infinite values, `NaN`, and the value -0.0.
      `DecimalFormat` does *not* decide whether to
      return a `Double` or a `Long` based on the
      presence of a decimal separator in the source string. Doing so
      would prevent integers that overflow the mantissa of a double,
      such as `"-9,223,372,036,854,775,808.00"`, from being
      parsed accurately.

      Callers may use the `Number` methods
      `doubleValue`, `longValue`, etc., to obtain
      the type they want.- If `isParseBigDecimal()` is true, values are returned
        as `BigDecimal` objects. The values are the ones
        constructed by [`BigDecimal(String)`](../math/BigDecimal.md#%3Cinit%3E(java.lang.String))
        for corresponding strings in locale-independent format. The
        special cases negative and positive infinity and NaN are returned
        as `Double` instances holding the values of the
        corresponding `Double` constants.

    `DecimalFormat` parses all Unicode characters that represent
    decimal digits, as defined by `Character.digit()`. In
    addition, `DecimalFormat` also recognizes as digits the ten
    consecutive characters starting with the localized zero digit defined in
    the `DecimalFormatSymbols` object.

    Specified by:
    :   `parse` in class `NumberFormat`

    Parameters:
    :   `text` - the string to be parsed
    :   `pos` - A `ParsePosition` object with index and error
        index information as described above.

    Returns:
    :   the parsed value, or `null` if the parse fails

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `text` or
        `pos` is null.

    public void applyPattern([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") pattern)

    Apply the given pattern to this Format object. A pattern is a
    short-hand specification for the various formatting properties.
    These properties can also be changed individually through the
    various setter methods.

    There is no limit to integer digits set
    by this routine, since that is the typical end-user desire;
    use setMaximumInteger if you want to set a real value.
    For negative numbers, use a second pattern, separated by a semicolon

    Example `"#,#00.0#"` → 1,234.56

    This means a minimum of 2 integer digits, 1 fraction digit, and
    a maximum of 2 fraction digits.

    Example: `"#,#00.0#;(#,#00.0#)"` for negatives in
    parentheses.

    In negative patterns, the minimum and maximum counts are ignored;
    these are presumed to be set in the positive pattern.

    Parameters:

    There is no limit to integer digits set
    by this routine, since that is the typical end-user desire;
    use setMaximumInteger if you want to set a real value.
    For negative numbers, use a second pattern, separated by a semicolon

    Example `"#,#00.0#"` → 1,234.56

    This means a minimum of 2 integer digits, 1 fraction digit, and
    a maximum of 2 fraction digits.

    Example: `"#,#00.0#;(#,#00.0#)"` for negatives in
    parentheses.

    In negative patterns, the minimum and maximum counts are ignored;
    these are presumed to be set in the positive pattern.

    Parameters:
    :   `pattern` - a new pattern

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `pattern` is null
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the given pattern is invalid.
