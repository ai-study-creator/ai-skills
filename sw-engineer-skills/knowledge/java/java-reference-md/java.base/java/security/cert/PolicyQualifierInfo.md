java.security.cert.PolicyQualifierInfo

---

public class PolicyQualifierInfo
extends [Object](../../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

An immutable policy qualifier represented by the ASN.1 PolicyQualifierInfo
structure.

The ASN.1 definition is as follows:

```
   PolicyQualifierInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
        policyQualifierId       PolicyQualifierId,
        qualifier               ANY DEFINED BY policyQualifierId }
```

A certificate policies extension, if present in an X.509 version 3
certificate, contains a sequence of one or more policy information terms,
each of which consists of an object identifier (OID) and optional
qualifiers. In an end-entity certificate, these policy information terms
indicate the policy under which the certificate has been issued and the
purposes for which the certificate may be used. In a CA certificate, these
policy information terms limit the set of policies for certification paths
which include this certificate.

A `Set` of `PolicyQualifierInfo` objects are returned
by the [`PolicyNode.getPolicyQualifiers`](PolicyNode.md#getPolicyQualifiers())
method. This allows applications with specific policy requirements to
process and validate each policy qualifier. Applications that need to
process policy qualifiers should explicitly set the
`policyQualifiersRejected` flag to false (by calling the
[`PKIXParameters.setPolicyQualifiersRejected`](PKIXParameters.md#setPolicyQualifiersRejected(boolean)) method) before validating
a certification path.

Note that the PKIX certification path validation algorithm specifies
that any policy qualifier in a certificate policies extension that is
marked critical must be processed and validated. Otherwise, the
certification path must be rejected. If the
`policyQualifiersRejected` flag is set to false, it is up to
the application to validate all policy qualifiers in this manner in order
to be PKIX compliant.

**Concurrent Access**

All `PolicyQualifierInfo` objects must be immutable and
thread-safe. That is, multiple threads may concurrently invoke the
methods defined in this class on a single `PolicyQualifierInfo`
object (or more than one) with no ill effects. Requiring
`PolicyQualifierInfo` objects to be immutable and thread-safe
allows them to be passed around to various pieces of code without
worrying about coordinating access.

  + ### PolicyQualifierInfo

    public PolicyQualifierInfo(byte[] encoded)
    throws [IOException](../../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Creates an instance of `PolicyQualifierInfo` from the
    encoded bytes. The encoded byte array is copied on construction.

    Parameters:
    :   `encoded` - a byte array containing the qualifier in DER encoding

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - thrown if the byte array does not represent a
        valid and parsable policy qualifier
* ## Method Details

  + ### getPolicyQualifierId

    public final [String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getPolicyQualifierId()

    Returns the `policyQualifierId` field of this
    `PolicyQualifierInfo`. The `policyQualifierId`
    is an Object Identifier (OID) represented by a set of nonnegative
    integers separated by periods.

    Returns:
    :   the OID (never `null`)
  + ### getEncoded

    public final byte[] getEncoded()

    Returns the ASN.1 DER encoded form of this
    `PolicyQualifierInfo`.

    Returns:
    :   the ASN.1 DER encoded bytes (never `null`).
        Note that a copy is returned, so the data is cloned each time
        this method is called.
  + ### getPolicyQualifier

    public final byte[] getPolicyQualifier()

    Returns the ASN.1 DER encoded form of the `qualifier`
    field of this `PolicyQualifierInfo`.

    Returns:
    :   the ASN.1 DER encoded bytes of the `qualifier`
        field. Note that a copy is returned, so the data is cloned each
        time this method is called.
  + ### toString

    public [String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Return a printable representation of this
    `PolicyQualifierInfo`.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a `String` describing the contents of this
        `PolicyQualifierInfo`
