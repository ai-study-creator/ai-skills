[java.lang.Object](../../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

java.security.cert.TrustAnchor

---

public class TrustAnchor
extends [Object](../../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

A trust anchor or most-trusted Certification Authority (CA).

This class represents a "most-trusted CA", which is used as a trust anchor
for validating X.509 certification paths. A most-trusted CA includes the
public key of the CA, the CA's name, and any constraints upon the set of
paths which may be validated using this key. These parameters can be
specified in the form of a trusted `X509Certificate` or as
individual parameters.

**Concurrent Access**

All `TrustAnchor` objects must be immutable and
thread-safe. That is, multiple threads may concurrently invoke the
methods defined in this class on a single `TrustAnchor`
object (or more than one) with no ill effects. Requiring
`TrustAnchor` objects to be immutable and thread-safe
allows them to be passed around to various pieces of code without
worrying about coordinating access. This stipulation applies to all
public fields and methods of this class and any added or overridden
by subclasses.

    public TrustAnchor([X509Certificate](X509Certificate.md "class in java.security.cert") trustedCert,
    byte[] nameConstraints)

    Creates an instance of `TrustAnchor` with the specified
    `X509Certificate` and optional name constraints, which
    are intended to be used as additional constraints when validating
    an X.509 certification path.

    The name constraints are specified as a byte array. This byte array
    should contain the DER encoded form of the name constraints, as they
    would appear in the NameConstraints structure defined in
    [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280)
    and X.509. The ASN.1 definition of this structure appears below.

    ```
      NameConstraints ::= SEQUENCE {
           permittedSubtrees       [0]     GeneralSubtrees OPTIONAL,
           excludedSubtrees        [1]     GeneralSubtrees OPTIONAL }

      GeneralSubtrees ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF GeneralSubtree

      GeneralSubtree ::= SEQUENCE {
           base                    GeneralName,
           minimum         [0]     BaseDistance DEFAULT 0,
           maximum         [1]     BaseDistance OPTIONAL }

      BaseDistance ::= INTEGER (0..MAX)

      GeneralName ::= CHOICE {
           otherName                       [0]     OtherName,
           rfc822Name                      [1]     IA5String,
           dNSName                         [2]     IA5String,
           x400Address                     [3]     ORAddress,
           directoryName                   [4]     Name,
           ediPartyName                    [5]     EDIPartyName,
           uniformResourceIdentifier       [6]     IA5String,
           iPAddress                       [7]     OCTET STRING,
           registeredID                    [8]     OBJECT IDENTIFIER}
    ```

    Note that the name constraints byte array supplied is cloned to protect
    against subsequent modifications.

    Parameters:
    :   `trustedCert` - a trusted `X509Certificate`
    :   `nameConstraints` - a byte array containing the ASN.1 DER encoding of
        a NameConstraints extension to be used for checking name constraints.
        Only the value of the extension is included, not the OID or criticality
        flag. Specify `null` to omit the parameter.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the name constraints cannot be
        decoded
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the specified
        `X509Certificate` is `null`
