`SignedObject` is a class for the purpose of creating authentic
runtime objects whose integrity cannot be compromised without being
detected.

More specifically, a `SignedObject` contains another Serializable
object, the (to-be-)signed object and its signature.

The signed object is a "deep copy" (in serialized form) of an
original object. Once the copy is made, further manipulation of
the original object has no side effect on the copy.

The underlying signing algorithm is designated by the Signature
object passed to the constructor and the `verify` method.
A typical usage for signing is the following:

```
 Signature signingEngine = Signature.getInstance(algorithm,
                                                 provider);
 SignedObject so = new SignedObject(myobject, signingKey,
                                    signingEngine);
```

A typical usage for verification is the following (having
received SignedObject `so`):

```
 Signature verificationEngine =
     Signature.getInstance(algorithm, provider);
 if (so.verify(publickey, verificationEngine))
     try {
         Object myobj = so.getObject();
     } catch (java.lang.ClassNotFoundException e) {};
```

Several points are worth noting. First, there is no need to
initialize the signing or verification engine, as it will be
re-initialized inside the constructor and the `verify`
method. Secondly, for verification to succeed, the specified
public key must be the public key corresponding to the private key
used to generate the `SignedObject`.

More importantly, for flexibility reasons, the
constructor and `verify` method allow for
customized signature engines, which can implement signature
algorithms that are not installed formally as part of a crypto
provider. However, it is crucial that the programmer writing the
verifier code be aware what `Signature` engine is being
used, as its own implementation of the `verify` method
is invoked to verify a signature. In other words, a malicious
`Signature` may choose to always return true on
verification in an attempt to bypass a security check.

The signature algorithm can be, among others, the NIST standard
DSA, using DSA and SHA-256. The algorithm is specified using the
same convention as that for signatures. The DSA algorithm using the
SHA-256 message digest algorithm can be specified, for example, as
"SHA256withDSA". In the case of
RSA the signing algorithm could be specified as, for example,
"SHA256withRSA". The algorithm name must be
specified, as there is no default.

The name of the Cryptography Package Provider is designated
also by the Signature parameter to the constructor and the
`verify` method. If the provider is not
specified, the default provider is used. Each installation can
be configured to use a particular provider as default.

Potential applications of `SignedObject` include:

* It can be used
  internally to any Java runtime as an unforgeable authorization
  token -- one that can be passed around without the fear that the
  token can be maliciously modified without being detected.* It
    can be used to sign and serialize data/object for storage outside
    the Java runtime (e.g., storing critical access control data on
    disk).* Nested SignedObjects can be used to construct a logical
      sequence of signatures, resembling a chain of authorization and
      delegation.
