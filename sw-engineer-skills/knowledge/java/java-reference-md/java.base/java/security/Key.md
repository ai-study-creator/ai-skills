public interface Key
extends [Serializable](../io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io")

The `Key` interface is the top-level interface for all keys. It
defines the functionality shared by all `Key` objects. All keys
have three characteristics:

* An Algorithm

  This is the key algorithm for that key. The key algorithm is usually
  an encryption or asymmetric operation algorithm (such as DSA or
  RSA), which will work with those algorithms and with related
  algorithms (such as MD5 with RSA, SHA-1 with RSA, Raw DSA, etc.)
  The name of the algorithm of a key is obtained using the
  [`getAlgorithm`](#getAlgorithm()) method.* An Encoded Form

    This is an external encoded form for the key used when a standard
    representation of the key is needed outside the Java Virtual Machine,
    as when transmitting the key to some other party. The key
    is encoded according to a standard format (such as
    X.509 `SubjectPublicKeyInfo` or PKCS#8), and
    is returned using the [`getEncoded`](#getEncoded()) method.
    Note: The syntax of the ASN.1 type `SubjectPublicKeyInfo`
    is defined as follows:

    ```
     SubjectPublicKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
       algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
       subjectPublicKey BIT STRING }

     AlgorithmIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
       algorithm OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
       parameters ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL }
    ```

    For more information, see
    [RFC 5280:
    Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280).* A Format

      This is the name of the format of the encoded key. It is returned
      by the [`getFormat`](#getFormat()) method.

Keys are generally obtained through key generators, certificates,
key stores or other classes used to manage keys.
Keys may also be obtained from key specifications (transparent
representations of the underlying key material) through the use of a key
factory (see [`KeyFactory`](KeyFactory.md "class in java.security")).

A Key should use KeyRep as its serialized representation.
Note that a serialized Key may contain sensitive information
which should not be exposed in untrusted environments. See the
[Security Appendix](../../../../specs/serialization/security.md)
of the Java Object Serialization Specification for more information.

    static final long serialVersionUID

    Deprecated.

    serialization compatibility with a previous
    version of the class.

* ## Method Details

  + ### getAlgorithm

    [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getAlgorithm()

    Returns the standard algorithm name for this key. For
    example, "DSA" would indicate that this key is a DSA key.
    See the key related sections (KeyFactory, KeyGenerator,
    KeyPairGenerator, and SecretKeyFactory) in the [Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification](../../../../specs/security/standard-names.md)
    for information about standard key algorithm names.

    Returns:
    :   the name of the algorithm associated with this key.
  + ### getFormat

    [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getFormat()

    Returns the name of the primary encoding format of this key,
    or `null` if this key does not support encoding.
    The primary encoding format is
    named in terms of the appropriate ASN.1 data format, if an
    ASN.1 specification for this key exists.
    For example, the name of the ASN.1 data format for public
    keys is *SubjectPublicKeyInfo*, as
    defined by the X.509 standard; in this case, the returned format is
    `"X.509"`. Similarly,
    the name of the ASN.1 data format for private keys is
    *PrivateKeyInfo*,
    as defined by the PKCS #8 standard; in this case, the returned format is
    `"PKCS#8"`.

    Returns:
    :   the primary encoding format of the key.
  + ### getEncoded

    byte[] getEncoded()

    Returns the key in its primary encoding format, or `null`
    if this key does not support encoding.

    Returns:
    :   the encoded key, or `null` if the key does not support
        encoding.
