# Class CodeSource

[java.lang.Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

java.security.CodeSource

All Implemented Interfaces:
:   `Serializable`

---

public class CodeSource
extends [Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Serializable](../io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io")

This class extends the concept of a codebase to
encapsulate not only the location (URL) but also the certificate chains
that were used to verify signed code originating from that location.

Since:
:   1.2

  + ### CodeSource

    public CodeSource([URL](../net/URL.md "class in java.net") url,
    [Certificate](cert/Certificate.md "class in java.security.cert")[] certs)

    Constructs a `CodeSource` and associates it with the specified
    location and set of certificates.

    Parameters:
    :   `url` - the location (URL). It may be `null`.
    :   `certs` - the certificate(s). It may be `null`. The contents
        of the array are copied to protect against subsequent modification.
  + ### CodeSource

    public CodeSource([URL](../net/URL.md "class in java.net") url,
    [CodeSigner](CodeSigner.md "class in java.security")[] signers)

    Constructs a `CodeSource` and associates it with the specified
    location and set of code signers.

    Parameters:
    :   `url` - the location (URL). It may be `null`.
    :   `signers` - the code signers. It may be `null`. The contents
        of the array are copied to protect against subsequent modification.

    Since:
    :   1.5
* ## Method Details

  + ### hashCode

    public int hashCode()

    Returns the hash code value for this object.

    Overrides:
    :   `hashCode` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a hash code value for this object.

    See Also:
    :   - [`Object.equals(java.lang.Object)`](../lang/Object.md#equals(java.lang.Object))
        - [`System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)`](../lang/System.md#identityHashCode(java.lang.Object))
  + ### equals

    public boolean equals([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") obj)

    Tests for equality between the specified object and this
    object. Two `CodeSource` objects are considered equal if their
    locations are of identical value and if their signer certificate
    chains are of identical value. It is not required that
    the certificate chains be in the same order.

    Overrides:
    :   `equals` in class `Object`

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - the object to test for equality with this object.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the objects are considered equal,
        `false` otherwise.

        - [`HashMap`](../util/HashMap.md "class in java.util")
  + ### getLocation

    public final [URL](../net/URL.md "class in java.net") getLocation()

    Returns the location associated with this `CodeSource`.

    Returns:
    :   the location (URL), or `null` if no URL was supplied
        during construction.
  + ### getCertificates

    public final [Certificate](cert/Certificate.md "class in java.security.cert")[] getCertificates()

    Returns the certificates associated with this `CodeSource`.

    If this `CodeSource` object was created using the
    [`CodeSource(URL url, CodeSigner[] signers)`](#%3Cinit%3E(java.net.URL,java.security.CodeSigner%5B%5D))
    constructor then its certificate chains are extracted and used to
    create an array of `Certificate` objects. Each signer certificate
    is followed by its supporting certificate chain (which may be empty).
    Each signer certificate and its supporting certificate chain is ordered
    bottom-to-top (i.e., with the signer certificate first and the (root)
    certificate authority last).

    Returns:
    :   a copy of the certificate array, or `null` if there
        is none.
  + ### getCodeSigners

    public final [CodeSigner](CodeSigner.md "class in java.security")[] getCodeSigners()

    Returns the code signers associated with this `CodeSource`.

    If this `CodeSource` object was created using the
    [`CodeSource(URL url, java.security.cert.Certificate[] certs)`](#%3Cinit%3E(java.net.URL,java.security.cert.Certificate%5B%5D))
    constructor then its certificate chains are extracted and used to
    create an array of `CodeSigner` objects. Note that only X.509
    certificates are examined - all other certificate types are ignored.

    Returns:
    :   a copy of the code signer array, or `null` if there
        is none.

    Since:
    :   1.5
  + ### implies

    public boolean implies([CodeSource](CodeSource.md "class in java.security") codesource)

    Returns true if this `CodeSource` object "implies" the specified
    `CodeSource`.

    More specifically, this method makes the following checks.
    If any fail, it returns `false`. If they all succeed, it returns
    `true`.
    - *codesource* must not be null.- If this object's certificates are not null, then all
        of this object's certificates must be present in *codesource*'s
        certificates.- If this object's location (getLocation()) is not null, then the
          following checks are made against this object's location and
          *codesource*'s:
          * *codesource*'s location must not be null.* If this object's location
              equals *codesource*'s location, then return true.* This object's protocol (getLocation().getProtocol()) must be
                equal to *codesource*'s protocol, ignoring case.* If this object's host (getLocation().getHost()) is not null,
                  then the SocketPermission
                  constructed with this object's host must imply the
                  SocketPermission constructed with *codesource*'s host.* If this object's port (getLocation().getPort()) is not
                    equal to -1 (that is, if a port is specified), it must equal
                    *codesource*'s port or default port
                    (codesource.getLocation().getDefaultPort()).* If this object's file (getLocation().getFile()) doesn't equal
                      *codesource*'s file, then the following checks are made:
                      If this object's file ends with "/-",
                      then *codesource*'s file must start with this object's
                      file (exclusive the trailing "-").
                      If this object's file ends with a "/\*",
                      then *codesource*'s file must start with this object's
                      file and must not have any further "/" separators.
                      If this object's file doesn't end with a "/",
                      then *codesource*'s file must match this object's
                      file with a '/' appended.* If this object's reference (getLocation().getRef()) is
                        not null, it must equal *codesource*'s reference.

    For example, the codesource objects with the following locations
    and `null` certificates all imply the codesource with the location
    `http://www.example.com/classes/foo.jar`
    and `null` certificates:

    ```
         http:
         http://*.example.com/classes/*
         http://www.example.com/classes/-
         http://www.example.com/classes/foo.jar
    ```

    Note that if this `CodeSource` has a `null` location and a
    `null` certificate chain, then it implies every other
    `CodeSource`.

    Parameters:
    :   `codesource` - `CodeSource` to compare against.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the specified codesource is implied by this
        codesource, `false` if not.
  + ### toString

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Returns a string describing this `CodeSource`, telling its
    URL and certificates.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   information about this `CodeSource`.
