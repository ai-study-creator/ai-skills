Direct Known Subclasses:
:   `SSLServerSocket`

---

public class ServerSocket
extends [Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Closeable](../io/Closeable.md "interface in java.io")

This class implements server sockets. A server socket waits for
requests to come in over the network. It performs some operation
based on that request, and then possibly returns a result to the requester.

The actual work of the server socket is performed by an instance
of the `SocketImpl` class.

The `ServerSocket` class defines convenience
methods to set and get several socket options. This class also
defines the [`setOption`](#setOption(java.net.SocketOption,T))
and [`getOption`](#getOption(java.net.SocketOption)) methods to set
and query socket options.
A `ServerSocket` supports the following options:
> Socket options
>
> | Option Name | Description |
> | --- | --- |
> | [`SO_RCVBUF`](StandardSocketOptions.md#SO_RCVBUF) | The size of the socket receive buffer |
> | [`SO_REUSEADDR`](StandardSocketOptions.md#SO_REUSEADDR) | Re-use address |

Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.

  + ### ServerSocket

    protected ServerSocket([SocketImpl](SocketImpl.md "class in java.net") impl)

    Creates a server socket with a user-specified `SocketImpl`.

    Parameters:
    :   `impl` - an instance of a SocketImpl to use on the ServerSocket.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if impl is `null`.
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager is set and
        its `checkPermission` method doesn't allow
        `NetPermission("setSocketImpl")`.

    Since:
    :   12
  + ### ServerSocket

    public ServerSocket()
    throws [IOException](../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Creates an unbound server socket.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - IO error when opening the socket.
  + ### ServerSocket

    public ServerSocket(int port)
    throws [IOException](../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Creates a server socket, bound to the specified port. A port number
    of `0` means that the port number is automatically
    allocated, typically from an ephemeral port range. This port
    number can then be retrieved by calling [`getLocalPort`](#getLocalPort()).

    The maximum queue length for incoming connection indications (a
    request to connect) is set to `50`. If a connection
    indication arrives when the queue is full, the connection is refused.

    If the application has specified a server socket implementation
    factory, that factory's `createSocketImpl` method is called to
    create the actual socket implementation. Otherwise a system-default
    socket implementation is created.

    If there is a security manager,
    its `checkListen` method is called
    with the `port` argument
    as its argument to ensure the operation is allowed.
    This could result in a SecurityException.

    Parameters:
    :   `port` - the port number, or `0` to use a port
        number that is automatically allocated.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs when opening the socket.
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its `checkListen`
        method doesn't allow the operation.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the port parameter is outside
        the specified range of valid port values, which is between
        0 and 65535, inclusive.

    See Also:
    :   - [`SocketImpl`](SocketImpl.md "class in java.net")
        - [`SecurityManager.checkListen(int)`](../lang/SecurityManager.md#checkListen(int))
  + ### ServerSocket

    public ServerSocket(int port,
    int backlog)
    throws [IOException](../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Creates a server socket and binds it to the specified local port
    number, with the specified backlog.
    A port number of `0` means that the port number is
    automatically allocated, typically from an ephemeral port range.
    This port number can then be retrieved by calling
    [`getLocalPort`](#getLocalPort()).

    The maximum queue length for incoming connection indications (a
    request to connect) is set to the `backlog` parameter. If
    a connection indication arrives when the queue is full, the
    connection is refused.

    If the application has specified a server socket implementation
    factory, that factory's `createSocketImpl` method is called to
    create the actual socket implementation. Otherwise a system-default
    socket implementation is created.

    If there is a security manager,
    its `checkListen` method is called
    with the `port` argument
    as its argument to ensure the operation is allowed.
    This could result in a SecurityException.
    The `backlog` argument is the requested maximum number of
    pending connections on the socket. Its exact semantics are implementation
    specific. In particular, an implementation may impose a maximum length
    or may choose to ignore the parameter altogether. The value provided
    should be greater than `0`. If it is less than or equal to
    `0`, then an implementation specific default will be used.

    Parameters:
    :   `port` - the port number, or `0` to use a port
        number that is automatically allocated.
    :   `backlog` - requested maximum length of the queue of incoming
        connections.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs when opening the socket.
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its `checkListen`
        method doesn't allow the operation.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the port parameter is outside
        the specified range of valid port values, which is between
        0 and 65535, inclusive.

    int backlog,
    [InetAddress](InetAddress.md "class in java.net") bindAddr)
    throws [IOException](../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Create a server with the specified port, listen backlog, and
    local IP address to bind to. The *bindAddr* argument
    can be used on a multi-homed host for a ServerSocket that
    will only accept connect requests to one of its addresses.
    If *bindAddr* is null, it will default accepting
    connections on any/all local addresses.
    The port must be between 0 and 65535, inclusive.
    A port number of `0` means that the port number is
    automatically allocated, typically from an ephemeral port range.
    This port number can then be retrieved by calling
    [`getLocalPort`](#getLocalPort()).

    If there is a security manager, this method
    calls its `checkListen` method
    with the `port` argument
    as its argument to ensure the operation is allowed.
    This could result in a SecurityException.
    The `backlog` argument is the requested maximum number of
    pending connections on the socket. Its exact semantics are implementation
    specific. In particular, an implementation may impose a maximum length
    or may choose to ignore the parameter altogether. The value provided
    should be greater than `0`. If it is less than or equal to
    `0`, then an implementation specific default will be used.

    Parameters:
    :   `port` - the port number, or `0` to use a port
        number that is automatically allocated.
    :   `backlog` - requested maximum length of the queue of incoming
        connections.
    :   `bindAddr` - the local InetAddress the server will bind to

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and
        its `checkListen` method doesn't allow the operation.
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs when opening the socket.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the port parameter is outside
        the specified range of valid port values, which is between
        0 and 65535, inclusive.

* ## Method Details

  + ### bind

    public void bind([SocketAddress](SocketAddress.md "class in java.net") endpoint)
    throws [IOException](../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Binds the `ServerSocket` to a specific address
    (IP address and port number).

    If the address is `null`, then the system will pick up
    an ephemeral port and a valid local address to bind the socket.

    Parameters:
    :   `endpoint` - The IP address and port number to bind to.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if the bind operation fails, or if the socket
        is already bound.
    :   `SecurityException` - if a `SecurityManager` is present and
        its `checkListen` method doesn't allow the operation.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if endpoint is a
        SocketAddress subclass not supported by this socket

    Since:
    :   1.4
  + ### bind

    public void bind([SocketAddress](SocketAddress.md "class in java.net") endpoint,
    int backlog)
    throws [IOException](../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Binds the `ServerSocket` to a specific address
    (IP address and port number).

    If the address is `null`, then the system will pick up
    an ephemeral port and a valid local address to bind the socket.

    The `backlog` argument is the requested maximum number of
    pending connections on the socket. Its exact semantics are implementation
    specific. In particular, an implementation may impose a maximum length
    or may choose to ignore the parameter altogether. The value provided
    should be greater than `0`. If it is less than or equal to
    `0`, then an implementation specific default will be used.

    Parameters:
    :   `endpoint` - The IP address and port number to bind to.
    :   `backlog` - requested maximum length of the queue of
        incoming connections.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if the bind operation fails, or if the socket
        is already bound.
    :   `SecurityException` - if a `SecurityManager` is present and
        its `checkListen` method doesn't allow the operation.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if endpoint is a
        SocketAddress subclass not supported by this socket

    Since:
    :   1.4
  + ### getInetAddress

    public [InetAddress](InetAddress.md "class in java.net") getInetAddress()

    Returns the local address of this server socket.

    If the socket was bound prior to being [`closed`](#close()),
    then this method will continue to return the local address
    after the socket is closed.

    If there is a security manager set, its `checkConnect` method is
    called with the local address and `-1` as its arguments to see
    if the operation is allowed. If the operation is not allowed,
    the [`loopback`](InetAddress.md#getLoopbackAddress()) address is returned.

    Returns:
    :   the address to which this socket is bound,
        or the loopback address if denied by the security manager,
        or `null` if the socket is unbound.

    See Also:
    :   - [`SecurityManager.checkConnect(java.lang.String, int)`](../lang/SecurityManager.md#checkConnect(java.lang.String,int))
  + ### getLocalPort

    public int getLocalPort()

    Returns the port number on which this socket is listening.

    If the socket was bound prior to being [`closed`](#close()),
    then this method will continue to return the port number
    after the socket is closed.

    Returns:
    :   the port number to which this socket is listening or
        -1 if the socket is not bound yet.
  + ### getLocalSocketAddress

    public [SocketAddress](SocketAddress.md "class in java.net") getLocalSocketAddress()

    Returns the address of the endpoint this socket is bound to.

    If the socket was bound prior to being [`closed`](#close()),
    then this method will continue to return the address of the endpoint
    after the socket is closed.

    If there is a security manager set, its `checkConnect` method is
    called with the local address and `-1` as its arguments to see
    if the operation is allowed. If the operation is not allowed,
    a `SocketAddress` representing the
    [`loopback`](InetAddress.md#getLoopbackAddress()) address and the local
    port to which the socket is bound is returned.

    Returns:
    :   a `SocketAddress` representing the local endpoint of
        this socket, or a `SocketAddress` representing the
        loopback address if denied by the security manager,
        or `null` if the socket is not bound yet.

    Since:
    :   1.4

  + ### accept

    public [Socket](Socket.md "class in java.net") accept()
    throws [IOException](../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Listens for a connection to be made to this socket and accepts
    it. The method blocks until a connection is made.

    This method is [interruptible](../lang/Thread.md#interrupt()) in the
    following circumstances:
    1. The socket is [associated](../nio/channels/ServerSocketChannel.md#socket())
       with a [`ServerSocketChannel`](../nio/channels/ServerSocketChannel.md "class in java.nio.channels"). In that
       case, interrupting a thread accepting a connection will close the
       underlying channel and cause this method to throw [`ClosedByInterruptException`](../nio/channels/ClosedByInterruptException.md "class in java.nio.channels") with the interrupt
       status set.+ The socket uses the system-default socket implementation and a
         [virtual thread](../lang/Thread.md#isVirtual()) is accepting a
         connection. In that case, interrupting the virtual thread will
         cause it to wakeup and close the socket. This method will then throw
         `SocketException` with the interrupt status set.

    A new Socket `s` is created and, if there
    is a security manager,
    the security manager's `checkAccept` method is called
    with `s.getInetAddress().getHostAddress()` and
    `s.getPort()`
    as its arguments to ensure the operation is allowed.
    This could result in a SecurityException.

    Returns:
    :   the new Socket

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs when waiting for a
        connection.
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its
        `checkAccept` method doesn't allow the operation.
    :   `SocketTimeoutException` - if a timeout was previously set with setSoTimeout and
        the timeout has been reached.
    :   `IllegalBlockingModeException` - if this socket has an associated channel, the channel is in
        non-blocking mode, and there is no connection ready to be
        accepted

    See Also:
    :   - [`SecurityManager.checkAccept(java.lang.String, int)`](../lang/SecurityManager.md#checkAccept(java.lang.String,int))
  + ### implAccept

    protected final void implAccept([Socket](Socket.md "class in java.net") s)
    throws [IOException](../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Subclasses of ServerSocket use this method to override accept()
    to return their own subclass of socket. So a FooServerSocket
    will typically hand this method a newly created, unbound, FooSocket.
    On return from implAccept the FooSocket will be connected to a client.

    The behavior of this method is unspecified when invoked with a
    socket that is not newly created and unbound. Any socket options set
    on the given socket prior to invoking this method may or may not be
    preserved when the connection is accepted. It may not be possible to
    accept a connection when this socket has a `SocketImpl` of one
    type and the given socket has a `SocketImpl` of a completely
    different type.

    Parameters:
    :   `s` - the Socket

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalBlockingModeException` - if this socket has an associated channel,
        and the channel is in non-blocking mode
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs when waiting
        for a connection, or if it is not possible for this socket
        to accept a connection with the given socket

    Since:
    :   1.1
  + ### close

    public void close()
    throws [IOException](../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Closes this socket.
    Any thread currently blocked in [`accept()`](#accept()) will throw
    a [`SocketException`](SocketException.md "class in java.net").

    If this socket has an associated channel then the channel is closed
    as well.

    Specified by:
    :   `close` in interface `AutoCloseable`

    Specified by:
    :   `close` in interface `Closeable`

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs when closing the socket.
  + ### getChannel

    public [ServerSocketChannel](../nio/channels/ServerSocketChannel.md "class in java.nio.channels") getChannel()

    Returns the unique [`ServerSocketChannel`](../nio/channels/ServerSocketChannel.md "class in java.nio.channels") object
    associated with this socket, if any.

    A server socket will have a channel if, and only if, the channel
    itself was created via the [`ServerSocketChannel.open`](../nio/channels/ServerSocketChannel.md#open())
    method.

    Returns:
    :   the server-socket channel associated with this socket,
        or `null` if this socket was not created
        for a channel

    Since:
    :   1.4
  + ### isBound

    public boolean isBound()

    Returns the binding state of the ServerSocket.

    If the socket was bound prior to being [closed](#close()),
    then this method will continue to return `true`
    after the socket is closed.

    Returns:
    :   true if the ServerSocket successfully bound to an address

    Since:
    :   1.4
  + ### isClosed

    public boolean isClosed()

    Returns the closed state of the ServerSocket.

    Returns:
    :   true if the socket has been closed

    Since:
    :   1.4
  + ### setSoTimeout

    public void setSoTimeout(int timeout)
    throws [SocketException](SocketException.md "class in java.net")

    Enable/disable [`SO_TIMEOUT`](SocketOptions.md#SO_TIMEOUT) with the
    specified timeout, in milliseconds. With this option set to a positive
    timeout value, a call to accept() for this ServerSocket
    will block for only this amount of time. If the timeout expires,
    a **java.net.SocketTimeoutException** is raised, though the
    ServerSocket is still valid. A timeout of zero is interpreted as an
    infinite timeout.
    The option **must** be enabled prior to entering the blocking
    operation to have effect.

    Parameters:
    :   `timeout` - the specified timeout, in milliseconds

    Throws:
    :   `SocketException` - if there is an error in the underlying protocol,
        such as a TCP error
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `timeout` is negative

    Since:
    :   1.1

    See Also:
    :   - [`getSoTimeout()`](#getSoTimeout())
  + ### getSoTimeout

    public int getSoTimeout()
    throws [IOException](../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Retrieve setting for [`SO_TIMEOUT`](SocketOptions.md#SO_TIMEOUT).
    0 returns implies that the option is disabled (i.e., timeout of infinity).

    Returns:
    :   the [`SO_TIMEOUT`](SocketOptions.md#SO_TIMEOUT) value

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs

    Since:
    :   1.1

    See Also:
    :   - [`setSoTimeout(int)`](#setSoTimeout(int))
  + ### setReuseAddress

    public void setReuseAddress(boolean on)
    throws [SocketException](SocketException.md "class in java.net")

    Enable/disable the [`SO_REUSEADDR`](SocketOptions.md#SO_REUSEADDR)
    socket option.

    When a TCP connection is closed the connection may remain
    in a timeout state for a period of time after the connection
    is closed (typically known as the `TIME_WAIT` state
    or `2MSL` wait state).
    For applications using a well known socket address or port
    it may not be possible to bind a socket to the required
    `SocketAddress` if there is a connection in the
    timeout state involving the socket address or port.

    Enabling [`SO_REUSEADDR`](SocketOptions.md#SO_REUSEADDR) prior to
    binding the socket using [`bind(SocketAddress)`](#bind(java.net.SocketAddress)) allows the socket
    to be bound even though a previous connection is in a timeout state.

    When a `ServerSocket` is created the initial setting
    of [`SO_REUSEADDR`](SocketOptions.md#SO_REUSEADDR) is not defined.
    Applications can use [`getReuseAddress()`](#getReuseAddress()) to determine the initial
    setting of [`SO_REUSEADDR`](SocketOptions.md#SO_REUSEADDR).

    The behaviour when [`SO_REUSEADDR`](SocketOptions.md#SO_REUSEADDR) is
    enabled or disabled after a socket is bound (See [`isBound()`](#isBound()))
    is not defined.

    Parameters:

    Tests if [`SO_REUSEADDR`](SocketOptions.md#SO_REUSEADDR) is enabled.

    Returns:
    :   a `boolean` indicating whether or not
        [`SO_REUSEADDR`](SocketOptions.md#SO_REUSEADDR) is enabled.

    Throws:

  + ### toString

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Returns the implementation address and implementation port of
    this socket as a `String`.

    If there is a security manager set, and this socket is
    [bound](#isBound()), its `checkConnect` method is
    called with the local address and `-1` as its arguments to see
    if the operation is allowed. If the operation is not allowed,
    an `InetAddress` representing the
    [`loopback`](InetAddress.md#getLoopbackAddress()) address is returned as
    the implementation address.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a string representation of this socket.
  + ### setSocketFactory

    [@Deprecated](../lang/Deprecated.md "annotation interface in java.lang")([since](../lang/Deprecated.md#since())="17")
    public static void setSocketFactory([SocketImplFactory](SocketImplFactory.md "interface in java.net") fac)
    throws [IOException](../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Deprecated.

    Use a [`ServerSocketFactory`](../../javax/net/ServerSocketFactory.md "class in javax.net") and subclass `ServerSocket`
    directly.
      
     This method provided a way in early JDK releases to replace the
    system wide implementation of `ServerSocket`. It has been mostly
    obsolete since Java 1.4. If required, a `ServerSocket` can be
    created to use a custom implementation by extending `ServerSocket`
    and using the [protected
    constructor](#%3Cinit%3E(java.net.SocketImpl)) that takes an [implementation](SocketImpl.md "class in java.net")
    as a parameter.

    Sets the server socket implementation factory for the
    application. The factory can be specified only once.

    When an application creates a new server socket, the socket
    implementation factory's `createSocketImpl` method is
    called to create the actual socket implementation.

    Passing `null` to the method is a no-op unless the factory
    was already set.

    If there is a security manager, this method first calls
    the security manager's `checkSetFactory` method
    to ensure the operation is allowed.
    This could result in a SecurityException.

    Parameters:
    :   `fac` - the desired factory.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs when setting the
        socket factory.
    :   `SocketException` - if the factory has already been defined.
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its
        `checkSetFactory` method doesn't allow the operation.

  + ### setReceiveBufferSize

    public void setReceiveBufferSize(int size)
    throws [SocketException](SocketException.md "class in java.net")

    Sets a default proposed value for the
    [`SO_RCVBUF`](SocketOptions.md#SO_RCVBUF) option for sockets
    accepted from this `ServerSocket`. The value actually set
    in the accepted socket must be determined by calling
    [`Socket.getReceiveBufferSize()`](Socket.md#getReceiveBufferSize()) after the socket
    is returned by [`accept()`](#accept()).

    The value of [`SO_RCVBUF`](SocketOptions.md#SO_RCVBUF) is used both to
    set the size of the internal socket receive buffer, and to set the size
    of the TCP receive window that is advertised to the remote peer.

    It is possible to change the value subsequently, by calling
    [`Socket.setReceiveBufferSize(int)`](Socket.md#setReceiveBufferSize(int)). However, if the application
    wishes to allow a receive window larger than 64K bytes, as defined by RFC1323
    then the proposed value must be set in the ServerSocket **before**
    it is bound to a local address. This implies, that the ServerSocket must be
    created with the no-argument constructor, then setReceiveBufferSize() must
    be called and lastly the ServerSocket is bound to an address by calling bind().

    Failure to do this will not cause an error, and the buffer size may be set to the
    requested value but the TCP receive window in sockets accepted from
    this ServerSocket will be no larger than 64K bytes.

    Parameters:
    :   `size` - the size to which to set the receive buffer
        size. This value must be greater than 0.

    Throws:
    :   `SocketException` - if there is an error
        in the underlying protocol, such as a TCP error.
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the
        value is 0 or is negative.

  + ### getReceiveBufferSize

    public int getReceiveBufferSize()
    throws [SocketException](SocketException.md "class in java.net")

    Gets the value of the [`SO_RCVBUF`](SocketOptions.md#SO_RCVBUF) option
    for this `ServerSocket`, that is the proposed buffer size that
    will be used for Sockets accepted from this `ServerSocket`.

    Note, the value actually set in the accepted socket is determined by
    calling [`Socket.getReceiveBufferSize()`](Socket.md#getReceiveBufferSize()).

    Returns:
    :   the value of the [`SO_RCVBUF`](SocketOptions.md#SO_RCVBUF)
        option for this `Socket`.

    Throws:
    :   `SocketException` - if there is an error
        in the underlying protocol, such as a TCP error.

  + ### setPerformancePreferences

    public void setPerformancePreferences(int connectionTime,
    int latency,
    int bandwidth)

    Sets performance preferences for this ServerSocket.

    Sockets use the TCP/IP protocol by default. Some implementations
    may offer alternative protocols which have different performance
    characteristics than TCP/IP. This method allows the application to
    express its own preferences as to how these tradeoffs should be made
    when the implementation chooses from the available protocols.

    Performance preferences are described by three integers
    whose values indicate the relative importance of short connection time,
    low latency, and high bandwidth. The absolute values of the integers
    are irrelevant; in order to choose a protocol the values are simply
    compared, with larger values indicating stronger preferences. If the
    application prefers short connection time over both low latency and high
    bandwidth, for example, then it could invoke this method with the values
    `(1, 0, 0)`. If the application prefers high bandwidth above low
    latency, and low latency above short connection time, then it could
    invoke this method with the values `(0, 1, 2)`.

    Invoking this method after this socket has been bound
    will have no effect. This implies that in order to use this capability
    requires the socket to be created with the no-argument constructor.

    Parameters:
    :   `connectionTime` - An `int` expressing the relative importance of a short
        connection time
    :   `latency` - An `int` expressing the relative importance of low
        latency
    :   `bandwidth` - An `int` expressing the relative importance of high
        bandwidth

        the option.
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs, or if the socket is closed.
    :   `NullPointerException` - if name is `null`
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager is set and if the socket
        option requires a security permission and if the caller does
        not have the required permission.
