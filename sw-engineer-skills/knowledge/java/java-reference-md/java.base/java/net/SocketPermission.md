public final class SocketPermission
extends [Permission](../security/Permission.md "class in java.security")
implements [Serializable](../io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io")

This class represents access to a network via sockets.
A SocketPermission consists of a
host specification and a set of "actions" specifying ways to
connect to that host. The host is specified as

```
    host = (hostname | IPv4address | iPv6reference) [:portrange]
    portrange = portnumber | -portnumber | portnumber-[portnumber]
```

The host is expressed as a DNS name, as a numerical IP address,
or as "localhost" (for the local machine).
The wildcard "\*" may be included once in a DNS name host
specification. If it is included, it must be in the leftmost
position, as in "\*.example.com".

The format of the IPv6reference should follow that specified in [*RFC 2732: Format
for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URLs*](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt):

```
    ipv6reference = "[" IPv6address "]"
```

For example, you can construct a SocketPermission instance
as the following:

```
    String hostAddress = inetaddress.getHostAddress();
    if (inetaddress instanceof Inet6Address) {
        sp = new SocketPermission("[" + hostAddress + "]:" + port, action);
    } else {
        sp = new SocketPermission(hostAddress + ":" + port, action);
    }
```

or

```
    String host = url.getHost();
    sp = new SocketPermission(host + ":" + port, action);
```

The [full uncompressed form](Inet6Address.md#lform) of
an IPv6 literal address is also valid.

The port or portrange is optional. A port specification of the
form "N-", where *N* is a port number, signifies all ports
numbered *N* and above, while a specification of the
form "-N" indicates all ports numbered *N* and below.
The special port value `0` refers to the entire *ephemeral*
port range. This is a fixed range of ports a system may use to
allocate dynamic ports from. The actual range may be system dependent.

The possible ways to connect to the host are

```
 accept
 connect
 listen
 resolve
```

The "listen" action is only meaningful when used with "localhost" and
means the ability to bind to a specified port.
The "resolve" action is implied when any of the other actions are present.
The action "resolve" refers to host/ip name service lookups.

The actions string is converted to lowercase before processing.

As an example of the creation and meaning of SocketPermissions,
note that if the following permission:

```
   p1 = new SocketPermission("foo.example.com:7777", "connect,accept");
```

is granted to some code, it allows that code to connect to port 7777 on
`foo.example.com`, and to accept connections on that port.

Similarly, if the following permission:

```
   p2 = new SocketPermission("localhost:1024-", "accept,connect,listen");
```

is granted to some code, it allows that code to
accept connections on, connect to, or listen on any port between
1024 and 65535 on the local host.

Note: Granting code permission to accept or make connections to remote
hosts may be dangerous because malevolent code can then more easily
transfer and share confidential data among parties who may not
otherwise have access to the data.

  + ### SocketPermission

    public SocketPermission([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") host,
    [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") action)

    Creates a new SocketPermission object with the specified actions.
    The host is expressed as a DNS name, or as a numerical IP address.
    Optionally, a port or a portrange may be supplied (separated
    from the DNS name or IP address by a colon).

    To specify the local machine, use "localhost" as the *host*.
    Also note: An empty *host* String ("") is equivalent to "localhost".

    The *actions* parameter contains a comma-separated list of the
    actions granted for the specified host (and port(s)). Possible actions are
    "connect", "listen", "accept", "resolve", or
    any combination of those. "resolve" is automatically added
    when any of the other three are specified.

    Examples of SocketPermission instantiation are the following:

    ```
        nr = new SocketPermission("www.example.com", "connect");
        nr = new SocketPermission("www.example.com:80", "connect");
        nr = new SocketPermission("*.example.com", "connect");
        nr = new SocketPermission("*.edu", "resolve");
        nr = new SocketPermission("204.160.241.0", "connect");
        nr = new SocketPermission("localhost:1024-65535", "listen");
        nr = new SocketPermission("204.160.241.0:1024-65535", "connect");
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `host` - the hostname or IP address of the computer, optionally
        including a colon followed by a port or port range.
    :   `action` - the action string.

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if any parameters are null
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the format of `host` is
        invalid, or if the `action` string is empty, malformed, or
        contains an action other than the specified possible actions
* ## Method Details

  + ### implies

    public boolean implies([Permission](../security/Permission.md "class in java.security") p)

    Checks if this socket permission object "implies" the
    specified permission.

    More specifically, this method first ensures that all of the following
    are true (and returns false if any of them are not):
    - *p* is an instanceof SocketPermission,- *p*'s actions are a proper subset of this
        object's actions, and- *p*'s port range is included in this port range. Note:
          port range is ignored when p only contains the action, 'resolve'.Then `implies` checks each of the following, in order,
    and for each returns true if the stated condition is true:
    - If this object was initialized with a single IP address and one of *p*'s
      IP addresses is equal to this object's IP address.- If this object is a wildcard domain (such as \*.example.com), and
        *p*'s canonical name (the name without any preceding \*)
        ends with this object's canonical host name. For example, \*.example.com
        implies \*.foo.example.com.- If this object was not initialized with a single IP address, and one of this
          object's IP addresses equals one of *p*'s IP addresses.- If this canonical name equals *p*'s canonical name.If none of the above are true, `implies` returns false.

    Specified by:
    :   `implies` in class `Permission`

    Parameters:
    :   `p` - the permission to check against.

    Returns:
    :   true if the specified permission is implied by this object,
        false if not.
  + ### equals

    public boolean equals([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") obj)

    Checks two SocketPermission objects for equality.

    Specified by:
    :   `equals` in class `Permission`

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - the object to test for equality with this object.

    Returns:
    :   true if *obj* is a SocketPermission, and has the
        same hostname, port range, and actions as this
        SocketPermission object. However, port range will be ignored
        in the comparison if *obj* only contains the action, 'resolve'.

    See Also:
    :   - [`Object.hashCode()`](../lang/Object.md#hashCode())
        - [`HashMap`](../util/HashMap.md "class in java.util")
  + ### hashCode

    public int hashCode()

    Returns the hash code value for this object.

    Specified by:
    :   `hashCode` in class `Permission`

    Returns:
    :   a hash code value for this object.

    See Also:
    :   - [`Object.equals(java.lang.Object)`](../lang/Object.md#equals(java.lang.Object))
        - [`System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)`](../lang/System.md#identityHashCode(java.lang.Object))
  + ### getActions

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getActions()

    Returns the canonical string representation of the actions.
    Always returns present actions in the following order:
    connect, listen, accept, resolve.

    Specified by:
    :   `getActions` in class `Permission`

    Returns:
    :   the canonical string representation of the actions.
  + ### newPermissionCollection

    public [PermissionCollection](../security/PermissionCollection.md "class in java.security") newPermissionCollection()

    Returns a new PermissionCollection object for storing SocketPermission
    objects.

    SocketPermission objects must be stored in a manner that allows them
    to be inserted into the collection in any order, but that also enables the
    PermissionCollection `implies`
    method to be implemented in an efficient (and consistent) manner.

    Overrides:
    :   `newPermissionCollection` in class `Permission`

    Returns:
    :   a new PermissionCollection object suitable for storing SocketPermissions.
