public final class URLPermission
extends [Permission](../security/Permission.md "class in java.security")

Represents permission to access a resource or set of resources defined by a
given url, and for a given set of user-settable request methods
and request headers. The *name* of the permission is the url string.
The *actions* string is a concatenation of the request methods and headers.
The range of method and header names is not restricted by this class.

**The url**

The url string has the following expected structure.

```
     scheme : // authority [ / path ] [ ignored-query-or-fragment ]
```

*scheme* will typically be http or https, but is not restricted by this
class.
*authority* is specified as:

```
     authority = [ userinfo @ ] hostrange [ : portrange ]
     portrange = portnumber | -portnumber | portnumber-[portnumber] | *
     hostrange = ([*.] dnsname) | IPv4address | IPv6address
```

*dnsname* is a standard DNS host or domain name, i.e. one or more labels
separated by ".". *IPv4address* is a standard literal IPv4 address and
*IPv6address* is as defined in [RFC 2732](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt). Literal IPv6 addresses must however, be enclosed in '[]' characters.
The *dnsname* specification can be preceded by "\*." which means
the name will match any hostname whose right-most domain labels are the same as
this name. For example, "\*.example.com" matches "foo.bar.example.com"

*portrange* is used to specify a port number, or a bounded or unbounded range of ports
that this permission applies to. If portrange is absent or invalid, then a default
port number is assumed if the scheme is `http` (default 80) or `https`
(default 443). No default is assumed for other schemes. A wildcard may be specified
which means all ports.

*userinfo* is optional. A userinfo component if present, is ignored when
creating a URLPermission, and has no effect on any other methods defined by this class.

The *path* component comprises a sequence of path segments,
separated by '/' characters. *path* may also be empty. The path is specified
in a similar way to the path in [`FilePermission`](../io/FilePermission.md "class in java.io"). There are
three different ways as the following examples show:

URL Examples

| Example url | Description |
| --- | --- |
| http://www.example.com/a/b/c.html | A url which identifies a specific (single) resource |
| http://www.example.com/a/b/\* | The '\*' character refers to all resources in the same "directory" - in other words all resources with the same number of path components, and which only differ in the final path component, represented by the '\*'. |
| http://www.example.com/a/b/- | The '-' character refers to all resources recursively below the preceding path (e.g. http://www.example.com/a/b/c/d/e.html matches this example). |

The '\*' and '-' may only be specified in the final segment of a path and must be
the only character in that segment. Any query or fragment components of the
url are ignored when constructing URLPermissions.

As a special case, urls of the form, "scheme:\*" are accepted to
mean any url of the given scheme.

The *scheme* and *authority* components of the url string are handled
without regard to case. This means [`equals(Object)`](#equals(java.lang.Object)),
[`hashCode()`](#hashCode()) and [`implies(Permission)`](#implies(java.security.Permission)) are case insensitive with respect
to these components. If the *authority* contains a literal IP address,
then the address is normalized for comparison. The path component is case sensitive.

*ignored-query-or-fragment* refers to any query or fragment which appears after the
path component, and which is ignored by the constructors of this class. It is defined as:

```
     ignored-query-or-fragment = [ ? query ] [ # fragment ]
```

where *query* and *fragment* are as defined in
[RFC2396](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2296.txt). [`getName()`](../security/Permission.md#getName()) therefore returns
only the *scheme*, *authority* and *path* components of the url string that
the permission was created with.

**The actions string**

The actions string of a URLPermission is a concatenation of the *method list*
and the *request headers list*. These are lists of the permitted request
methods and permitted request headers of the permission (respectively). The two lists
are separated by a colon ':' character and elements of each list are comma separated.
Some examples are:

* "POST,GET,DELETE"* "GET:X-Foo-Request,X-Bar-Request"* "POST,GET:Header1,Header2"

The first example specifies the methods: POST, GET and DELETE, but no request headers.
The second example specifies one request method and two headers. The third
example specifies two request methods, and two headers.

The colon separator need not be present if the request headers list is empty.
No white-space is permitted in the actions string. The action strings supplied to
the URLPermission constructors are case-insensitive and are normalized by converting
method names to upper-case and header names to the form defines in RFC2616 (lower case
with initial letter of each word capitalized). Either list can contain a wild-card '\*'
character which signifies all request methods or headers respectively.

Note. Depending on the context of use, some request methods and headers may be permitted
at all times, and others may not be permitted at any time. For example, the
HTTP protocol handler might disallow certain headers such as Content-Length
from being set by application code, regardless of whether the security policy
in force, permits it.

  + ### URLPermission

    public URLPermission([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") url,
    [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") actions)

    Creates a new URLPermission from a url string and which permits the given
    request methods and user-settable request headers.
    The name of the permission is the url string it was created with. Only the scheme,
    authority and path components of the url are used internally. Any fragment or query
    components are ignored. The permissions action string is as specified above.

    Parameters:
    :   `url` - the url string
    :   `actions` - the actions string

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if url is invalid or if actions contains white-space.

    Creates a URLPermission with the given url string and unrestricted
    methods and request headers by invoking the two argument
    constructor as follows: URLPermission(url, "\*:\*")

    Parameters:
    :   `url` - the url string

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if url does not result in a valid [`URI`](URI.md "class in java.net")
* ## Method Details

  + ### getActions

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getActions()

    Returns the normalized method list and request
    header list, in the form:

    ```
          "method-names : header-names"
    ```

    where method-names is the list of methods separated by commas
    and header-names is the list of permitted headers separated by commas.
    There is no white space in the returned String. If header-names is empty
    then the colon separator may not be present.

    Specified by:
    :   `getActions` in class `Permission`

    Returns:
    :   the actions of this `Permission`.
  + ### implies

    public boolean implies([Permission](../security/Permission.md "class in java.security") p)

    Checks if this URLPermission implies the given permission.
    Specifically, the following checks are done as if in the
    following sequence:
    - if 'p' is not an instance of URLPermission return false
    - if any of p's methods are not in this's method list, and if
      this's method list is not equal to "\*", then return false.
    - if any of p's headers are not in this's request header list, and if
      this's request header list is not equal to "\*", then return false.
    - if this's url scheme is not equal to p's url scheme return false
    - if the scheme specific part of this's url is '\*' return true
    - if the set of hosts defined by p's url hostrange is not a subset of
      this's url hostrange then return false. For example, "\*.foo.example.com"
      is a subset of "\*.example.com". "foo.bar.example.com" is not
      a subset of "\*.foo.example.com"
    - if the portrange defined by p's url is not a subset of the
      portrange defined by this's url then return false.- if the path or paths specified by p's url are contained in the
        set of paths specified by this's url, then return true- otherwise, return false

    Some examples of how paths are matched are shown below:

    Examples of Path Matching

    | this's path | p's path | match |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | /a/b | /a/b | yes |
    | /a/b/\* | /a/b/c | yes |
    | /a/b/c/d | no |
    | /a/b/c/- | no |
    | /a/b/- | /a/b/c/d | yes |
    | /a/b/c/d/e | yes |
    | /a/b/c/\* | yes |
