public class URLClassLoader
extends [SecureClassLoader](../security/SecureClassLoader.md "class in java.security")
implements [Closeable](../io/Closeable.md "interface in java.io")

This class loader is used to load classes and resources from a search
path of URLs referring to both JAR files and directories. Any `jar:`
scheme URL (see [`JarURLConnection`](JarURLConnection.md "class in java.net")) is assumed to refer to a
JAR file. Any `file:` scheme URL that ends with a '/' is assumed to
refer to a directory. Otherwise, the URL is assumed to refer to a JAR file
which will be opened as needed.

This class loader supports the loading of classes and resources from the
contents of a [multi-release](../util/jar/JarFile.md#multirelease)
JAR file that is referred to by a given URL.

The AccessControlContext of the thread that created the instance of
URLClassLoader will be used when subsequently loading classes and
resources.

The classes that are loaded are by default granted permission only to
access the URLs specified when the URLClassLoader was created.

    public URLClassLoader([URL](URL.md "class in java.net")[] urls,
    [ClassLoader](../lang/ClassLoader.md "class in java.lang") parent)

    Constructs a new URLClassLoader for the given URLs. The URLs will be
    searched in the order specified for classes and resources after first
    searching in the specified parent class loader. Any `jar:`
    scheme URL is assumed to refer to a JAR file. Any `file:` scheme
    URL that ends with a '/' is assumed to refer to a directory. Otherwise,
    the URL is assumed to refer to a JAR file which will be downloaded and
    opened as needed.

    If there is a security manager, this method first
    calls the security manager's `checkCreateClassLoader` method
    to ensure creation of a class loader is allowed.

    Parameters:
    :   `urls` - the URLs from which to load classes and resources
    :   `parent` - the parent class loader for delegation

    Throws:
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its
        `checkCreateClassLoader` method doesn't allow
        creation of a class loader.
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `urls` or any of its
        elements is `null`.

    Constructs a new URLClassLoader for the specified URLs using the
    default delegation parent `ClassLoader`. The URLs will
    be searched in the order specified for classes and resources after
    first searching in the parent class loader. Any URL that ends with
    a '/' is assumed to refer to a directory. Otherwise, the URL is
    assumed to refer to a JAR file which will be downloaded and opened
    as needed.

    If there is a security manager, this method first
    calls the security manager's `checkCreateClassLoader` method
    to ensure creation of a class loader is allowed.

    Parameters:
    :   `urls` - the URLs from which to load classes and resources

* ## Method Details

  + ### getResourceAsStream

    public [InputStream](../io/InputStream.md "class in java.io") getResourceAsStream([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name)

    Returns an input stream for reading the specified resource.
    If this loader is closed, then any resources opened by this method
    will be closed.

    The search order is described in the documentation for [`ClassLoader.getResource(String)`](../lang/ClassLoader.md#getResource(java.lang.String)).

    Overrides:
    :   `getResourceAsStream` in class `ClassLoader`

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - The resource name

    Returns:
    :   An input stream for reading the resource, or `null`
        if the resource could not be found

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - If `name` is `null`

    Since:
    :   1.7
  + ### close

    public void close()
    throws [IOException](../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Closes this URLClassLoader, so that it can no longer be used to load
    new classes or resources that are defined by this loader.
    Classes and resources defined by any of this loader's parents in the
    delegation hierarchy are still accessible. Also, any classes or resources
    that are already loaded, are still accessible.

    In the case of jar: and file: URLs, it also closes any files
    that were opened by it. If another thread is loading a
    class when the `close` method is invoked, then the result of
    that load is undefined.

    The method makes a best effort attempt to close all opened files,
    by catching [`IOException`](../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")s internally. Unchecked exceptions
    and errors are not caught. Calling close on an already closed
    loader has no effect.

    Specified by:
    :   `close` in interface `AutoCloseable`

    Specified by:
    :   `close` in interface `Closeable`

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if closing any file opened by this class loader
        resulted in an IOException. Any such exceptions are caught internally.
        If only one is caught, then it is re-thrown. If more than one exception
        is caught, then the second and following exceptions are added
        as suppressed exceptions of the first one caught, which is then re-thrown.
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager is set, and it denies
        [`RuntimePermission`](../lang/RuntimePermission.md "class in java.lang")`("closeClassLoader")`

    Since:
    :   1.7
  + ### addURL

    protected void addURL([URL](URL.md "class in java.net") url)

    Appends the specified URL to the list of URLs to search for
    classes and resources.

    If the URL specified is `null` or is already in the
    list of URLs, or if this loader is closed, then invoking this
    method has no effect.

    Parameters:
    :   `url` - the URL to be added to the search path of URLs
  + ### getURLs

    public [URL](URL.md "class in java.net")[] getURLs()

  + ### findClass

    protected [Class](../lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<?> findClass([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name)
    throws [ClassNotFoundException](../lang/ClassNotFoundException.md "class in java.lang")

    Finds and loads the class with the specified name from the URL search
    path. Any URLs referring to JAR files are loaded and opened as needed
    until the class is found.

    Overrides:
    :   `findClass` in class `ClassLoader`

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - the name of the class

    Returns:
    :   the resulting class

    Throws:
    :   `ClassNotFoundException` - if the class could not be found,
        or if the loader is closed.
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `name` is `null`.
  + ### definePackage

    protected [Package](../lang/Package.md "class in java.lang") definePackage([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name,
    [Manifest](../util/jar/Manifest.md "class in java.util.jar") man,
    [URL](URL.md "class in java.net") url)

    Defines a new package by name in this `URLClassLoader`.
    The attributes contained in the specified `Manifest`
    will be used to obtain package version and sealing information.
    For sealed packages, the additional URL specifies the code source URL
    from which the package was loaded.

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - the package name
    :   `man` - the `Manifest` containing package version and sealing
        information
    :   `url` - the code source url for the package, or null if none

    Returns:
    :   the newly defined `Package` object

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if the package name is
        already defined by this class loader
  + ### findResource

    public [URL](URL.md "class in java.net") findResource([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name)

    Finds the resource with the specified name on the URL search path.

    Overrides:
    :   `findResource` in class `ClassLoader`

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - the name of the resource

    Returns:
    :   a `URL` for the resource, or `null`
        if the resource could not be found, or if the loader is closed.
  + ### findResources

    public [Enumeration](../util/Enumeration.md "interface in java.util")<[URL](URL.md "class in java.net")> findResources([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name)
    throws [IOException](../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Returns an Enumeration of URLs representing all of the resources
    on the URL search path having the specified name.

    Overrides:
    :   `findResources` in class `ClassLoader`

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - the resource name

    Returns:
    :   An `Enumeration` of `URL`s.
        If the loader is closed, the Enumeration contains no elements.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O exception occurs
  + ### getPermissions

    protected [PermissionCollection](../security/PermissionCollection.md "class in java.security") getPermissions([CodeSource](../security/CodeSource.md "class in java.security") codesource)

    Returns the permissions for the given codesource object.
    The implementation of this method first calls super.getPermissions
    and then adds permissions based on the URL of the codesource.

    If the protocol of this URL is "jar", then the permission granted
    is based on the permission that is required by the URL of the Jar
    file.

    If the protocol is "file" and there is an authority component, then
    permission to connect to and accept connections from that authority
    may be granted. If the protocol is "file"
    and the path specifies a file, then permission to read that
    file is granted. If protocol is "file" and the path is
    a directory, permission is granted to read all files
    and (recursively) all files and subdirectories contained in
    that directory.

    If the protocol is not "file", then permission
    to connect to and accept connections from the URL's host is granted.

    Overrides:
    :   `getPermissions` in class `SecureClassLoader`

    Parameters:
    :   `codesource` - the codesource

    Returns:
    :   the permissions granted to the codesource

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `codesource` is `null`.
  + ### newInstance

    public static [URLClassLoader](URLClassLoader.md "class in java.net") newInstance([URL](URL.md "class in java.net")[] urls,
    [ClassLoader](../lang/ClassLoader.md "class in java.lang") parent)

    Creates a new instance of URLClassLoader for the specified
    URLs and parent class loader. If a security manager is
    installed, the `loadClass` method of the URLClassLoader
    returned by this method will invoke the
    `SecurityManager.checkPackageAccess` method before
    loading the class.

    Parameters:
    :   `urls` - the URLs to search for classes and resources
    :   `parent` - the parent class loader for delegation

    Returns:
    :   the resulting class loader

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `urls` or any of its
        elements is `null`.
  + ### newInstance

    public static [URLClassLoader](URLClassLoader.md "class in java.net") newInstance([URL](URL.md "class in java.net")[] urls)

    Creates a new instance of URLClassLoader for the specified
    URLs and default parent class loader. If a security manager is
    installed, the `loadClass` method of the URLClassLoader
    returned by this method will invoke the
    `SecurityManager.checkPackageAccess` before
    loading the class.

    Parameters:
    :   `urls` - the URLs to search for classes and resources

    Returns:
    :   the resulting class loader

    Throws:
    :   `NullPointerException` - if `urls` or any of its
