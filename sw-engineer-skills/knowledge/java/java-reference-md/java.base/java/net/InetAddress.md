public sealed class InetAddress
extends [Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Serializable](../io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io")
permits [Inet4Address](Inet4Address.md "class in java.net"), [Inet6Address](Inet6Address.md "class in java.net")

This class represents an Internet Protocol (IP) address.

An IP address is either a 32-bit or 128-bit unsigned number
used by IP, a lower-level protocol on which protocols like UDP and
TCP are built. The IP address architecture is defined by [*RFC 790:
Assigned Numbers*](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc790.txt),  [*RFC 1918:
Address Allocation for Private Internets*](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt), [*RFC 2365:
Administratively Scoped IP Multicast*](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2365.txt), and [*RFC 2373: IP
Version 6 Addressing Architecture*](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2373.txt). An instance of an
InetAddress consists of an IP address and possibly its
corresponding host name (depending on whether it is constructed
with a host name or whether it has already done reverse host name
resolution).

## Address types

Description of unicast and multicast address types

| Address Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| unicast | An identifier for a single interface. A packet sent to a unicast address is delivered to the interface identified by that address. The Unspecified Address -- Also called anylocal or wildcard address. It must never be assigned to any node. It indicates the absence of an address. One example of its use is as the target of bind, which allows a server to accept a client connection on any interface, in case the server host has multiple interfaces. The *unspecified* address must not be used as the destination address of an IP packet. The *Loopback* Addresses -- This is the address assigned to the loopback interface. Anything sent to this IP address loops around and becomes IP input on the local host. This address is often used when testing a client. |
| multicast | An identifier for a set of interfaces (typically belonging to different nodes). A packet sent to a multicast address is delivered to all interfaces identified by that address. |

### IP address scope

*Link-local* addresses are designed to be used for addressing
on a single link for purposes such as auto-address configuration,
neighbor discovery, or when no routers are present.

*Site-local* addresses are designed to be used for addressing
inside of a site without the need for a global prefix.

*Global* addresses are unique across the internet.

### Textual representation of IP addresses

The textual representation of an IP address is address family specific.

For IPv4 address format, please refer to [Inet4Address#format](Inet4Address.md#format); For IPv6
address format, please refer to [Inet6Address#format](Inet6Address.md#format).

There is a [couple of
System Properties](doc-files/net-properties.md#Ipv4IPv6) affecting how IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are used.

## Host Name Resolution

The InetAddress class provides methods to resolve host names to
their IP addresses and vice versa. The actual resolution is delegated to an
[InetAddress resolver](spi/InetAddressResolver.md "interface in java.net.spi").

*Host name-to-IP address resolution* maps a host name to an IP address.
For any host name, its corresponding IP address is returned.

*Reverse name resolution* means that for any IP address,
the host associated with the IP address is returned.

The built-in InetAddress resolver implementation does
host name-to-IP address resolution and vice versa through the use of
a combination of local machine configuration information and network
naming services such as the Domain Name System (DNS) and the Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP).
The particular naming services that the built-in resolver uses by default
depends on the configuration of the local machine.

`InetAddress` has a service provider mechanism for InetAddress resolvers
that allows a custom InetAddress resolver to be used instead of the built-in implementation.
[`InetAddressResolverProvider`](spi/InetAddressResolverProvider.md "class in java.net.spi") is the service provider class. Its API docs provide all the
details on this mechanism.

## InetAddress Caching

The InetAddress class has a cache to store successful as well as
unsuccessful host name resolutions.

By default, when a security manager is installed, in order to
protect against DNS spoofing attacks,
the result of positive host name resolutions are
cached forever. When a security manager is not installed, the default
behavior is to cache entries for a finite (implementation dependent)
period of time. The result of unsuccessful host
name resolution is cached for a very short period of time (10
seconds) to improve performance.

If the default behavior is not desired, then a Java security property
can be set to a different Time-to-live (TTL) value for positive
caching. Likewise, a system admin can configure a different
negative caching TTL value when needed or extend the usage of the stale data.

Three Java security properties control the TTL values used for
positive and negative host name resolution caching:

**networkaddress.cache.ttl**
:   Indicates the caching policy for successful name lookups from
    the name service. The value is specified as an integer to indicate
    the number of seconds to cache the successful lookup. The default
    setting is to cache for an implementation specific period of time.

    A value of -1 indicates "cache forever".

**networkaddress.cache.stale.ttl**
:   Indicates the caching policy for stale names. The value is specified as
    an integer to indicate the number of seconds that stale names will be kept in
    the cache. A name is considered stale if the TTL has expired and an attempt
    to lookup the host name again was not successful. This property is useful if
    it is preferable to use a stale name rather than fail due to an unsuccessful
    lookup. The default setting is to cache for an implementation specific period
    of time.

    If the value of this property is larger than "networkaddress.cache.ttl" then
    "networkaddress.cache.ttl" will be used as a refresh interval of the name in
    the cache. For example, if this property is set to 1 day and
    "networkaddress.cache.ttl" is set to 30 seconds, then the positive response
    will be cached for 1 day but an attempt to refresh it will be done every
    30 seconds.

    A value of 0 (zero) or if the property is not set means do not use stale
    names. Negative values are ignored.

**networkaddress.cache.negative.ttl** (default: 10)
:   Indicates the caching policy for un-successful name lookups
    from the name service. The value is specified as an integer to
    indicate the number of seconds to cache the failure for
    un-successful lookups.

    A value of 0 indicates "never cache".
    A value of -1 indicates "cache forever".

  + ### isReachable

    public boolean isReachable(int timeout)
    throws [IOException](../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Test whether that address is reachable. Best effort is made by the
    implementation to try to reach the host, but firewalls and server
    configuration may block requests resulting in an unreachable status
    while some specific ports may be accessible.
    A typical implementation will use ICMP ECHO REQUESTs if the
    privilege can be obtained, otherwise it will try to establish
    a TCP connection on port 7 (Echo) of the destination host.

    The timeout value, in milliseconds, indicates the maximum amount of time
    the try should take. If the operation times out before getting an
    answer, the host is deemed unreachable. A negative value will result
    in an IllegalArgumentException being thrown.

    Parameters:
    :   `timeout` - the time, in milliseconds, before the call aborts

    Returns:
    :   a `boolean` indicating if the address is reachable.

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if a network error occurs
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if `timeout` is negative.

  + ### isReachable

    public boolean isReachable([NetworkInterface](NetworkInterface.md "class in java.net") netif,
    int ttl,
    int timeout)
    throws [IOException](../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Test whether that address is reachable. Best effort is made by the
    implementation to try to reach the host, but firewalls and server
    configuration may block requests resulting in a unreachable status
    while some specific ports may be accessible.
    A typical implementation will use ICMP ECHO REQUESTs if the
    privilege can be obtained, otherwise it will try to establish
    a TCP connection on port 7 (Echo) of the destination host.

    The `network interface` and `ttl` parameters
    let the caller specify which network interface the test will go through
    and the maximum number of hops the packets should go through.
    A negative value for the `ttl` will result in an
    IllegalArgumentException being thrown.

    The timeout value, in milliseconds, indicates the maximum amount of time
    the try should take. If the operation times out before getting an
    answer, the host is deemed unreachable. A negative value will result
    in an IllegalArgumentException being thrown.

    Parameters:
    :   `netif` - the NetworkInterface through which the
        test will be done, or null for any interface
    :   `ttl` - the maximum numbers of hops to try or 0 for the
        default
    :   `timeout` - the time, in milliseconds, before the call aborts

    Returns:
    :   a `boolean` indicating if the address is reachable.

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if either `timeout`
        or `ttl` are negative.
    :   `IOException` - if a network error occurs

    Since:
    :   1.5
  + ### getHostName

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getHostName()

    Gets the host name for this IP address.

    If this InetAddress was created with a host name,
    this host name will be remembered and returned;
    otherwise, a reverse name lookup will be performed
    and the result will be returned based on the system
    configured resolver. If a lookup of the name service
    is required, call
    [`getCanonicalHostName`](#getCanonicalHostName()).

    If there is a security manager, its
    `checkConnect` method is first called
    with the hostname and `-1`
    as its arguments to see if the operation is allowed.
    If the operation is not allowed, it will return
    the textual representation of the IP address.

    Returns:
    :   the host name for this IP address, or if the operation
        is not allowed by the security check, the textual
        representation of the IP address.

    See Also:

  + ### getCanonicalHostName

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getCanonicalHostName()

    Gets the fully qualified domain name for this IP address.
    Best effort method, meaning we may not be able to return
    the FQDN depending on the underlying system configuration.

    If there is a security manager, this method first
    calls its `checkConnect` method
    with the hostname and `-1`
    as its arguments to see if the calling code is allowed to know
    the hostname for this IP address, i.e., to connect to the host.
    If the operation is not allowed, it will return
    the textual representation of the IP address.

    Returns:
    :   the fully qualified domain name for this IP address,
        or if the operation is not allowed by the security check,
        the textual representation of the IP address.

    public byte[] getAddress()

    Returns the raw IP address of this `InetAddress`
    object. The result is in network byte order: the highest order
    byte of the address is in `getAddress()[0]`.

    Returns:
    :   the raw IP address of this object.
  + ### getHostAddress

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getHostAddress()

        - [`System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)`](../lang/System.md#identityHashCode(java.lang.Object))
  + ### equals

    public boolean equals([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") obj)

    Compares this object against the specified object.
    The result is `true` if and only if the argument is
    not `null` and it represents the same IP address as
    this object.

    Two instances of `InetAddress` represent the same IP
    address if the length of the byte arrays returned by
    `getAddress` is the same for both, and each of the
    array components is the same for the byte arrays.

    Overrides:
    :   `equals` in class `Object`

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - the object to compare against.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the objects are the same;
        `false` otherwise.

    :   - [`getAddress()`](#getAddress())
  + ### toString

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Converts this IP address to a `String`. The
    string returned is of the form: hostname / literal IP
    address.
    If the host name is unresolved, no reverse lookup
    is performed. The hostname part will be represented
    by an empty string.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a string representation of this IP address.
  + ### getByAddress

    public static [InetAddress](InetAddress.md "class in java.net") getByAddress([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") host,
    byte[] addr)
    throws [UnknownHostException](UnknownHostException.md "class in java.net")

    Creates an InetAddress based on the provided host name and IP address.
    The system-wide [resolver](spi/InetAddressResolver.md "interface in java.net.spi") is not used to check
    the validity of the address.

    The host name can either be a machine name, such as
    "`www.example.com`", or a textual representation of its IP
    address.

    No validity checking is done on the host name either.

    If addr specifies an IPv4 address an instance of Inet4Address
    will be returned; otherwise, an instance of Inet6Address
    will be returned.

    IPv4 address byte array must be 4 bytes long and IPv6 byte array
    must be 16 bytes long

    Parameters:
    :   `host` - the specified host
    :   `addr` - the raw IP address in network byte order

    Returns:
    :   an InetAddress object created from the raw IP address.

    Throws:
    :   `UnknownHostException` - if IP address is of illegal length

    Since:
    :   1.4
  + ### getByName

    public static [InetAddress](InetAddress.md "class in java.net") getByName([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") host)
    throws [UnknownHostException](UnknownHostException.md "class in java.net")

    Determines the IP address of a host, given the host's name.

    The host name can either be a machine name, such as
    "`www.example.com`", or a textual representation of its
    IP address. If a literal IP address is supplied, only the
    validity of the address format is checked.

    For `host` specified in literal IPv6 address,
    either the form defined in RFC 2732 or the literal IPv6 address
    format defined in RFC 2373 is accepted. IPv6 scoped addresses are also
    supported. See [here](Inet6Address.md#scoped) for a description of IPv6
    scoped addresses.

    If the host is `null` or `host.length()` is equal
    to zero, then an `InetAddress` representing an address of the
    loopback interface is returned.
    See [RFC 3330](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3330.txt)
    section 2 and [RFC 2373](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2373.txt)
    section 2.5.3.

    If there is a security manager, and `host` is not `null`
    or `host.length()`  is not equal to zero, the security manager's
    `checkConnect` method is called with the hostname and `-1`
    as its arguments to determine if the operation is allowed.

    Parameters:
    :   `host` - the specified host, or `null`.

    Returns:
    :   an IP address for the given host name.

    Throws:
    :   `UnknownHostException` - if no IP address for the
        `host` could be found, or if a scope\_id was specified
        for a global IPv6 address.
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists
        and its checkConnect method doesn't allow the operation

  + ### getAllByName

    public static [InetAddress](InetAddress.md "class in java.net")[] getAllByName([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") host)
    throws [UnknownHostException](UnknownHostException.md "class in java.net")

    Given the name of a host, returns an array of its IP addresses,
    based on the configured system [resolver](spi/InetAddressResolver.md "interface in java.net.spi").

    The host name can either be a machine name, such as
    "`www.example.com`", or a textual representation of its IP
    address. If a literal IP address is supplied, only the
    validity of the address format is checked.

    For `host` specified in *literal IPv6 address*,
    either the form defined in RFC 2732 or the literal IPv6 address
    format defined in RFC 2373 is accepted. A literal IPv6 address may
    also be qualified by appending a scoped zone identifier or scope\_id.
    The syntax and usage of scope\_ids is described
    [here](Inet6Address.md#scoped).

    If the host is `null` or `host.length()` is equal
    to zero, then an `InetAddress` representing an address of the
    loopback interface is returned.
    See [RFC 3330](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3330.txt)
    section 2 and [RFC 2373](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2373.txt)
    section 2.5.3.

    If there is a security manager, and `host` is not `null`
    or `host.length()`  is not equal to zero, the security manager's
    `checkConnect` method is called with the hostname and `-1`
    as its arguments to determine if the operation is allowed.

    Parameters:
    :   `host` - the name of the host, or `null`.

    Returns:
    :   an array of all the IP addresses for a given host name.

    Throws:
    :   `UnknownHostException` - if no IP address for the
        `host` could be found, or if a scope\_id was specified
        for a global IPv6 address.
    :   `SecurityException` - if a security manager exists and its
        `checkConnect` method doesn't allow the operation.

  + ### getLoopbackAddress

    public static [InetAddress](InetAddress.md "class in java.net") getLoopbackAddress()

    Returns the loopback address.

    The InetAddress returned will represent the IPv4
    loopback address, 127.0.0.1, or the IPv6 loopback
    address, ::1. The IPv4 loopback address returned
    is only one of many in the form 127.\*.\*.\*

    Returns:
    :   the InetAddress loopback instance.

    Since:
    :   1.7
  + ### getByAddress

    public static [InetAddress](InetAddress.md "class in java.net") getByAddress(byte[] addr)
    throws [UnknownHostException](UnknownHostException.md "class in java.net")

    Returns an `InetAddress` object given the raw IP address .
    The argument is in network byte order: the highest order
    byte of the address is in `getAddress()[0]`.

    This method doesn't block, i.e. no reverse lookup is performed.

    IPv4 address byte array must be 4 bytes long and IPv6 byte array
    must be 16 bytes long

    Parameters:
    :   `addr` - the raw IP address in network byte order

    Returns:
    :   an InetAddress object created from the raw IP address.

    Throws:
    :   `UnknownHostException` - if IP address is of illegal length

    Since:
    :   1.4
  + ### getLocalHost

    public static [InetAddress](InetAddress.md "class in java.net") getLocalHost()
    throws [UnknownHostException](UnknownHostException.md "class in java.net")

    Returns the address of the local host. This is achieved by retrieving
    the name of the host from the system, then resolving that name into
    an `InetAddress`.

    Note: The resolved address may be cached for a short period of time.

    If there is a security manager, its
    `checkConnect` method is called
    with the local host name and `-1`
    as its arguments to see if the operation is allowed.
    If the operation is not allowed, an InetAddress representing
    the loopback address is returned.

    Returns:
    :   the address of the local host.

    Throws:
    :   `UnknownHostException` - if the local host name could not
        be resolved into an address.
