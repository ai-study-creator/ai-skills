public interface AsynchronousByteChannel
extends [AsynchronousChannel](AsynchronousChannel.md "interface in java.nio.channels")

An asynchronous channel that can read and write bytes.

Some channels may not allow more than one read or write to be outstanding
at any given time. If a thread invokes a read method before a previous read
operation has completed then a [`ReadPendingException`](ReadPendingException.md "class in java.nio.channels") will be thrown.
Similarly, if a write method is invoked before a previous write has completed
then [`WritePendingException`](WritePendingException.md "class in java.nio.channels") is thrown. Whether or not other kinds of
I/O operations may proceed concurrently with a read operation depends upon
the type of the channel.

Note that [`ByteBuffers`](../ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") are not safe for use by
multiple concurrent threads. When a read or write operation is initiated then
care must be taken to ensure that the buffer is not accessed until the
operation completes.

  + ### read

    <A> void read([ByteBuffer](../ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") dst,
    A attachment,
    [CompletionHandler](CompletionHandler.md "interface in java.nio.channels")<[Integer](../../lang/Integer.md "class in java.lang"),? super A> handler)

    Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer.

    This method initiates an asynchronous read operation to read a
    sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer. The `handler` parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when the read
    operation completes (or fails). The result passed to the completion
    handler is the number of bytes read or `-1` if no bytes could be
    read because the channel has reached end-of-stream.

    The read operation may read up to *r* bytes from the channel,
    where *r* is the number of bytes remaining in the buffer, that is,
    `dst.remaining()` at the time that the read is attempted. Where
    *r* is 0, the read operation completes immediately with a result of
    `0` without initiating an I/O operation.

    Suppose that a byte sequence of length *n* is read, where
    `0` `<` *n* `<=` *r*.
    This byte sequence will be transferred into the buffer so that the first
    byte in the sequence is at index *p* and the last byte is at index
    *p* `+` *n* `-` `1`,
    where *p* is the buffer's position at the moment the read is
    performed. Upon completion the buffer's position will be equal to
    *p* `+` *n*; its limit will not have changed.

    Buffers are not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads so care
    should be taken to not access the buffer until the operation has
    completed.

    This method may be invoked at any time. Some channel types may not
    allow more than one read to be outstanding at any given time. If a thread
    initiates a read operation before a previous read operation has
    completed then a [`ReadPendingException`](ReadPendingException.md "class in java.nio.channels") will be thrown.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `A` - The type of the attachment

    Parameters:
    :   `dst` - The buffer into which bytes are to be transferred
    :   `attachment` - The object to attach to the I/O operation; can be `null`
    :   `handler` - The completion handler

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - If the buffer is read-only
    :   `ReadPendingException` - If the channel does not allow more than one read to be outstanding
        and a previous read has not completed
    :   `ShutdownChannelGroupException` - If the channel is associated with a [`group`](AsynchronousChannelGroup.md "class in java.nio.channels") that has terminated
  + ### read

    [Future](../../util/concurrent/Future.md "interface in java.util.concurrent")<[Integer](../../lang/Integer.md "class in java.lang")> read([ByteBuffer](../ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") dst)

    Reads a sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer.

    This method initiates an asynchronous read operation to read a
    sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer. The method
    behaves in exactly the same manner as the [`read(ByteBuffer,Object,CompletionHandler)`](#read(java.nio.ByteBuffer,A,java.nio.channels.CompletionHandler)) method except that instead
    of specifying a completion handler, this method returns a `Future`
    representing the pending result. The `Future`'s [`get`](../../util/concurrent/Future.md#get()) method returns the number of bytes read or `-1` if no bytes
    could be read because the channel has reached end-of-stream.

    Parameters:
    :   `dst` - The buffer into which bytes are to be transferred

    Returns:
    :   A Future representing the result of the operation

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - If the buffer is read-only
    :   `ReadPendingException` - If the channel does not allow more than one read to be outstanding
        and a previous read has not completed
  + ### write

    <A> void write([ByteBuffer](../ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") src,
    A attachment,
    [CompletionHandler](CompletionHandler.md "interface in java.nio.channels")<[Integer](../../lang/Integer.md "class in java.lang"),? super A> handler)

    Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer.

    This method initiates an asynchronous write operation to write a
    sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer. The `handler` parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when the write
    operation completes (or fails). The result passed to the completion
    handler is the number of bytes written.

    The write operation may write up to *r* bytes to the channel,
    where *r* is the number of bytes remaining in the buffer, that is,
    `src.remaining()` at the time that the write is attempted. Where
    *r* is 0, the write operation completes immediately with a result of
    `0` without initiating an I/O operation.

    Suppose that a byte sequence of length *n* is written, where
    `0` `<` *n* `<=` *r*.
    This byte sequence will be transferred from the buffer starting at index
    *p*, where *p* is the buffer's position at the moment the
    write is performed; the index of the last byte written will be
    *p* `+` *n* `-` `1`.
    Upon completion the buffer's position will be equal to
    *p* `+` *n*; its limit will not have changed.

    Buffers are not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads so care
    should be taken to not access the buffer until the operation has
    completed.

    This method may be invoked at any time. Some channel types may not
    allow more than one write to be outstanding at any given time. If a thread
    initiates a write operation before a previous write operation has
    completed then a [`WritePendingException`](WritePendingException.md "class in java.nio.channels") will be thrown.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `A` - The type of the attachment

    Parameters:
    :   `src` - The buffer from which bytes are to be retrieved
    :   `attachment` - The object to attach to the I/O operation; can be `null`
    :   `handler` - The completion handler object

    Throws:
    :   `WritePendingException` - If the channel does not allow more than one write to be outstanding
        and a previous write has not completed
    :   `ShutdownChannelGroupException` - If the channel is associated with a [`group`](AsynchronousChannelGroup.md "class in java.nio.channels") that has terminated
  + ### write

    [Future](../../util/concurrent/Future.md "interface in java.util.concurrent")<[Integer](../../lang/Integer.md "class in java.lang")> write([ByteBuffer](../ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") src)

    Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer.

    This method initiates an asynchronous write operation to write a
    sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer. The method
    behaves in exactly the same manner as the [`write(ByteBuffer,Object,CompletionHandler)`](#write(java.nio.ByteBuffer,A,java.nio.channels.CompletionHandler)) method except that instead
    of specifying a completion handler, this method returns a `Future`
    representing the pending result. The `Future`'s [`get`](../../util/concurrent/Future.md#get()) method returns the number of bytes written.

    Parameters:
    :   `src` - The buffer from which bytes are to be retrieved

    Returns:
    :   A Future representing the result of the operation

    Throws:
    :   `WritePendingException` - If the channel does not allow more than one write to be outstanding
        and a previous write has not completed
