public abstract sealed class FloatBuffer
extends [Buffer](Buffer.md "class in java.nio")
implements [Comparable](../lang/Comparable.md "interface in java.lang")<[FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio")>

A float buffer.

This class defines four categories of operations upon
float buffers:

* Absolute and relative [`get`](#get()) and
  [`put`](#put(float)) methods that read and write
  single floats;
* Absolute and relative [`bulk get`](#get(float%5B%5D))
  methods that transfer contiguous sequences of floats from this buffer
  into an array;
* Absolute and relative [`bulk put`](#put(float%5B%5D))
  methods that transfer contiguous sequences of floats from a
  float array or some other float
  buffer into this buffer;
* A method for [`compacting`](#compact())
  a float buffer.

Float buffers can be created either by [`allocation`](#allocate(int)), which allocates space for the buffer's
content, by [`wrapping`](#wrap(float%5B%5D)) an existing
float array into a buffer, or by creating a
[*view*](ByteBuffer.md#views) of an existing byte buffer.

Like a byte buffer, a float buffer is either [*direct* or *non-direct*](ByteBuffer.md#direct). A
float buffer created via the `wrap` methods of this class will
be non-direct. A float buffer created as a view of a byte buffer will
be direct if, and only if, the byte buffer itself is direct. Whether or not
a float buffer is direct may be determined by invoking the [`isDirect`](#isDirect()) method.

Methods in this class that do not otherwise have a value to return are
specified to return the buffer upon which they are invoked. This allows
method invocations to be chained.

## Optional operations

Methods specified as
*[optional
operations](Buffer.md#read-only-buffers-heading)* throw a [ReadOnlyBufferException](ReadOnlyBufferException.md "class in java.nio") when invoked
on a [read-only](Buffer.md#isReadOnly()) FloatBuffer. The
methods [array](#array()) and [arrayOffset](#arrayOffset())
throw an [UnsupportedOperationException](../lang/UnsupportedOperationException.md "class in java.lang") if the FloatBuffer is
not backed by an [accessible float array](Buffer.md#hasArray())
(irrespective of whether the FloatBuffer is read-only).

  + ### allocate

    public static [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") allocate(int capacity)

    Allocates a new float buffer.

    The new buffer's position will be zero, its limit will be its
    capacity, its mark will be undefined, each of its elements will be
    initialized to zero, and its byte order will be
    the [`native order`](ByteOrder.md#nativeOrder()) of the underlying
    hardware.
    It will have a [`backing array`](#array()), and its
    [`array offset`](#arrayOffset()) will be zero.

    Parameters:
    :   `capacity` - The new buffer's capacity, in floats

    Returns:
    :   The new float buffer

    public static [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") wrap(float[] array,
    int offset,
    int length)

    Wraps a float array into a buffer.

    The new buffer will be backed by the given float array;
    that is, modifications to the buffer will cause the array to be modified
    and vice versa. The new buffer's capacity will be
    `array.length`, its position will be `offset`, its limit
    will be `offset + length`, its mark will be undefined, and its
    byte order will be
    the [`native order`](ByteOrder.md#nativeOrder()) of the underlying
    hardware.
    Its [`backing array`](#array()) will be the given array, and
    its [`array offset`](#arrayOffset()) will be zero.

    Parameters:
    :   `array` - The array that will back the new buffer
    :   `offset` - The offset of the subarray to be used; must be non-negative and
        no larger than `array.length`. The new buffer's position
        will be set to this value.
    :   `length` - The length of the subarray to be used;
        must be non-negative and no larger than
        `array.length - offset`.
        The new buffer's limit will be set to `offset + length`.

    Returns:
    :   The new float buffer

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If the preconditions on the `offset` and `length`
        parameters do not hold
  + ### wrap

    public static [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") wrap(float[] array)

    Wraps a float array into a buffer.

    The new buffer will be backed by the given float array;
    that is, modifications to the buffer will cause the array to be modified
    and vice versa. The new buffer's capacity and limit will be
    `array.length`, its position will be zero, its mark will be
    undefined, and its byte order will be
    the [`native order`](ByteOrder.md#nativeOrder()) of the underlying
    hardware.
    Its [`backing array`](#array()) will be the given array, and its
    [`array offset`](#arrayOffset()) will be zero.

    Parameters:
    :   `array` - The array that will back this buffer

    Returns:
    :   The new float buffer
  + ### slice

    public abstract [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") slice()

    Creates a new float buffer whose content is a shared subsequence of
    this buffer's content.

    The content of the new buffer will start at this buffer's current
    position. Changes to this buffer's content will be visible in the new
    buffer, and vice versa; the two buffers' position, limit, and mark
    values will be independent.

    The new buffer's position will be zero, its capacity and its limit
    will be the number of floats remaining in this buffer, its mark will be
    undefined, and its byte order will be
    identical to that of this buffer.
    The new buffer will be direct if, and only if, this buffer is direct, and
    it will be read-only if, and only if, this buffer is read-only.

    Specified by:
    :   `slice` in class `Buffer`

    Returns:
    :   The new float buffer
  + ### slice

    public abstract [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") slice(int index,
    int length)

    Creates a new float buffer whose content is a shared subsequence of
    this buffer's content.

    The content of the new buffer will start at position `index`
    in this buffer, and will contain `length` elements. Changes to
    this buffer's content will be visible in the new buffer, and vice versa;
    the two buffers' position, limit, and mark values will be independent.

    The new buffer's position will be zero, its capacity and its limit
    will be `length`, its mark will be undefined, and its byte order
    will be
    identical to that of this buffer.
    The new buffer will be direct if, and only if, this buffer is direct,
    and it will be read-only if, and only if, this buffer is read-only.

    Specified by:
    :   `slice` in class `Buffer`

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - The position in this buffer at which the content of the new
        buffer will start; must be non-negative and no larger than
        [`limit()`](Buffer.md#limit())
    :   `length` - The number of elements the new buffer will contain; must be
        non-negative and no larger than `limit() - index`

    Returns:
    :   The new buffer

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If `index` is negative or greater than `limit()`,
        `length` is negative, or `length > limit() - index`

    Since:
    :   13
  + ### duplicate

    public abstract [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") duplicate()

    Creates a new float buffer that shares this buffer's content.

    The content of the new buffer will be that of this buffer. Changes
    to this buffer's content will be visible in the new buffer, and vice
    versa; the two buffers' position, limit, and mark values will be
    independent.

    The new buffer's capacity, limit, position,
    mark values, and byte order will be identical to those of this buffer.
    The new buffer will be direct if, and only if, this buffer is direct, and
    it will be read-only if, and only if, this buffer is read-only.

    Specified by:
    :   `duplicate` in class `Buffer`

    Returns:
    :   The new float buffer
  + ### asReadOnlyBuffer

    public abstract [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") asReadOnlyBuffer()

    Creates a new, read-only float buffer that shares this buffer's
    content.

    The content of the new buffer will be that of this buffer. Changes
    to this buffer's content will be visible in the new buffer; the new
    buffer itself, however, will be read-only and will not allow the shared
    content to be modified. The two buffers' position, limit, and mark
    values will be independent.

    The new buffer's capacity, limit, position,
    mark values, and byte order will be identical to those of this buffer.

    If this buffer is itself read-only then this method behaves in
    exactly the same way as the [`duplicate`](#duplicate()) method.

    Returns:
    :   The new, read-only float buffer
  + ### get

    public abstract float get()

    Relative *get* method. Reads the float at this buffer's
    current position, and then increments the position.

    Returns:
    :   The float at the buffer's current position

    Throws:
    :   `BufferUnderflowException` - If the buffer's current position is not smaller than its limit
  + ### put

    public abstract [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") put(float f)

    Relative *put* method  *(optional operation)*.

    Writes the given float into this buffer at the current
    position, and then increments the position.

    Parameters:
    :   `f` - The float to be written

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Throws:
    :   `BufferOverflowException` - If this buffer's current position is not smaller than its limit
    :   `ReadOnlyBufferException` - If this buffer is read-only
  + ### get

    public abstract float get(int index)

    Absolute *get* method. Reads the float at the given
    index.

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - The index from which the float will be read

    Returns:
    :   The float at the given index

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If `index` is negative
        or not smaller than the buffer's limit
  + ### put

    public abstract [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") put(int index,
    float f)

    Absolute *put* method  *(optional operation)*.

    Writes the given float into this buffer at the given
    index.

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - The index at which the float will be written
    :   `f` - The float value to be written

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If `index` is negative
        or not smaller than the buffer's limit
    :   `ReadOnlyBufferException` - If this buffer is read-only
  + ### get

    public [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") get(float[] dst,
    int offset,
    int length)

    Relative bulk *get* method.

    This method transfers floats from this buffer into the given
    destination array. If there are fewer floats remaining in the
    buffer than are required to satisfy the request, that is, if
    `length` `>` `remaining()`, then no
    floats are transferred and a [`BufferUnderflowException`](BufferUnderflowException.md "class in java.nio") is
    thrown.

    Otherwise, this method copies `length` floats from this
    buffer into the given array, starting at the current position of this
    buffer and at the given offset in the array. The position of this
    buffer is then incremented by `length`.

    In other words, an invocation of this method of the form
    `src.get(dst, off, len)` has exactly the same effect as
    the loop

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        for (int i = off; i < off + len; i++)
            dst[i] = src.get();
    ```

    except that it first checks that there are sufficient floats in
    this buffer and it is potentially much more efficient.

    Parameters:
    :   `dst` - The array into which floats are to be written
    :   `offset` - The offset within the array of the first float to be
        written; must be non-negative and no larger than
        `dst.length`
    :   `length` - The maximum number of floats to be written to the given
        array; must be non-negative and no larger than
        `dst.length - offset`

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Throws:
    :   `BufferUnderflowException` - If there are fewer than `length` floats
        remaining in this buffer
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If the preconditions on the `offset` and `length`
        parameters do not hold
  + ### get

    public [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") get(float[] dst)

    Relative bulk *get* method.

    This method transfers floats from this buffer into the given
    destination array. An invocation of this method of the form
    `src.get(a)` behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        src.get(a, 0, a.length)
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `dst` - The destination array

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Throws:
    :   `BufferUnderflowException` - If there are fewer than `length` floats
        remaining in this buffer
  + ### get

    public [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") get(int index,
    float[] dst,
    int offset,
    int length)

    Absolute bulk *get* method.

    This method transfers `length` floats from this
    buffer into the given array, starting at the given index in this
    buffer and at the given offset in the array. The position of this
    buffer is unchanged.

    An invocation of this method of the form
    `src.get(index, dst, offset, length)`
    has exactly the same effect as the following loop except that it first
    checks the consistency of the supplied parameters and it is potentially
    much more efficient:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        for (int i = offset, j = index; i < offset + length; i++, j++)
            dst[i] = src.get(j);
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - The index in this buffer from which the first float will be
        read; must be non-negative and less than `limit()`
    :   `dst` - The destination array
    :   `offset` - The offset within the array of the first float to be
        written; must be non-negative and less than
        `dst.length`
    :   `length` - The number of floats to be written to the given array;
        must be non-negative and no larger than the smaller of
        `limit() - index` and `dst.length - offset`

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If the preconditions on the `index`, `offset`, and
        `length` parameters do not hold

    Since:
    :   13
  + ### get

    public [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") get(int index,
    float[] dst)

    Absolute bulk *get* method.

    This method transfers floats from this buffer into the given
    destination array. The position of this buffer is unchanged. An
    invocation of this method of the form
    `src.get(index, dst)` behaves in exactly the same
    way as the invocation:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        src.get(index, dst, 0, dst.length)
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - The index in this buffer from which the first float will be
        read; must be non-negative and less than `limit()`
    :   `dst` - The destination array

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If `index` is negative, not smaller than `limit()`,
        or `limit() - index < dst.length`

    Since:
    :   13
  + ### put

    public [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") put([FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") src)

    Relative bulk *put* method  *(optional operation)*.

    This method transfers the floats remaining in the given source
    buffer into this buffer. If there are more floats remaining in the
    source buffer than in this buffer, that is, if
    `src.remaining()` `>` `remaining()`,
    then no floats are transferred and a [`BufferOverflowException`](BufferOverflowException.md "class in java.nio") is thrown.

    Otherwise, this method copies
    *n* = `src.remaining()` floats from the given
    buffer into this buffer, starting at each buffer's current position.
    The positions of both buffers are then incremented by *n*.

    In other words, an invocation of this method of the form
    `dst.put(src)` has exactly the same effect as the loop

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        while (src.hasRemaining())
            dst.put(src.get());
    ```

    except that it first checks that there is sufficient space in this
    buffer and it is potentially much more efficient. If this buffer and
    the source buffer share the same backing array or memory, then the
    result will be as if the source elements were first copied to an
    intermediate location before being written into this buffer.

    Parameters:
    :   `src` - The source buffer from which floats are to be read;
        must not be this buffer

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Throws:
    :   `BufferOverflowException` - If there is insufficient space in this buffer
        for the remaining floats in the source buffer
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - If the source buffer is this buffer
    :   `ReadOnlyBufferException` - If this buffer is read-only
  + ### put

    public [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") put(int index,
    [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") src,
    int offset,
    int length)

    Absolute bulk *put* method  *(optional operation)*.

    This method transfers `length` floats into this buffer from
    the given source buffer, starting at the given `offset` in the
    source buffer and the given `index` in this buffer. The positions
    of both buffers are unchanged.

    In other words, an invocation of this method of the form
    `dst.put(index, src, offset, length)`
    has exactly the same effect as the loop

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        for (int i = offset, j = index; i < offset + length; i++, j++)
            dst.put(j, src.get(i));
    ```

    except that it first checks the consistency of the supplied parameters
    and it is potentially much more efficient. If this buffer and
    the source buffer share the same backing array or memory, then the
    result will be as if the source elements were first copied to an
    intermediate location before being written into this buffer.

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - The index in this buffer at which the first float will be
        written; must be non-negative and less than `limit()`
    :   `src` - The buffer from which floats are to be read
    :   `offset` - The index within the source buffer of the first float to be
        read; must be non-negative and less than `src.limit()`
    :   `length` - The number of floats to be read from the given buffer;
        must be non-negative and no larger than the smaller of
        `limit() - index` and `src.limit() - offset`

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If the preconditions on the `index`, `offset`, and
        `length` parameters do not hold
    :   `ReadOnlyBufferException` - If this buffer is read-only

    Since:
    :   16
  + ### put

    public [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") put(float[] src,
    int offset,
    int length)

    Relative bulk *put* method  *(optional operation)*.

    This method transfers floats into this buffer from the given
    source array. If there are more floats to be copied from the array
    than remain in this buffer, that is, if
    `length` `>` `remaining()`, then no
    floats are transferred and a [`BufferOverflowException`](BufferOverflowException.md "class in java.nio") is
    thrown.

    Otherwise, this method copies `length` floats from the
    given array into this buffer, starting at the given offset in the array
    and at the current position of this buffer. The position of this buffer
    is then incremented by `length`.

    In other words, an invocation of this method of the form
    `dst.put(src, off, len)` has exactly the same effect as
    the loop

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        for (int i = off; i < off + len; i++)
            dst.put(src[i]);
    ```

    except that it first checks that there is sufficient space in this
    buffer and it is potentially much more efficient.

    Parameters:
    :   `src` - The array from which floats are to be read
    :   `offset` - The offset within the array of the first float to be read;
        must be non-negative and no larger than `src.length`
    :   `length` - The number of floats to be read from the given array;
        must be non-negative and no larger than
        `src.length - offset`

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Throws:
    :   `BufferOverflowException` - If there is insufficient space in this buffer
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If the preconditions on the `offset` and `length`
        parameters do not hold
    :   `ReadOnlyBufferException` - If this buffer is read-only
  + ### put

    public final [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") put(float[] src)

    Relative bulk *put* method  *(optional operation)*.

    This method transfers the entire content of the given source
    float array into this buffer. An invocation of this method of the
    form `dst.put(a)` behaves in exactly the same way as the
    invocation

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        dst.put(a, 0, a.length)
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `src` - The source array

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Throws:
    :   `BufferOverflowException` - If there is insufficient space in this buffer
    :   `ReadOnlyBufferException` - If this buffer is read-only
  + ### put

    public [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") put(int index,
    float[] src,
    int offset,
    int length)

    Absolute bulk *put* method  *(optional operation)*.

    This method transfers `length` floats from the given
    array, starting at the given offset in the array and at the given index
    in this buffer. The position of this buffer is unchanged.

    An invocation of this method of the form
    `dst.put(index, src, offset, length)`
    has exactly the same effect as the following loop except that it first
    checks the consistency of the supplied parameters and it is potentially
    much more efficient:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        for (int i = offset, j = index; i < offset + length; i++, j++)
            dst.put(j, src[i]);
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - The index in this buffer at which the first float will be
        written; must be non-negative and less than `limit()`
    :   `src` - The array from which floats are to be read
    :   `offset` - The offset within the array of the first float to be read;
        must be non-negative and less than `src.length`
    :   `length` - The number of floats to be read from the given array;
        must be non-negative and no larger than the smaller of
        `limit() - index` and `src.length - offset`

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If the preconditions on the `index`, `offset`, and
        `length` parameters do not hold
    :   `ReadOnlyBufferException` - If this buffer is read-only

    Since:
    :   13
  + ### put

    public [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") put(int index,
    float[] src)

    Absolute bulk *put* method  *(optional operation)*.

    This method copies floats into this buffer from the given source
    array. The position of this buffer is unchanged. An invocation of this
    method of the form `dst.put(index, src)`
    behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        dst.put(index, src, 0, src.length);
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - The index in this buffer at which the first float will be
        written; must be non-negative and less than `limit()`
    :   `src` - The array from which floats are to be read

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - If `index` is negative, not smaller than `limit()`,
        or `limit() - index < src.length`
    :   `ReadOnlyBufferException` - If this buffer is read-only

    Since:
    :   13
  + ### hasArray

    public final boolean hasArray()

    Tells whether or not this buffer is backed by an accessible float
    array.

    If this method returns `true` then the [`array`](#array())
    and [`arrayOffset`](#arrayOffset()) methods may safely be invoked.

    Specified by:
    :   `hasArray` in class `Buffer`

    Returns:
    :   `true` if, and only if, this buffer
        is backed by an array and is not read-only
  + ### array

    public final float[] array()

    Returns the float array that backs this
    buffer  *(optional operation)*.

    Modifications to this buffer's content will cause the returned
    array's content to be modified, and vice versa.

    Invoke the [`hasArray`](#hasArray()) method before invoking this
    method in order to ensure that this buffer has an accessible backing
    array.

    Specified by:
    :   `array` in class `Buffer`

    Returns:
    :   The array that backs this buffer

    Throws:
    :   `ReadOnlyBufferException` - If this buffer is backed by an array but is read-only
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - If this buffer is not backed by an accessible array
  + ### arrayOffset

    public final int arrayOffset()

    Returns the offset within this buffer's backing array of the first
    element of the buffer  *(optional operation)*.

    If this buffer is backed by an array then buffer position *p*
    corresponds to array index *p* + `arrayOffset()`.

    Invoke the [`hasArray`](#hasArray()) method before invoking this
    method in order to ensure that this buffer has an accessible backing
    array.

    Specified by:
    :   `arrayOffset` in class `Buffer`

    Returns:
    :   The offset within this buffer's array
        of the first element of the buffer

    Throws:
    :   `ReadOnlyBufferException` - If this buffer is backed by an array but is read-only
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - If this buffer is not backed by an accessible array
  + ### position

    public final [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") position(int newPosition)

    Sets this buffer's position. If the mark is defined and larger than the
    new position then it is discarded.

    Overrides:
    :   `position` in class `Buffer`

    Parameters:
    :   `newPosition` - The new position value; must be non-negative
        and no larger than the current limit

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### limit

    public final [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") limit(int newLimit)

    Sets this buffer's limit. If the position is larger than the new limit
    then it is set to the new limit. If the mark is defined and larger than
    the new limit then it is discarded.

    Overrides:
    :   `limit` in class `Buffer`

    Parameters:
    :   `newLimit` - The new limit value; must be non-negative
        and no larger than this buffer's capacity

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### mark

    public final [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") mark()

    Sets this buffer's mark at its position.

    Overrides:
    :   `mark` in class `Buffer`

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### reset

    public final [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") reset()

    Resets this buffer's position to the previously-marked position.

    Invoking this method neither changes nor discards the mark's
    value.

    Overrides:
    :   `reset` in class `Buffer`

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### clear

    public final [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") clear()

    Clears this buffer. The position is set to zero, the limit is set to
    the capacity, and the mark is discarded.

    Invoke this method before using a sequence of channel-read or
    *put* operations to fill this buffer. For example:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        buf.clear();     // Prepare buffer for reading
        in.read(buf);    // Read data
    ```

    This method does not actually erase the data in the buffer, but it
    is named as if it did because it will most often be used in situations
    in which that might as well be the case.

    Overrides:
    :   `clear` in class `Buffer`

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### flip

    public final [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") flip()

    Flips this buffer. The limit is set to the current position and then
    the position is set to zero. If the mark is defined then it is
    discarded.

    After a sequence of channel-read or *put* operations, invoke
    this method to prepare for a sequence of channel-write or relative
    *get* operations. For example:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        buf.put(magic);    // Prepend header
        in.read(buf);      // Read data into rest of buffer
        buf.flip();        // Flip buffer
        out.write(buf);    // Write header + data to channel
    ```

    This method is often used in conjunction with the [`compact`](ByteBuffer.md#compact()) method when transferring data from
    one place to another.

    Overrides:
    :   `flip` in class `Buffer`

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### rewind

    public final [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") rewind()

    Rewinds this buffer. The position is set to zero and the mark is
    discarded.

    Invoke this method before a sequence of channel-write or *get*
    operations, assuming that the limit has already been set
    appropriately. For example:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        out.write(buf);    // Write remaining data
        buf.rewind();      // Rewind buffer
        buf.get(array);    // Copy data into array
    ```

    Overrides:
    :   `rewind` in class `Buffer`

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### compact

    public abstract [FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") compact()

    Compacts this buffer  *(optional operation)*.

    The floats between the buffer's current position and its limit,
    if any, are copied to the beginning of the buffer. That is, the
    float at index *p* = `position()` is copied
    to index zero, the float at index *p* + 1 is copied
    to index one, and so forth until the float at index
    `limit()` - 1 is copied to index
    *n* = `limit()` - `1` - *p*.
    The buffer's position is then set to *n+1* and its limit is set to
    its capacity. The mark, if defined, is discarded.

    The buffer's position is set to the number of floats copied,
    rather than to zero, so that an invocation of this method can be
    followed immediately by an invocation of another relative *put*
    method.

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Throws:
    :   `ReadOnlyBufferException` - If this buffer is read-only
  + ### isDirect

    public abstract boolean isDirect()

    Tells whether or not this float buffer is direct.

    Specified by:
    :   `isDirect` in class `Buffer`

    Returns:
    :   `true` if, and only if, this buffer is direct
  + ### toString

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Returns a string summarizing the state of this buffer.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   A summary string
  + ### hashCode

    public int hashCode()

    Returns the current hash code of this buffer.

    The hash code of a float buffer depends only upon its remaining
    elements; that is, upon the elements from `position()` up to, and
    including, the element at `limit()` - `1`.

    Because buffer hash codes are content-dependent, it is inadvisable
    to use buffers as keys in hash maps or similar data structures unless it
    is known that their contents will not change.

    Overrides:
    :   `hashCode` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   The current hash code of this buffer

    See Also:
    :   - [`Object.equals(java.lang.Object)`](../lang/Object.md#equals(java.lang.Object))
        - [`System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)`](../lang/System.md#identityHashCode(java.lang.Object))
  + ### equals

    public boolean equals([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") ob)

    Tells whether or not this buffer is equal to another object.

    Two float buffers are equal if, and only if,
    1. They have the same element type,
    2. They have the same number of remaining elements, and
    3. The two sequences of remaining elements, considered
       independently of their starting positions, are pointwise equal.
       This method considers two float elements `a` and `b`
       to be equal if
       `(a == b) || (Float.isNaN(a) && Float.isNaN(b))`.
       The values `-0.0` and `+0.0` are considered to be
       equal, unlike [`Float.equals(Object)`](../lang/Float.md#equals(java.lang.Object)).

    A float buffer is not equal to any other type of object.

    Overrides:
    :   `equals` in class `Object`

    Parameters:
    :   `ob` - The object to which this buffer is to be compared

    Returns:
    :   `true` if, and only if, this buffer is equal to the
        given object

    See Also:
    :   - [`Object.hashCode()`](../lang/Object.md#hashCode())
        - [`HashMap`](../util/HashMap.md "class in java.util")
  + ### compareTo

    public int compareTo([FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") that)

    Compares this buffer to another.

    Two float buffers are compared by comparing their sequences of
    remaining elements lexicographically, without regard to the starting
    position of each sequence within its corresponding buffer.
    Pairs of `float` elements are compared as if by invoking
    [`Float.compare(float,float)`](../lang/Float.md#compare(float,float)), except that
    `-0.0` and `0.0` are considered to be equal.
    `Float.NaN` is considered by this method to be equal
    to itself and greater than all other `float` values
    (including `Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY`).

    A float buffer is not comparable to any other type of object.

    Specified by:
    :   `compareTo` in interface `Comparable<FloatBuffer>`

    Parameters:
    :   `that` - the object to be compared.

    Returns:
    :   A negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this buffer
        is less than, equal to, or greater than the given buffer
  + ### mismatch

    public int mismatch([FloatBuffer](FloatBuffer.md "class in java.nio") that)

    Finds and returns the relative index of the first mismatch between this
    buffer and a given buffer. The index is relative to the
    [`position`](Buffer.md#position()) of each buffer and will be in the range of
    0 (inclusive) up to the smaller of the [`remaining`](Buffer.md#remaining())
    elements in each buffer (exclusive).

    If the two buffers share a common prefix then the returned index is
    the length of the common prefix and it follows that there is a mismatch
    between the two buffers at that index within the respective buffers.
    If one buffer is a proper prefix of the other then the returned index is
    the smaller of the remaining elements in each buffer, and it follows that
    the index is only valid for the buffer with the larger number of
    remaining elements.
    Otherwise, there is no mismatch.

    Parameters:
    :   `that` - The byte buffer to be tested for a mismatch with this buffer

    Returns:
    :   The relative index of the first mismatch between this and the
        given buffer, otherwise -1 if no mismatch.

    Since:
    :   11
  + ### order

    public abstract [ByteOrder](ByteOrder.md "class in java.nio") order()

    Retrieves this buffer's byte order.

    The byte order of a float buffer created by allocation or by
    wrapping an existing `float` array is the [`native order`](ByteOrder.md#nativeOrder()) of the underlying
    hardware. The byte order of a float buffer created as a [view](ByteBuffer.md#views) of a byte buffer is that of the
    byte buffer at the moment that the view is created.

    Returns:
    :   This buffer's byte order
