# Class FileStore

[java.lang.Object](../../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

java.nio.file.FileStore

---

public abstract class FileStore
extends [Object](../../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

Storage for files. A `FileStore` represents a storage pool, device,
partition, volume, concrete file system or other implementation specific means
of file storage. The `FileStore` for where a file is stored is obtained
by invoking the [`getFileStore`](Files.md#getFileStore(java.nio.file.Path)) method, or all file
stores can be enumerated by invoking the [`getFileStores`](FileSystem.md#getFileStores()) method.

In addition to the methods defined by this class, a file store may support
one or more [`FileStoreAttributeView`](attribute/FileStoreAttributeView.md "interface in java.nio.file.attribute") classes
that provide a read-only or updatable view of a set of file store attributes.

* ## Method Details

  + ### name

    public abstract [String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name()

    Returns the name of this file store. The format of the name is highly
    implementation specific. It will typically be the name of the storage
    pool or volume.

    The string returned by this method may differ from the string
    returned by the [`toString`](../../lang/Object.md#toString()) method.

    Returns:
    :   the name of this file store
  + ### type

    public abstract [String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") type()

    Returns the *type* of this file store. The format of the string
    returned by this method is highly implementation specific. It may
    indicate, for example, the format used or if the file store is local
    or remote.

    Returns:
    :   a string representing the type of this file store
  + ### isReadOnly

    public abstract boolean isReadOnly()

    Tells whether this file store is read-only. A file store is read-only if
    it does not support write operations or other changes to files. Any
    attempt to create a file, open an existing file for writing etc. causes
    an `IOException` to be thrown.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if, and only if, this file store is read-only
  + ### getTotalSpace

    public abstract long getTotalSpace()
    throws [IOException](../../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Returns the size, in bytes, of the file store. If the total number of
    bytes in the file store is greater than [`Long.MAX_VALUE`](../../lang/Long.md#MAX_VALUE), then
    `Long.MAX_VALUE` will be returned.

    Returns:
    :   the size of the file store, in bytes

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs
  + ### getUsableSpace

    public abstract long getUsableSpace()
    throws [IOException](../../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Returns the number of bytes available to this Java virtual machine on the
    file store. If the number of bytes available is greater than
    [`Long.MAX_VALUE`](../../lang/Long.md#MAX_VALUE), then `Long.MAX_VALUE` will be returned.

    The returned number of available bytes is a hint, but not a
    guarantee, that it is possible to use most or any of these bytes. The
    number of usable bytes is most likely to be accurate immediately
    after the space attributes are obtained. It is likely to be made inaccurate
    by any external I/O operations including those made on the system outside
    of this Java virtual machine.

    Returns:
    :   the number of bytes available

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs
  + ### getUnallocatedSpace

    public abstract long getUnallocatedSpace()
    throws [IOException](../../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Returns the number of unallocated bytes in the file store.
    If the number of unallocated bytes is greater than
    [`Long.MAX_VALUE`](../../lang/Long.md#MAX_VALUE), then `Long.MAX_VALUE` will be returned.

    The returned number of unallocated bytes is a hint, but not a
    guarantee, that it is possible to use most or any of these bytes. The
    number of unallocated bytes is most likely to be accurate immediately
    after the space attributes are obtained. It is likely to be
    made inaccurate by any external I/O operations including those made on
    the system outside of this virtual machine.

    Returns:
    :   the number of unallocated bytes

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs
  + ### getBlockSize

    public long getBlockSize()
    throws [IOException](../../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Returns the number of bytes per block in this file store.

    File storage is typically organized into discrete sequences of bytes
    called *blocks*. A block is the smallest storage unit of a file store.
    Every read and write operation is performed on a multiple of blocks.

    Returns:
    :   a positive value representing the block size of this file store,
        in bytes

    Throws:
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the operation is not supported

  + ### supportsFileAttributeView

    public abstract boolean supportsFileAttributeView([Class](../../lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<? extends [FileAttributeView](attribute/FileAttributeView.md "interface in java.nio.file.attribute")> type)

    Tells whether or not this file store supports the file attributes
    identified by the given file attribute view.

    Invoking this method to test if the file store supports [`BasicFileAttributeView`](attribute/BasicFileAttributeView.md "interface in java.nio.file.attribute") will always return `true`. In the case of
    the default provider, this method cannot guarantee to give the correct
    result when the file store is not a local storage device. The reasons for
    this are implementation specific and therefore unspecified.

    Parameters:
    :   `type` - the file attribute view type

    Returns:
    :   `true` if, and only if, the file attribute view is
        supported
  + ### supportsFileAttributeView

    public abstract boolean supportsFileAttributeView([String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name)

    Tells whether or not this file store supports the file attributes
    identified by the given file attribute view.

    Invoking this method to test if the file store supports [`BasicFileAttributeView`](attribute/BasicFileAttributeView.md "interface in java.nio.file.attribute"), identified by the name "`basic`" will
    always return `true`. In the case of the default provider, this
    method cannot guarantee to give the correct result when the file store is
    not a local storage device. The reasons for this are implementation
    specific and therefore unspecified.

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - the [`name`](attribute/AttributeView.md#name()) of file attribute view

    Returns:
    :   `true` if, and only if, the file attribute view is
        supported
  + ### getFileStoreAttributeView

    public abstract <V extends [FileStoreAttributeView](attribute/FileStoreAttributeView.md "interface in java.nio.file.attribute")>
    V getFileStoreAttributeView([Class](../../lang/Class.md "class in java.lang")<V> type)

    Returns a `FileStoreAttributeView` of the given type.

    This method is intended to be used where the file store attribute
    view defines type-safe methods to read or update the file store attributes.
    The `type` parameter is the type of the attribute view required and
    the method returns an instance of that type if supported.

    Type Parameters:
    :   `V` - The `FileStoreAttributeView` type

    Parameters:
    :   `type` - the `Class` object corresponding to the attribute view

    Returns:
    :   a file store attribute view of the specified type or
        `null` if the attribute view is not available
  + ### getAttribute

    public abstract [Object](../../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") getAttribute([String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") attribute)
    throws [IOException](../../io/IOException.md "class in java.io")

    Reads the value of a file store attribute.

    The `attribute` parameter identifies the attribute to be read
    and takes the form:
    > *view-name***:***attribute-name*

    where the character `':'` stands for itself.

    *view-name* is the [`name`](attribute/AttributeView.md#name()) of
    a [`AttributeView`](FileStore.md "class in java.nio.file") that identifies a set of file attributes.
    *attribute-name* is the name of the attribute.

    **Usage Example:**
    Suppose we want to know if ZFS compression is enabled (assuming the "zfs"
    view is supported):

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        boolean compression = (Boolean)fs.getAttribute("zfs:compression");
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `attribute` - the attribute to read

    Returns:
    :   the attribute value; `null` may be valid for some
        attributes

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - if the attribute view is not available or it does not support
        reading the attribute
    :   `IOException` - if an I/O error occurs
