# Package java.nio.file

---

package java.nio.file

Defines interfaces and classes for the Java virtual machine to access files,
file attributes, and file systems.

The java.nio.file package defines classes to access files and file
systems. The API to access file and file system attributes is defined in the
[`java.nio.file.attribute`](attribute/package-summary.md) package. The [`java.nio.file.spi`](spi/package-summary.md)
package is used by service provider implementors wishing to extend the
platform default provider, or to construct other provider implementations.

## Symbolic Links

Many operating systems and file systems have support for *symbolic links*.
A symbolic link is a special file that serves as a reference to another file.
For the most part, symbolic links are transparent to applications and
operations on symbolic links are automatically redirected to the *target*
of the link. Exceptions to this are when a symbolic link is deleted or
renamed/moved in which case the link is deleted or removed rather than the
target of the link. This package includes support for symbolic links where
implementations provide these semantics. File systems may support other types
that are semantically close but support for these other types of links is
not included in this package.

## Interoperability

The [`File`](../../io/File.md "class in java.io") class defines the [`toPath`](../../io/File.md#toPath()) method to construct a [`Path`](Path.md "interface in java.nio.file") by converting
the abstract path represented by the `java.io.File` object. The resulting
`Path` can be used to operate on the same file as the `File`
object. The `Path` specification provides further information
on the [interoperability](Path.md#interop) between `Path`
and `java.io.File` objects.

## Visibility

The view of the files and file system provided by classes in this package are
guaranteed to be consistent with other views provided by other instances in the
same Java virtual machine. The view may or may not, however, be consistent with
the view of the file system as seen by other concurrently running programs due
to caching performed by the underlying operating system and delays induced by
network-filesystem protocols. This is true regardless of the language in which
these other programs are written, and whether they are running on the same machine
or on some other machine. The exact nature of any such inconsistencies is
system-dependent and therefore unspecified.

## Synchronized I/O File Integrity

The [`SYNC`](StandardOpenOption.md#SYNC) and [`DSYNC`](StandardOpenOption.md#DSYNC) options are used when opening a file
to require that updates to the file are written synchronously to the underlying
storage device. In the case of the default provider, and the file resides on
a local storage device, and the [`seekable`](../channels/SeekableByteChannel.md "interface in java.nio.channels") channel is connected to a file that was opened with one of these
options, then an invocation of the [`write`](../channels/WritableByteChannel.md#write(java.nio.ByteBuffer))
method is only guaranteed to return when all changes made to the file
by that invocation have been written to the device. These options are useful
for ensuring that critical information is not lost in the event of a system
crash. If the file does not reside on a local device then no such guarantee
is made. Whether this guarantee is possible with other [`provider`](spi/FileSystemProvider.md "class in java.nio.file.spi") implementations is provider
specific.

## General Exceptions

Unless otherwise noted, passing a `null` argument to a constructor
or method of any class or interface in this package will cause a [`NullPointerException`](../../lang/NullPointerException.md "class in java.lang") to be thrown. Additionally,
invoking a method with an array or collection containing a `null` element
will cause a `NullPointerException`, unless otherwise specified.

Unless otherwise noted, methods that attempt to access the file system
will throw [`ClosedFileSystemException`](ClosedFileSystemException.md "class in java.nio.file") when invoked on
objects associated with a [`FileSystem`](FileSystem.md "class in java.nio.file") that has been
[`closed`](FileSystem.md#close()). Additionally, any methods
that attempt write access to a file system will throw [`ReadOnlyFileSystemException`](ReadOnlyFileSystemException.md "class in java.nio.file") when invoked on an object associated
with a [`FileSystem`](FileSystem.md "class in java.nio.file") that only provides read-only
access.

Unless otherwise noted, invoking a method of any class or interface in
this package created by one [`provider`](spi/FileSystemProvider.md "class in java.nio.file.spi") with a parameter that is an object created by another provider,
will throw [`ProviderMismatchException`](ProviderMismatchException.md "class in java.nio.file").

## Optional Specific Exceptions

Most of the methods defined by classes in this package that access the
file system specify that [`IOException`](../../io/IOException.md "class in java.io") be thrown when an I/O
error occurs. In some cases, these methods define specific I/O exceptions
for common cases. These exceptions, noted as *optional specific exceptions*,
are thrown by the implementation where it can detect the specific error.
Where the specific error cannot be detected then the more general `IOException` is thrown.
