# Class Charset

[java.lang.Object](../../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

java.nio.charset.Charset

All Implemented Interfaces:
:   `Comparable<Charset>`

---

public abstract class Charset
extends [Object](../../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Comparable](../../lang/Comparable.md "interface in java.lang")<[Charset](Charset.md "class in java.nio.charset")>

A named mapping between sequences of sixteen-bit Unicode [code units](../../lang/Character.md#unicode) and sequences of
bytes. This class defines methods for creating decoders and encoders and
for retrieving the various names associated with a charset. Instances of
this class are immutable.

This class also defines static methods for testing whether a particular
charset is supported, for locating charset instances by name, and for
constructing a map that contains every charset for which support is
available in the current Java virtual machine. Support for new charsets can
be added via the service-provider interface defined in the [`CharsetProvider`](spi/CharsetProvider.md "class in java.nio.charset.spi") class.

All of the methods defined in this class are safe for use by multiple
concurrent threads.

## Charset names

Charsets are named by strings composed of the following characters:

* The uppercase letters `'A'` through `'Z'`
  (`'\u0041'` through `'\u005a'`),* The lowercase letters `'a'` through `'z'`
    (`'\u0061'` through `'\u007a'`),* The digits `'0'` through `'9'`
      (`'\u0030'` through `'\u0039'`),* The dash character `'-'`
        (`'\u002d'`, HYPHEN-MINUS),* The plus character `'+'`
          (`'\u002b'`, PLUS SIGN),* The period character `'.'`
            (`'\u002e'`, FULL STOP),* The colon character `':'`
              (`'\u003a'`, COLON), and* The underscore character `'_'`
                (`'\u005f'`, LOW LINE).

A charset name must begin with either a letter or a digit. The empty string
is not a legal charset name. Charset names are not case-sensitive; that is,
case is always ignored when comparing charset names. Charset names
generally follow the conventions documented in [*RFC 2278: IANA Charset
Registration Procedures*](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2278.txt).

Every charset has a *canonical name* and may also have one or more
*aliases*. The canonical name is returned by the [`name`](#name()) method
of this class. Canonical names are, by convention, usually in upper case.
The aliases of a charset are returned by the [`aliases`](#aliases())
method.

Some charsets have an *historical name* that is defined for
compatibility with previous versions of the Java platform. A charset's
historical name is either its canonical name or one of its aliases. The
historical name is returned by the `getEncoding()` methods of the
[`InputStreamReader`](../../io/InputStreamReader.md#getEncoding()) and [`OutputStreamWriter`](../../io/OutputStreamWriter.md#getEncoding()) classes.

If a charset listed in the [*IANA Charset
Registry*](http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets) is supported by an implementation of the Java platform then
its canonical name must be the name listed in the registry. Many charsets
are given more than one name in the registry, in which case the registry
identifies one of the names as *MIME-preferred*. If a charset has more
than one registry name then its canonical name must be the MIME-preferred
name and the other names in the registry must be valid aliases. If a
supported charset is not listed in the IANA registry then its canonical name
must begin with one of the strings `"X-"` or `"x-"`.

The IANA charset registry does change over time, and so the canonical
name and the aliases of a particular charset may also change over time. To
ensure compatibility it is recommended that no alias ever be removed from a
charset, and that if the canonical name of a charset is changed then its
previous canonical name be made into an alias.

## Standard charsets

Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the
following standard charsets. Consult the release documentation for your
implementation to see if any other charsets are supported. The behavior
of such optional charsets may differ between implementations.
> Description of standard charsets
>
> | Charset | Description |
> | --- | --- |
> | `US-ASCII` | Seven-bit ASCII, a.k.a. `ISO646-US`, a.k.a. the Basic Latin block of the Unicode character set |
> | `ISO-8859-1` | ISO Latin Alphabet No. 1, a.k.a. `ISO-LATIN-1` |
> | `UTF-8` | Eight-bit UCS Transformation Format |
> | `UTF-16BE` | Sixteen-bit UCS Transformation Format, big-endian byte order |
> | `UTF-16LE` | Sixteen-bit UCS Transformation Format, little-endian byte order |
> | `UTF-16` | Sixteen-bit UCS Transformation Format, byte order identified by an optional byte-order mark |

The `UTF-8` charset is specified by [*RFC 2279*](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2279.txt); the
transformation format upon which it is based is specified in
Amendment 2 of ISO 10646-1 and is also described in the [*Unicode
Standard*](http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html).

The `UTF-16` charsets are specified by [*RFC 2781*](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2781.txt); the
transformation formats upon which they are based are specified in
Amendment 1 of ISO 10646-1 and are also described in the [*Unicode
Standard*](http://www.unicode.org/standard/standard.html).

The `UTF-16` charsets use sixteen-bit quantities and are
therefore sensitive to byte order. In these encodings the byte order of a
stream may be indicated by an initial *byte-order mark* represented by
the Unicode character `'\uFEFF'`. Byte-order marks are handled
as follows:

* When decoding, the `UTF-16BE` and `UTF-16LE`
  charsets interpret the initial byte-order marks as a ZERO-WIDTH
  NON-BREAKING SPACE; when encoding, they do not write
  byte-order marks.
* When decoding, the `UTF-16` charset interprets the
  byte-order mark at the beginning of the input stream to indicate the
  byte-order of the stream but defaults to big-endian if there is no
  byte-order mark; when encoding, it uses big-endian byte order and writes
  a big-endian byte-order mark.

In any case, byte order marks occurring after the first element of an
input sequence are not omitted since the same code is used to represent
ZERO-WIDTH NON-BREAKING SPACE.

Every instance of the Java virtual machine has a default charset, which
is `UTF-8` unless changed in an implementation specific manner. Refer to
[`defaultCharset()`](#defaultCharset()) for more detail.

The [`StandardCharsets`](StandardCharsets.md "class in java.nio.charset") class defines constants for each of the
standard charsets.

## Terminology

The name of this class is taken from the terms used in
[*RFC 2278*](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2278.txt).
In that document a *charset* is defined as the combination of
one or more coded character sets and a character-encoding scheme.
(This definition is confusing; some other software systems define
*charset* as a synonym for *coded character set*.)

A *coded character set* is a mapping between a set of abstract
characters and a set of integers. US-ASCII, ISO 8859-1,
JIS X 0201, and Unicode are examples of coded character sets.

Some standards have defined a *character set* to be simply a
set of abstract characters without an associated assigned numbering.
An alphabet is an example of such a character set. However, the subtle
distinction between *character set* and *coded character set*
is rarely used in practice; the former has become a short form for the
latter, including in the Java API specification.

A *character-encoding scheme* is a mapping between one or more
coded character sets and a set of octet (eight-bit byte) sequences.
UTF-8, UTF-16, ISO 2022, and EUC are examples of
character-encoding schemes. Encoding schemes are often associated with
a particular coded character set; UTF-8, for example, is used only to
encode Unicode. Some schemes, however, are associated with multiple
coded character sets; EUC, for example, can be used to encode
characters in a variety of Asian coded character sets.

When a coded character set is used exclusively with a single
character-encoding scheme then the corresponding charset is usually
named for the coded character set; otherwise a charset is usually named
for the encoding scheme and, possibly, the locale of the coded
character sets that it supports. Hence `US-ASCII` is both the
name of a coded character set and of the charset that encodes it, while
`EUC-JP` is the name of the charset that encodes the
JIS X 0201, JIS X 0208, and JIS X 0212
coded character sets for the Japanese language.

The native character encoding of the Java programming language is
UTF-16. A charset in the Java platform therefore defines a mapping
between sequences of sixteen-bit UTF-16 code units (that is, sequences
of chars) and sequences of bytes.

  + ### availableCharsets

    public static [SortedMap](../../util/SortedMap.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang"),[Charset](Charset.md "class in java.nio.charset")> availableCharsets()

    Constructs a sorted map from canonical charset names to charset objects.

    The map returned by this method will have one entry for each charset
    for which support is available in the current Java virtual machine. If
    two or more supported charsets have the same canonical name then the
    resulting map will contain just one of them; which one it will contain
    is not specified.

    The invocation of this method, and the subsequent use of the
    resulting map, may cause time-consuming disk or network I/O operations
    to occur. This method is provided for applications that need to
    enumerate all of the available charsets, for example to allow user
    charset selection. This method is not used by the [`forName`](#forName(java.lang.String)) method, which instead employs an efficient incremental lookup
    algorithm.

    This method may return different results at different times if new
    charset providers are dynamically made available to the current Java
    virtual machine. In the absence of such changes, the charsets returned
    by this method are exactly those that can be retrieved via the [`forName`](#forName(java.lang.String)) method.

    Returns:
    :   An immutable, case-insensitive map from canonical charset names
        to charset objects
  + ### defaultCharset

    public static [Charset](Charset.md "class in java.nio.charset") defaultCharset()

    Returns the default charset of this Java virtual machine.

    The default charset is `UTF-8`, unless changed in an
    implementation specific manner.

    Returns:
    :   A charset object for the default charset

  + ### name

    public final [String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name()

    Returns this charset's canonical name.

    Returns:
    :   The canonical name of this charset
  + ### aliases

    public final [Set](../../util/Set.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> aliases()

    Returns a set containing this charset's aliases.

    Returns:
    :   An immutable set of this charset's aliases
  + ### displayName

    public [String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") displayName()

    Returns this charset's human-readable name for the default locale.

    The default implementation of this method simply returns this
    charset's canonical name. Concrete subclasses of this class may
    override this method in order to provide a localized display name.

    Returns:
    :   The display name of this charset in the default locale
  + ### isRegistered

    public final boolean isRegistered()

    Tells whether or not this charset is registered in the [IANA Charset
    Registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets).

    Returns:
    :   `true` if, and only if, this charset is known by its
        implementor to be registered with the IANA

  + ### displayName

    public [String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") displayName([Locale](../../util/Locale.md "class in java.util") locale)

    Returns this charset's human-readable name for the given locale.

    The default implementation of this method simply returns this
    charset's canonical name. Concrete subclasses of this class may
    override this method in order to provide a localized display name.

    Parameters:
    :   `locale` - The locale for which the display name is to be retrieved

    Returns:
    :   The display name of this charset in the given locale
  + ### contains

    public abstract boolean contains([Charset](Charset.md "class in java.nio.charset") cs)

    Tells whether or not this charset contains the given charset.

    A charset *C* is said to *contain* a charset *D* if,
    and only if, every character representable in *D* is also
    representable in *C*. If this relationship holds then it is
    guaranteed that every string that can be encoded in *D* can also be
    encoded in *C* without performing any replacements.

    That *C* contains *D* does not imply that each character
    representable in *C* by a particular byte sequence is represented
    in *D* by the same byte sequence, although sometimes this is the
    case.

    Every charset contains itself.

    This method computes an approximation of the containment relation:
    If it returns `true` then the given charset is known to be
    contained by this charset; if it returns `false`, however, then
    it is not necessarily the case that the given charset is not contained
    in this charset.

    Parameters:
    :   `cs` - The given charset

    Returns:
    :   `true` if the given charset is contained in this charset
  + ### newDecoder

    public abstract [CharsetDecoder](CharsetDecoder.md "class in java.nio.charset") newDecoder()

    Constructs a new decoder for this charset.

    Returns:
    :   A new decoder for this charset
  + ### newEncoder

    public abstract [CharsetEncoder](CharsetEncoder.md "class in java.nio.charset") newEncoder()

    Constructs a new encoder for this charset.

    Returns:
    :   A new encoder for this charset

    Throws:
    :   `UnsupportedOperationException` - If this charset does not support encoding
  + ### canEncode

    public boolean canEncode()

    Tells whether or not this charset supports encoding.

    Nearly all charsets support encoding. The primary exceptions are
    special-purpose *auto-detect* charsets whose decoders can determine
    which of several possible encoding schemes is in use by examining the
    input byte sequence. Such charsets do not support encoding because
    there is no way to determine which encoding should be used on output.
    Implementations of such charsets should override this method to return
    `false`.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if, and only if, this charset supports encoding
  + ### decode

    public final [CharBuffer](../CharBuffer.md "class in java.nio") decode([ByteBuffer](../ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") bb)

    Convenience method that decodes bytes in this charset into Unicode
    characters.

    An invocation of this method upon a charset `cs` returns the
    same result as the expression

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        cs.newDecoder()
          .onMalformedInput(CodingErrorAction.REPLACE)
          .onUnmappableCharacter(CodingErrorAction.REPLACE)
          .decode(bb);
    ```

    except that it is potentially more efficient because it can cache
    decoders between successive invocations.

    This method always replaces malformed-input and unmappable-character
    sequences with this charset's default replacement byte array. In order
    to detect such sequences, use the [`CharsetDecoder.decode(java.nio.ByteBuffer)`](CharsetDecoder.md#decode(java.nio.ByteBuffer)) method directly.

    Parameters:
    :   `bb` - The byte buffer to be decoded

    Returns:
    :   A char buffer containing the decoded characters
  + ### encode

    public final [ByteBuffer](../ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") encode([CharBuffer](../CharBuffer.md "class in java.nio") cb)

    Convenience method that encodes Unicode characters into bytes in this
    charset.

    An invocation of this method upon a charset `cs` returns the
    same result as the expression

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        cs.newEncoder()
          .onMalformedInput(CodingErrorAction.REPLACE)
          .onUnmappableCharacter(CodingErrorAction.REPLACE)
          .encode(bb);
    ```

    except that it is potentially more efficient because it can cache
    encoders between successive invocations.

    This method always replaces malformed-input and unmappable-character
    sequences with this charset's default replacement string. In order to
    detect such sequences, use the [`CharsetEncoder.encode(java.nio.CharBuffer)`](CharsetEncoder.md#encode(java.nio.CharBuffer)) method directly.

    Parameters:
    :   `cb` - The char buffer to be encoded

    Returns:
    :   A byte buffer containing the encoded characters
  + ### encode

    public final [ByteBuffer](../ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") encode([String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") str)

    Convenience method that encodes a string into bytes in this charset.

    An invocation of this method upon a charset `cs` returns the
    same result as the expression

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        cs.encode(CharBuffer.wrap(s));
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `str` - The string to be encoded

    Returns:
    :   A byte buffer containing the encoded characters
  + ### compareTo

    public final int compareTo([Charset](Charset.md "class in java.nio.charset") that)

    Compares this charset to another.

    Charsets are ordered by their canonical names, without regard to
    case.

    Specified by:
    :   `compareTo` in interface `Comparable<Charset>`

    Parameters:
    :   `that` - The charset to which this charset is to be compared

    Returns:
    :   A negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this charset
        is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified charset
  + ### hashCode

    public final int hashCode()

    Computes a hashcode for this charset.

    Overrides:
    :   `hashCode` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   An integer hashcode

    See Also:
    :   - [`Object.equals(java.lang.Object)`](../../lang/Object.md#equals(java.lang.Object))
        - [`System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)`](../../lang/System.md#identityHashCode(java.lang.Object))
  + ### equals

    public final boolean equals([Object](../../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") ob)

    Tells whether or not this object is equal to another.

    Two charsets are equal if, and only if, they have the same canonical
    names. A charset is never equal to any other type of object.

    Overrides:
    :   `equals` in class `Object`

    Parameters:
    :   `ob` - the reference object with which to compare.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if, and only if, this charset is equal to the
        given object
