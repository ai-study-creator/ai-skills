public abstract sealed class MappedByteBuffer
extends [ByteBuffer](ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio")

A direct byte buffer whose content is a memory-mapped region of a file.

Mapped byte buffers are created via the [`FileChannel.map`](channels/FileChannel.md#map(java.nio.channels.FileChannel.MapMode,long,long)) method. This class
extends the [`ByteBuffer`](ByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") class with operations that are specific to
memory-mapped file regions.

A mapped byte buffer and the file mapping that it represents remain
valid until the buffer itself is garbage-collected.

The content of a mapped byte buffer can change at any time, for example
if the content of the corresponding region of the mapped file is changed by
this program or another. Whether or not such changes occur, and when they
occur, is operating-system dependent and therefore unspecified.

All or part of a mapped byte buffer may become
inaccessible at any time, for example if the mapped file is truncated. An
attempt to access an inaccessible region of a mapped byte buffer will not
change the buffer's content and will cause an unspecified exception to be
thrown either at the time of the access or at some later time. It is
therefore strongly recommended that appropriate precautions be taken to
avoid the manipulation of a mapped file by this program, or by a
concurrently running program, except to read or write the file's content.

Mapped byte buffers otherwise behave no differently than ordinary direct
byte buffers.

* ## Method Details

  + ### isLoaded

    public final boolean isLoaded()

    Tells whether or not this buffer's content is resident in physical
    memory.

    A return value of `true` implies that it is highly likely
    that all of the data in this buffer is resident in physical memory and
    may therefore be accessed without incurring any virtual-memory page
    faults or I/O operations. A return value of `false` does not
    necessarily imply that the buffer's content is not resident in physical
    memory.

    The returned value is a hint, rather than a guarantee, because the
    underlying operating system may have paged out some of the buffer's data
    by the time that an invocation of this method returns.

    Returns:
    :   `true` if it is likely that this buffer's content
        is resident in physical memory
  + ### load

    public final [MappedByteBuffer](MappedByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") load()

    Loads this buffer's content into physical memory.

    This method makes a best effort to ensure that, when it returns,
    this buffer's content is resident in physical memory. Invoking this
    method may cause some number of page faults and I/O operations to
    occur.

    Returns:
    :   This buffer
  + ### force

    public final [MappedByteBuffer](MappedByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") force()

    Forces any changes made to this buffer's content to be written to the
    storage device containing the mapped file. The region starts at index
    zero in this buffer and is `capacity()` bytes. An invocation of
    this method behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation
    [`force(0,capacity())`](#force(int,int)).

    If the file mapped into this buffer resides on a local storage
    device then when this method returns it is guaranteed that all changes
    made to the buffer since it was created, or since this method was last
    invoked, will have been written to that device.

    If the file does not reside on a local device then no such guarantee
    is made.

    If this buffer was not mapped in read/write mode ([`FileChannel.MapMode.READ_WRITE`](channels/FileChannel.MapMode.md#READ_WRITE)) then
    invoking this method may have no effect. In particular, the
    method has no effect for buffers mapped in read-only or private
    mapping modes. This method may or may not have an effect for
    implementation-specific mapping modes.

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Throws:
    :   `UncheckedIOException` - If an I/O error occurs writing the buffer's content to the
        storage device containing the mapped file
  + ### force

    public final [MappedByteBuffer](MappedByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") force(int index,
    int length)

    Forces any changes made to a region of this buffer's content to
    be written to the storage device containing the mapped
    file. The region starts at the given `index` in this
    buffer and is `length` bytes.

    If the file mapped into this buffer resides on a local
    storage device then when this method returns it is guaranteed
    that all changes made to the selected region buffer since it
    was created, or since this method was last invoked, will have
    been written to that device. The force operation is free to
    write bytes that lie outside the specified region, for example
    to ensure that data blocks of some device-specific granularity
    are transferred in their entirety.

    If the file does not reside on a local device then no such
    guarantee is made.

    If this buffer was not mapped in read/write mode ([`FileChannel.MapMode.READ_WRITE`](channels/FileChannel.MapMode.md#READ_WRITE)) then
    invoking this method may have no effect. In particular, the
    method has no effect for buffers mapped in read-only or private
    mapping modes. This method may or may not have an effect for
    implementation-specific mapping modes.

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - The index of the first byte in the buffer region that is
        to be written back to storage; must be non-negative
        and less than `capacity()`
    :   `length` - The length of the region in bytes; must be non-negative
        and no larger than `capacity() - index`

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Throws:
    :   `IndexOutOfBoundsException` - if the preconditions on the index and length do not
        hold.
    :   `UncheckedIOException` - If an I/O error occurs writing the buffer's content to the
        storage device containing the mapped file

  + ### position

    public final [MappedByteBuffer](MappedByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") position(int newPosition)

    Sets this buffer's position. If the mark is defined and larger than the
    new position then it is discarded.

    Overrides:
    :   `position` in class `ByteBuffer`

    Parameters:
    :   `newPosition` - The new position value; must be non-negative
        and no larger than the current limit

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### limit

    public final [MappedByteBuffer](MappedByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") limit(int newLimit)

    Sets this buffer's limit. If the position is larger than the new limit
    then it is set to the new limit. If the mark is defined and larger than
    the new limit then it is discarded.

    Overrides:
    :   `limit` in class `ByteBuffer`

    Parameters:
    :   `newLimit` - The new limit value; must be non-negative
        and no larger than this buffer's capacity

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### mark

    public final [MappedByteBuffer](MappedByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") mark()

    Sets this buffer's mark at its position.

    Overrides:
    :   `mark` in class `ByteBuffer`

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### reset

    public final [MappedByteBuffer](MappedByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") reset()

    Resets this buffer's position to the previously-marked position.

    Invoking this method neither changes nor discards the mark's
    value.

    Overrides:
    :   `reset` in class `ByteBuffer`

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### clear

    public final [MappedByteBuffer](MappedByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") clear()

    Clears this buffer. The position is set to zero, the limit is set to
    the capacity, and the mark is discarded.

    Invoke this method before using a sequence of channel-read or
    *put* operations to fill this buffer. For example:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        buf.clear();     // Prepare buffer for reading
        in.read(buf);    // Read data
    ```

    This method does not actually erase the data in the buffer, but it
    is named as if it did because it will most often be used in situations
    in which that might as well be the case.

    Overrides:
    :   `clear` in class `ByteBuffer`

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### flip

    public final [MappedByteBuffer](MappedByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") flip()

    Flips this buffer. The limit is set to the current position and then
    the position is set to zero. If the mark is defined then it is
    discarded.

    After a sequence of channel-read or *put* operations, invoke
    this method to prepare for a sequence of channel-write or relative
    *get* operations. For example:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        buf.put(magic);    // Prepend header
        in.read(buf);      // Read data into rest of buffer
        buf.flip();        // Flip buffer
        out.write(buf);    // Write header + data to channel
    ```

    This method is often used in conjunction with the [`compact`](ByteBuffer.md#compact()) method when transferring data from
    one place to another.

    Overrides:
    :   `flip` in class `ByteBuffer`

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### rewind

    public final [MappedByteBuffer](MappedByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") rewind()

    Rewinds this buffer. The position is set to zero and the mark is
    discarded.

    Invoke this method before a sequence of channel-write or *get*
    operations, assuming that the limit has already been set
    appropriately. For example:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        out.write(buf);    // Write remaining data
        buf.rewind();      // Rewind buffer
        buf.get(array);    // Copy data into array
    ```

    Overrides:
    :   `rewind` in class `ByteBuffer`

    Returns:
    :   This buffer

    Since:
    :   9
  + ### slice

    public abstract [MappedByteBuffer](MappedByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") slice()

    Creates a new byte buffer whose content is a shared subsequence of
    this buffer's content.

    The content of the new buffer will start at this buffer's current
    position. Changes to this buffer's content will be visible in the new
    buffer, and vice versa; the two buffers' position, limit, and mark
    values will be independent.

    The new buffer's position will be zero, its capacity and its limit
    will be the number of bytes remaining in this buffer, its mark will be
    undefined, and its byte order will be
    [`BIG_ENDIAN`](ByteOrder.md#BIG_ENDIAN).
    The new buffer will be direct if, and only if, this buffer is direct, and
    it will be read-only if, and only if, this buffer is read-only.

    Reading bytes into physical memory by invoking `load()` on the
    returned buffer, or writing bytes to the storage device by invoking
    `force()` on the returned buffer, will only act on the sub-range
    of this buffer that the returned buffer represents, namely
    `[position(),limit())`.

    Specified by:
    :   `slice` in class `ByteBuffer`

    Returns:
    :   The new byte buffer

    See Also:
    :   - [`ByteBuffer.alignedSlice(int)`](ByteBuffer.md#alignedSlice(int))
  + ### slice

    public abstract [MappedByteBuffer](MappedByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") slice(int index,
    int length)

    Creates a new byte buffer whose content is a shared subsequence of
    this buffer's content.

    The content of the new buffer will start at position `index`
    in this buffer, and will contain `length` elements. Changes to
    this buffer's content will be visible in the new buffer, and vice versa;
    the two buffers' position, limit, and mark values will be independent.

    The new buffer's position will be zero, its capacity and its limit
    will be `length`, its mark will be undefined, and its byte order
    will be
    [`BIG_ENDIAN`](ByteOrder.md#BIG_ENDIAN).
    The new buffer will be direct if, and only if, this buffer is direct,
    and it will be read-only if, and only if, this buffer is read-only.

    Reading bytes into physical memory by invoking `load()` on the
    returned buffer, or writing bytes to the storage device by invoking
    `force()` on the returned buffer, will only act on the sub-range
    of this buffer that the returned buffer represents, namely
    `[index,index+length)`, where `index` and `length` are
    assumed to satisfy the preconditions.

    Specified by:
    :   `slice` in class `ByteBuffer`

    Parameters:
    :   `index` - The position in this buffer at which the content of the new
        buffer will start; must be non-negative and no larger than
        [`limit()`](Buffer.md#limit())
    :   `length` - The number of elements the new buffer will contain; must be
        non-negative and no larger than `limit() - index`

    Returns:
    :   The new buffer
  + ### duplicate

    public abstract [MappedByteBuffer](MappedByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") duplicate()

    Creates a new byte buffer that shares this buffer's content.

    The content of the new buffer will be that of this buffer. Changes
    to this buffer's content will be visible in the new buffer, and vice
    versa; the two buffers' position, limit, and mark values will be
    independent.

    The new buffer's capacity, limit, position,
    and mark values will be identical to those of this buffer, and its byte
    order will be [`BIG_ENDIAN`](ByteOrder.md#BIG_ENDIAN).
    The new buffer will be direct if, and only if, this buffer is direct, and
    it will be read-only if, and only if, this buffer is read-only.

    Specified by:
    :   `duplicate` in class `ByteBuffer`

    Returns:
    :   The new byte buffer
  + ### compact

    public abstract [MappedByteBuffer](MappedByteBuffer.md "class in java.nio") compact()

    Compacts this buffer  *(optional operation)*.

    The bytes between the buffer's current position and its limit,
    if any, are copied to the beginning of the buffer. That is, the
    byte at index *p* = `position()` is copied
    to index zero, the byte at index *p* + 1 is copied
    to index one, and so forth until the byte at index
    `limit()` - 1 is copied to index
    *n* = `limit()` - `1` - *p*.
    The buffer's position is then set to *n+1* and its limit is set to
    its capacity. The mark, if defined, is discarded.

    The buffer's position is set to the number of bytes copied,
    rather than to zero, so that an invocation of this method can be
    followed immediately by an invocation of another relative *put*
    method.

    Invoke this method after writing data from a buffer in case the
    write was incomplete. The following loop, for example, copies bytes
    from one channel to another via the buffer `buf`:

    Copy![Copy snippet](../../../copy.svg)

    ```
        buf.clear();          // Prepare buffer for use
        while (in.read(buf) >= 0 || buf.position != 0) {
            buf.flip();
            out.write(buf);
            buf.compact();    // In case of partial write
        }
    ```

    Specified by:
    :   `compact` in class `ByteBuffer`

    Returns:
    :   This buffer
