java.time.zone.ZoneRulesProvider

---

public abstract class ZoneRulesProvider
extends [Object](../../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

Provider of time-zone rules to the system.

This class manages the configuration of time-zone rules.
The static methods provide the public API that can be used to manage the providers.
The abstract methods provide the SPI that allows rules to be provided.

ZoneRulesProvider may be installed in an instance of the Java Platform as
extension classes, that is, jar files placed into any of the usual extension
directories. Installed providers are loaded using the service-provider loading
facility defined by the [`ServiceLoader`](../../util/ServiceLoader.md "class in java.util") class. A ZoneRulesProvider
identifies itself with a provider configuration file named
`java.time.zone.ZoneRulesProvider` in the resource directory
`META-INF/services`. The file should contain a line that specifies the
fully qualified concrete zonerules-provider class name.
Providers may also be made available by adding them to the class path or by
registering themselves via [`registerProvider(java.time.zone.ZoneRulesProvider)`](#registerProvider(java.time.zone.ZoneRulesProvider)) method.

The Java virtual machine has a default provider that provides zone rules
for the time-zones defined by IANA Time Zone Database (TZDB). If the system
property `java.time.zone.DefaultZoneRulesProvider` is defined then
it is taken to be the fully-qualified name of a concrete ZoneRulesProvider
class to be loaded as the default provider, using the system class loader.
If this system property is not defined, a system-default provider will be
loaded to serve as the default provider.

Rules are looked up primarily by zone ID, as used by [`ZoneId`](../ZoneId.md "class in java.time").
Only zone region IDs may be used, zone offset IDs are not used here.

Time-zone rules are political, thus the data can change at any time.
Each provider will provide the latest rules for each zone ID, but they
may also provide the history of how the rules changed.

  + ### getAvailableZoneIds

    public static [Set](../../util/Set.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> getAvailableZoneIds()

    Gets the set of available zone IDs.

    These IDs are the string form of a [`ZoneId`](../ZoneId.md "class in java.time").

    Returns:
    :   the unmodifiable set of zone IDs, not null
  + ### getRules

    public static [ZoneRules](ZoneRules.md "class in java.time.zone") getRules([String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") zoneId,
    boolean forCaching)

    Gets the rules for the zone ID.

    This returns the latest available rules for the zone ID.

    This method relies on time-zone data provider files that are configured.
    These are loaded using a `ServiceLoader`.

    The caching flag is designed to allow provider implementations to
    prevent the rules being cached in `ZoneId`.
    Under normal circumstances, the caching of zone rules is highly desirable
    as it will provide greater performance. However, there is a use case where
    the caching would not be desirable, see [`provideRules(java.lang.String, boolean)`](#provideRules(java.lang.String,boolean)).

    Parameters:
    :   `zoneId` - the zone ID as defined by `ZoneId`, not null
    :   `forCaching` - whether the rules are being queried for caching,
        true if the returned rules will be cached by `ZoneId`,
        false if they will be returned to the user without being cached in `ZoneId`

    Returns:
    :   the rules, null if `forCaching` is true and this
        is a dynamic provider that wants to prevent caching in `ZoneId`,
        otherwise not null

    Throws:
    :   `ZoneRulesException` - if rules cannot be obtained for the zone ID
  + ### getVersions

    public static [NavigableMap](../../util/NavigableMap.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang"),[ZoneRules](ZoneRules.md "class in java.time.zone")> getVersions([String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") zoneId)

    Gets the history of rules for the zone ID.

    Time-zones are defined by governments and change frequently.
    This method allows applications to find the history of changes to the
    rules for a single zone ID. The map is keyed by a string, which is the
    version string associated with the rules.

    The exact meaning and format of the version is provider specific.
    The version must follow lexicographical order, thus the returned map will
    be order from the oldest known rules to the newest available rules.
    The default 'TZDB' group uses version numbering consisting of the year
    followed by a letter, such as '2009e' or '2012f'.

    Implementations must provide a result for each valid zone ID, however
    they do not have to provide a history of rules.
    Thus the map will always contain one element, and will only contain more
    than one element if historical rule information is available.

    Parameters:
    :   `zoneId` - the zone ID as defined by `ZoneId`, not null

    Returns:
    :   a modifiable copy of the history of the rules for the ID, sorted
        from oldest to newest, not null

    Throws:
    :   `ZoneRulesException` - if history cannot be obtained for the zone ID
  + ### registerProvider

    public static void registerProvider([ZoneRulesProvider](ZoneRulesProvider.md "class in java.time.zone") provider)

    Registers a zone rules provider.

    This adds a new provider to those currently available.
    A provider supplies rules for one or more zone IDs.
    A provider cannot be registered if it supplies a zone ID that has already been
    registered. See the notes on time-zone IDs in [`ZoneId`](../ZoneId.md "class in java.time"), especially
    the section on using the concept of a "group" to make IDs unique.

    To ensure the integrity of time-zones already created, there is no way
    to deregister providers.

    Parameters:
    :   `provider` - the provider to register, not null

    Throws:
    :   `ZoneRulesException` - if a zone ID is already registered
  + ### refresh

    public static boolean refresh()

    Refreshes the rules from the underlying data provider.

    This method allows an application to request that the providers check
    for any updates to the provided rules.
    After calling this method, the offset stored in any [`ZonedDateTime`](../ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time")
    may be invalid for the zone ID.

    Dynamic update of rules is a complex problem and most applications
    should not use this method or dynamic rules.
    To achieve dynamic rules, a provider implementation will have to be written
    as per the specification of this class.
    In addition, instances of `ZoneRules` must not be cached in the
    application as they will become stale. However, the boolean flag on
    [`provideRules(String, boolean)`](#provideRules(java.lang.String,boolean)) allows provider implementations
    to control the caching of `ZoneId`, potentially ensuring that
    all objects in the system see the new rules.
    Note that there is likely to be a cost in performance of a dynamic rules
    provider. Note also that no dynamic rules provider is in this specification.

    Returns:
    :   true if the rules were updated

    Throws:
    :   `ZoneRulesException` - if an error occurs during the refresh
  + ### provideZoneIds

    protected abstract [Set](../../util/Set.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> provideZoneIds()

    SPI method to get the available zone IDs.

    This obtains the IDs that this `ZoneRulesProvider` provides.
    A provider should provide data for at least one zone ID.

    The returned zone IDs remain available and valid for the lifetime of the application.
    A dynamic provider may increase the set of IDs as more data becomes available.

    Returns:
    :   the set of zone IDs being provided, not null

    Throws:
    :   `ZoneRulesException` - if a problem occurs while providing the IDs
  + ### provideRules

    protected abstract [ZoneRules](ZoneRules.md "class in java.time.zone") provideRules([String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") zoneId,
    boolean forCaching)

    SPI method to get the rules for the zone ID.

    This loads the rules for the specified zone ID.
    The provider implementation must validate that the zone ID is valid and
    available, throwing a `ZoneRulesException` if it is not.
    The result of the method in the valid case depends on the caching flag.

    If the provider implementation is not dynamic, then the result of the
    method must be the non-null set of rules selected by the ID.

    If the provider implementation is dynamic, then the flag gives the option
    of preventing the returned rules from being cached in [`ZoneId`](../ZoneId.md "class in java.time").
    When the flag is true, the provider is permitted to return null, where
    null will prevent the rules from being cached in `ZoneId`.
    When the flag is false, the provider must return non-null rules.

    Parameters:
    :   `zoneId` - the zone ID as defined by `ZoneId`, not null
    :   `forCaching` - whether the rules are being queried for caching,
        true if the returned rules will be cached by `ZoneId`,
        false if they will be returned to the user without being cached in `ZoneId`

    Returns:
    :   the rules, null if `forCaching` is true and this
        is a dynamic provider that wants to prevent caching in `ZoneId`,
        otherwise not null

    Throws:
    :   `ZoneRulesException` - if rules cannot be obtained for the zone ID
  + ### provideVersions

    protected abstract [NavigableMap](../../util/NavigableMap.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang"),[ZoneRules](ZoneRules.md "class in java.time.zone")> provideVersions([String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") zoneId)

    SPI method to get the history of rules for the zone ID.

    This returns a map of historical rules keyed by a version string.
    The exact meaning and format of the version is provider specific.
    The version must follow lexicographical order, thus the returned map will
    be order from the oldest known rules to the newest available rules.
    The default 'TZDB' group uses version numbering consisting of the year
    followed by a letter, such as '2009e' or '2012f'.

    Implementations must provide a result for each valid zone ID, however
    they do not have to provide a history of rules.
    Thus the map will contain at least one element, and will only contain
    more than one element if historical rule information is available.

    The returned versions remain available and valid for the lifetime of the application.
    A dynamic provider may increase the set of versions as more data becomes available.

    Parameters:
    :   `zoneId` - the zone ID as defined by `ZoneId`, not null

    Returns:
    :   a modifiable copy of the history of the rules for the ID, sorted
        from oldest to newest, not null

    Throws:
    :   `ZoneRulesException` - if history cannot be obtained for the zone ID
  + ### provideRefresh

    protected boolean provideRefresh()

    SPI method to refresh the rules from the underlying data provider.

    This method provides the opportunity for a provider to dynamically
    recheck the underlying data provider to find the latest rules.
    This could be used to load new rules without stopping the JVM.
    Dynamic behavior is entirely optional and most providers do not support it.

    This implementation returns false.

    Returns:
    :   true if the rules were updated

    Throws:
    :   `ZoneRulesException` - if an error occurs during the refresh
