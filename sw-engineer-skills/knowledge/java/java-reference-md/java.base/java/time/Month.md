public enum Month
extends [Enum](../lang/Enum.md "class in java.lang")<[Month](Month.md "enum class in java.time")>
implements [TemporalAccessor](temporal/TemporalAccessor.md "interface in java.time.temporal"), [TemporalAdjuster](temporal/TemporalAdjuster.md "interface in java.time.temporal")

A month-of-year, such as 'July'.

`Month` is an enum representing the 12 months of the year -
January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October,
November and December.

In addition to the textual enum name, each month-of-year has an `int` value.
The `int` value follows normal usage and the ISO-8601 standard,
from 1 (January) to 12 (December). It is recommended that applications use the enum
rather than the `int` value to ensure code clarity.

**Do not use `ordinal()` to obtain the numeric representation of `Month`.
Use `getValue()` instead.**

This enum represents a common concept that is found in many calendar systems.
As such, this enum may be used by any calendar system that has the month-of-year
concept defined exactly equivalent to the ISO-8601 calendar system.

  + ### values

    public static [Month](Month.md "enum class in java.time")[] values()

    Returns an array containing the constants of this enum class, in
    the order they are declared.

    Returns:
    :   an array containing the constants of this enum class, in the order they are declared
  + ### valueOf

    public static [Month](Month.md "enum class in java.time") valueOf([String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name)

    Returns the enum constant of this class with the specified name.
    The string must match *exactly* an identifier used to declare an
    enum constant in this class. (Extraneous whitespace characters are
    not permitted.)

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - the name of the enum constant to be returned.

    Returns:
    :   the enum constant with the specified name

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if this enum class has no constant with the specified name
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the argument is null
  + ### of

    public static [Month](Month.md "enum class in java.time") of(int month)

    Obtains an instance of `Month` from an `int` value.

    `Month` is an enum representing the 12 months of the year.
    This factory allows the enum to be obtained from the `int` value.
    The `int` value follows the ISO-8601 standard, from 1 (January) to 12 (December).

    Parameters:
    :   `month` - the month-of-year to represent, from 1 (January) to 12 (December)

    Returns:
    :   the month-of-year, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the month-of-year is invalid
  + ### from

    public static [Month](Month.md "enum class in java.time") from([TemporalAccessor](temporal/TemporalAccessor.md "interface in java.time.temporal") temporal)

    Obtains an instance of `Month` from a temporal object.

    This obtains a month based on the specified temporal.
    A `TemporalAccessor` represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
    which this factory converts to an instance of `Month`.

    The conversion extracts the [`MONTH_OF_YEAR`](temporal/ChronoField.md#MONTH_OF_YEAR) field.
    The extraction is only permitted if the temporal object has an ISO
    chronology, or can be converted to a `LocalDate`.

    This method matches the signature of the functional interface [`TemporalQuery`](temporal/TemporalQuery.md "interface in java.time.temporal")
    allowing it to be used as a query via method reference, `Month::from`.

    Parameters:
    :   `temporal` - the temporal object to convert, not null

    Returns:
    :   the month-of-year, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if unable to convert to a `Month`
  + ### getValue

    public int getValue()

    Gets the month-of-year `int` value.

    The values are numbered following the ISO-8601 standard,
    from 1 (January) to 12 (December).

    Returns:
    :   the month-of-year, from 1 (January) to 12 (December)
  + ### getDisplayName

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getDisplayName([TextStyle](format/TextStyle.md "enum class in java.time.format") style,
    [Locale](../util/Locale.md "class in java.util") locale)

    Gets the textual representation, such as 'Jan' or 'December'.

    This returns the textual name used to identify the month-of-year,
    suitable for presentation to the user.
    The parameters control the style of the returned text and the locale.

    If no textual mapping is found then the [`numeric value`](#getValue()) is returned.

    Parameters:
    :   `style` - the length of the text required, not null
    :   `locale` - the locale to use, not null

    Returns:
    :   the text value of the month-of-year, not null
  + ### isSupported

    public boolean isSupported([TemporalField](temporal/TemporalField.md "interface in java.time.temporal") field)

    Checks if the specified field is supported.

    This checks if this month-of-year can be queried for the specified field.
    If false, then calling the [`range`](#range(java.time.temporal.TemporalField)) and
    [`get`](#get(java.time.temporal.TemporalField)) methods will throw an exception.

    If the field is [`MONTH_OF_YEAR`](temporal/ChronoField.md#MONTH_OF_YEAR) then
    this method returns true.
    All other `ChronoField` instances will return false.

    If the field is not a `ChronoField`, then the result of this method
    is obtained by invoking `TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)`
    passing `this` as the argument.
    Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.

    Specified by:
    :   `isSupported` in interface `TemporalAccessor`

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the field to check, null returns false

    Returns:
    :   true if the field is supported on this month-of-year, false if not
  + ### range

    public [ValueRange](temporal/ValueRange.md "class in java.time.temporal") range([TemporalField](temporal/TemporalField.md "interface in java.time.temporal") field)

    Gets the range of valid values for the specified field.

    The range object expresses the minimum and maximum valid values for a field.
    This month is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
    If it is not possible to return the range, because the field is not supported
    or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

    If the field is [`MONTH_OF_YEAR`](temporal/ChronoField.md#MONTH_OF_YEAR) then the
    range of the month-of-year, from 1 to 12, will be returned.
    All other `ChronoField` instances will throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.

    If the field is not a `ChronoField`, then the result of this method
    is obtained by invoking `TemporalField.rangeRefinedBy(TemporalAccessor)`
    passing `this` as the argument.
    Whether the range can be obtained is determined by the field.

    Specified by:
    :   `range` in interface `TemporalAccessor`

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the field to query the range for, not null

    Returns:
    :   the range of valid values for the field, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the range for the field cannot be obtained
    :   `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` - if the field is not supported
  + ### get

    public int get([TemporalField](temporal/TemporalField.md "interface in java.time.temporal") field)

    Gets the value of the specified field from this month-of-year as an `int`.

    This queries this month for the value of the specified field.
    The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field.
    If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
    or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

    If the field is [`MONTH_OF_YEAR`](temporal/ChronoField.md#MONTH_OF_YEAR) then the
    value of the month-of-year, from 1 to 12, will be returned.
    All other `ChronoField` instances will throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.

    If the field is not a `ChronoField`, then the result of this method
    is obtained by invoking `TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)`
    passing `this` as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
    and what the value represents, is determined by the field.

    Specified by:
    :   `get` in interface `TemporalAccessor`

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the field to get, not null

    Returns:
    :   the value for the field, within the valid range of values

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if a value for the field cannot be obtained or
        the value is outside the range of valid values for the field
    :   `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` - if the field is not supported or
        the range of values exceeds an `int`
    :   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs
  + ### getLong

    public long getLong([TemporalField](temporal/TemporalField.md "interface in java.time.temporal") field)

    Gets the value of the specified field from this month-of-year as a `long`.

    This queries this month for the value of the specified field.
    If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
    or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

    If the field is [`MONTH_OF_YEAR`](temporal/ChronoField.md#MONTH_OF_YEAR) then the
    value of the month-of-year, from 1 to 12, will be returned.
    All other `ChronoField` instances will throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.

    If the field is not a `ChronoField`, then the result of this method
    is obtained by invoking `TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)`
    passing `this` as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
    and what the value represents, is determined by the field.

    Specified by:
    :   `getLong` in interface `TemporalAccessor`

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the field to get, not null

    Returns:
    :   the value for the field

  + ### query

    public <R> R query([TemporalQuery](temporal/TemporalQuery.md "interface in java.time.temporal")<R> query)

    Queries this month-of-year using the specified query.

    This queries this month-of-year using the specified query strategy object.
    The `TemporalQuery` object defines the logic to be used to
    obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
    what the result of this method will be.

    The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
    [`TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)`](temporal/TemporalQuery.md#queryFrom(java.time.temporal.TemporalAccessor)) method on the
    specified query passing `this` as the argument.

    Specified by:
    :   `query` in interface `TemporalAccessor`

    Type Parameters:
    :   `R` - the type of the result

    Parameters:
    :   `query` - the query to invoke, not null

    Returns:
    :   the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if unable to query (defined by the query)
    :   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)
  + ### adjustInto

    public [Temporal](temporal/Temporal.md "interface in java.time.temporal") adjustInto([Temporal](temporal/Temporal.md "interface in java.time.temporal") temporal)

    Adjusts the specified temporal object to have this month-of-year.

    This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
    with the month-of-year changed to be the same as this.

    The adjustment is equivalent to using [`Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)`](temporal/Temporal.md#with(java.time.temporal.TemporalField,long))
    passing [`ChronoField.MONTH_OF_YEAR`](temporal/ChronoField.md#MONTH_OF_YEAR) as the field.
    If the specified temporal object does not use the ISO calendar system then
    a `DateTimeException` is thrown.

    In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using
    [`Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)`](temporal/Temporal.md#with(java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjuster)):

    ```
       // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
       temporal = thisMonth.adjustInto(temporal);
       temporal = temporal.with(thisMonth);
    ```

    For example, given a date in May, the following are output:

    ```
       dateInMay.with(JANUARY);    // four months earlier
       dateInMay.with(APRIL);      // one months earlier
       dateInMay.with(MAY);        // same date
       dateInMay.with(JUNE);       // one month later
       dateInMay.with(DECEMBER);   // seven months later
    ```

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Specified by:
    :   `adjustInto` in interface `TemporalAdjuster`

    Parameters:
    :   `temporal` - the target object to be adjusted, not null

    Returns:
    :   the adjusted object, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if unable to make the adjustment
    :   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs
