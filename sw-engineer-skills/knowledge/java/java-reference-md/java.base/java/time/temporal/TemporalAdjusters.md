public final class TemporalAdjusters
extends [Object](../../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")

Common and useful TemporalAdjusters.

Adjusters are a key tool for modifying temporal objects.
They exist to externalize the process of adjustment, permitting different
approaches, as per the strategy design pattern.
Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding weekends, or one that
sets the date to the last day of the month.

There are two equivalent ways of using a `TemporalAdjuster`.
The first is to invoke the method on the interface directly.
The second is to use [`Temporal.with(TemporalAdjuster)`](Temporal.md#with(java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjuster)):

```
   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
   temporal = thisAdjuster.adjustInto(temporal);
   temporal = temporal.with(thisAdjuster);
```

It is recommended to use the second approach, `with(TemporalAdjuster)`,
as it is a lot clearer to read in code.

This class contains a standard set of adjusters, available as static methods.
These include:

* finding the first or last day of the month* finding the first day of next month* finding the first or last day of the year* finding the first day of next year* finding the first or last day-of-week within a month, such as "first Wednesday in June"* finding the next or previous day-of-week, such as "next Thursday"

* ## Method Details

  + ### ofDateAdjuster

    public static [TemporalAdjuster](TemporalAdjuster.md "interface in java.time.temporal") ofDateAdjuster([UnaryOperator](../../util/function/UnaryOperator.md "interface in java.util.function")<[LocalDate](../LocalDate.md "class in java.time")> dateBasedAdjuster)

    Obtains a `TemporalAdjuster` that wraps a date adjuster.

    The `TemporalAdjuster` is based on the low level `Temporal` interface.
    This method allows an adjustment from `LocalDate` to `LocalDate`
    to be wrapped to match the temporal-based interface.
    This is provided for convenience to make user-written adjusters simpler.

    In general, user-written adjusters should be static constants:

    ```
      static TemporalAdjuster TWO_DAYS_LATER =
           TemporalAdjusters.ofDateAdjuster(date -> date.plusDays(2));
    ```

    Parameters:
    :   `dateBasedAdjuster` - the date-based adjuster, not null

    The input 2011-12-15 for (FRIDAY) will return 2011-12-30.  

    The behavior is suitable for use with most calendar systems.
    It uses the `DAY_OF_WEEK` and `DAY_OF_MONTH` fields
    and the `DAYS` unit, and assumes a seven day week.

    Parameters:
    :   `dayOfWeek` - the day-of-week, not null

    Returns:
    :   the first in month adjuster, not null
  + ### dayOfWeekInMonth

    public static [TemporalAdjuster](TemporalAdjuster.md "interface in java.time.temporal") dayOfWeekInMonth(int ordinal,
    [DayOfWeek](../DayOfWeek.md "enum class in java.time") dayOfWeek)

    Returns the day-of-week in month adjuster, which returns a new date
    with the ordinal day-of-week based on the month.
    This is used for expressions like the 'second Tuesday in March'.

    The ISO calendar system behaves as follows:  
    The input 2011-12-15 for (1,TUESDAY) will return 2011-12-06.  
    The input 2011-12-15 for (2,TUESDAY) will return 2011-12-13.  
    The input 2011-12-15 for (3,TUESDAY) will return 2011-12-20.

    The input 2011-12-15 for (-1,TUESDAY) will return 2011-12-27 (last in month).  
    The input 2011-12-15 for (-4,TUESDAY) will return 2011-12-06 (3 weeks before last in month).  
    The input 2011-12-15 for (-5,TUESDAY) will return 2011-11-29 (4 weeks before last in month).  
    The input 2011-12-15 for (0,TUESDAY) will return 2011-11-29 (last in previous month).  

    For a positive or zero ordinal, the algorithm is equivalent to finding the first
    day-of-week that matches within the month and then adding a number of weeks to it.
    For a negative ordinal, the algorithm is equivalent to finding the last
    day-of-week that matches within the month and then subtracting a number of weeks to it.
    The ordinal number of weeks is not validated and is interpreted leniently
    according to this algorithm. This definition means that an ordinal of zero finds
    the last matching day-of-week in the previous month.

    The behavior is suitable for use with most calendar systems.
    It uses the `DAY_OF_WEEK` and `DAY_OF_MONTH` fields
    and the `DAYS` unit, and assumes a seven day week.
