public enum ChronoField
extends [Enum](../../lang/Enum.md "class in java.lang")<[ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal")>
implements [TemporalField](TemporalField.md "interface in java.time.temporal")

A standard set of fields.

This set of fields provide field-based access to manipulate a date, time or date-time.
The standard set of fields can be extended by implementing [`TemporalField`](TemporalField.md "interface in java.time.temporal").

These fields are intended to be applicable in multiple calendar systems.
For example, most non-ISO calendar systems define dates as a year, month and day,
just with slightly different rules.
The documentation of each field explains how it operates.

  + ### NANO\_OF\_SECOND

    public static final [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") NANO\_OF\_SECOND

    The nano-of-second.

    This counts the nanosecond within the second, from 0 to 999,999,999.
    This field has the same meaning for all calendar systems.

    This field is used to represent the nano-of-second handling any fraction of the second.
    Implementations of `TemporalAccessor` should provide a value for this field if
    they can return a value for [`SECOND_OF_MINUTE`](#SECOND_OF_MINUTE), [`SECOND_OF_DAY`](#SECOND_OF_DAY) or
    [`INSTANT_SECONDS`](#INSTANT_SECONDS) filling unknown precision with zero.

    When this field is used for setting a value, it should set as much precision as the
    object stores, using integer division to remove excess precision.
    For example, if the `TemporalAccessor` stores time to millisecond precision,
    then the nano-of-second must be divided by 1,000,000 before replacing the milli-of-second.

    `HOUR_OF_AMPM` (if not present, it defaults to '6') to form
    `HOUR_OF_DAY` by multiplying the `AMPM_OF_DAY` value
    by 12.
  + ### DAY\_OF\_WEEK

    public static final [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") DAY\_OF\_WEEK

    The day-of-week, such as Tuesday.

    This represents the standard concept of the day of the week.
    In the default ISO calendar system, this has values from Monday (1) to Sunday (7).
    The [`DayOfWeek`](../DayOfWeek.md "enum class in java.time") class can be used to interpret the result.

    Most non-ISO calendar systems also define a seven day week that aligns with ISO.
    Those calendar systems must also use the same numbering system, from Monday (1) to
    Sunday (7), which allows `DayOfWeek` to be used.

    Calendar systems that do not have a standard seven day week should implement this field
    if they have a similar concept of named or numbered days within a period similar
    to a week. It is recommended that the numbering starts from 1.
  + ### ALIGNED\_DAY\_OF\_WEEK\_IN\_MONTH

    public static final [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") ALIGNED\_DAY\_OF\_WEEK\_IN\_MONTH

    The aligned day-of-week within a month.

    This represents concept of the count of days within the period of a week
    where the weeks are aligned to the start of the month.
    This field is typically used with [`ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH`](#ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH).

    For example, in a calendar systems with a seven day week, the first aligned-week-of-month
    starts on day-of-month 1, the second aligned-week starts on day-of-month 8, and so on.
    Within each of these aligned-weeks, the days are numbered from 1 to 7 and returned
    as the value of this field.
    As such, day-of-month 1 to 7 will have aligned-day-of-week values from 1 to 7.
    And day-of-month 8 to 14 will repeat this with aligned-day-of-week values from 1 to 7.

    Calendar systems that do not have a seven day week should typically implement this
    field in the same way, but using the alternate week length.
  + ### ALIGNED\_DAY\_OF\_WEEK\_IN\_YEAR

    public static final [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") ALIGNED\_DAY\_OF\_WEEK\_IN\_YEAR

    The aligned day-of-week within a year.

    This represents concept of the count of days within the period of a week
    where the weeks are aligned to the start of the year.
    This field is typically used with [`ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR`](#ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR).

    For example, in a calendar systems with a seven day week, the first aligned-week-of-year
    starts on day-of-year 1, the second aligned-week starts on day-of-year 8, and so on.
    Within each of these aligned-weeks, the days are numbered from 1 to 7 and returned
    as the value of this field.
    As such, day-of-year 1 to 7 will have aligned-day-of-week values from 1 to 7.
    And day-of-year 8 to 14 will repeat this with aligned-day-of-week values from 1 to 7.

    Calendar systems that do not have a seven day week should typically implement this
    field in the same way, but using the alternate week length.
  + ### DAY\_OF\_MONTH

    public static final [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") DAY\_OF\_MONTH

    The day-of-month.

    This represents the concept of the day within the month.
    In the default ISO calendar system, this has values from 1 to 31 in most months.
    April, June, September, November have days from 1 to 30, while February has days
    from 1 to 28, or 29 in a leap year.

    Non-ISO calendar systems should implement this field using the most recognized
    day-of-month values for users of the calendar system.
    Normally, this is a count of days from 1 to the length of the month.
  + ### DAY\_OF\_YEAR

    public static final [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") DAY\_OF\_YEAR

    The day-of-year.

    This represents the concept of the day within the year.
    In the default ISO calendar system, this has values from 1 to 365 in standard
    years and 1 to 366 in leap years.

    Non-ISO calendar systems should implement this field using the most recognized
    day-of-year values for users of the calendar system.
    Normally, this is a count of days from 1 to the length of the year.

    Note that a non-ISO calendar system may have year numbering system that changes
    at a different point to the natural reset in the month numbering. An example
    of this is the Japanese calendar system where a change of era, which resets
    the year number to 1, can happen on any date. The era and year reset also cause
    the day-of-year to be reset to 1, but not the month-of-year or day-of-month.
  + ### EPOCH\_DAY

    public static final [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") EPOCH\_DAY

    The epoch-day, based on the Java epoch of 1970-01-01 (ISO).

    This field is the sequential count of days where 1970-01-01 (ISO) is zero.
    Note that this uses the *local* time-line, ignoring offset and time-zone.

    This field is strictly defined to have the same meaning in all calendar systems.
    This is necessary to ensure interoperation between calendars.

    Range of EpochDay is between (LocalDate.MIN.toEpochDay(), LocalDate.MAX.toEpochDay())
    both inclusive.
  + ### ALIGNED\_WEEK\_OF\_MONTH

    public static final [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") ALIGNED\_WEEK\_OF\_MONTH

    The aligned week within a month.

    This represents concept of the count of weeks within the period of a month
    where the weeks are aligned to the start of the month.
    This field is typically used with [`ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH`](#ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH).

    For example, in a calendar systems with a seven day week, the first aligned-week-of-month
    starts on day-of-month 1, the second aligned-week starts on day-of-month 8, and so on.
    Thus, day-of-month values 1 to 7 are in aligned-week 1, while day-of-month values
    8 to 14 are in aligned-week 2, and so on.

    Calendar systems that do not have a seven day week should typically implement this
    field in the same way, but using the alternate week length.
  + ### ALIGNED\_WEEK\_OF\_YEAR

    public static final [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") ALIGNED\_WEEK\_OF\_YEAR

    The aligned week within a year.

    This represents concept of the count of weeks within the period of a year
    where the weeks are aligned to the start of the year.
    This field is typically used with [`ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_YEAR`](#ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_YEAR).

    For example, in a calendar systems with a seven day week, the first aligned-week-of-year
    starts on day-of-year 1, the second aligned-week starts on day-of-year 8, and so on.
    Thus, day-of-year values 1 to 7 are in aligned-week 1, while day-of-year values
    8 to 14 are in aligned-week 2, and so on.

    Calendar systems that do not have a seven day week should typically implement this
    field in the same way, but using the alternate week length.
  + ### MONTH\_OF\_YEAR

    public static final [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") MONTH\_OF\_YEAR

    The month-of-year, such as March.

    This represents the concept of the month within the year.
    In the default ISO calendar system, this has values from January (1) to December (12).

    Non-ISO calendar systems should implement this field using the most recognized
    month-of-year values for users of the calendar system.
    Normally, this is a count of months starting from 1.
  + ### PROLEPTIC\_MONTH

    public static final [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") PROLEPTIC\_MONTH

    The proleptic-month based, counting months sequentially from year 0.

    This field is the sequential count of months where the first month
    in proleptic-year zero has the value zero.
    Later months have increasingly larger values.
    Earlier months have increasingly small values.
    There are no gaps or breaks in the sequence of months.
    Note that this uses the *local* time-line, ignoring offset and time-zone.

    In the default ISO calendar system, June 2012 would have the value
    `(2012 * 12 + 6 - 1)`. This field is primarily for internal use.

    Non-ISO calendar systems must implement this field as per the definition above.
    It is just a simple zero-based count of elapsed months from the start of proleptic-year 0.
    All calendar systems with a full proleptic-year definition will have a year zero.
    If the calendar system has a minimum year that excludes year zero, then one must
    be extrapolated in order for this method to be defined.
  + ### YEAR\_OF\_ERA

    public static final [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") YEAR\_OF\_ERA

    The year within the era.

    This represents the concept of the year within the era.
    This field is typically used with [`ERA`](#ERA).

    The standard mental model for a date is based on three concepts - year, month and day.
    These map onto the `YEAR`, `MONTH_OF_YEAR` and `DAY_OF_MONTH` fields.
    Note that there is no reference to eras.
    The full model for a date requires four concepts - era, year, month and day. These map onto
    the `ERA`, `YEAR_OF_ERA`, `MONTH_OF_YEAR` and `DAY_OF_MONTH` fields.
    Whether this field or `YEAR` is used depends on which mental model is being used.
    See [`ChronoLocalDate`](../chrono/ChronoLocalDate.md "interface in java.time.chrono") for more discussion on this topic.

    In the default ISO calendar system, there are two eras defined, 'BCE' and 'CE'.
    The era 'CE' is the one currently in use and year-of-era runs from 1 to the maximum value.
    The era 'BCE' is the previous era, and the year-of-era runs backwards.

    For example, subtracting a year each time yield the following:  
    - year-proleptic 2 = 'CE' year-of-era 2  
    - year-proleptic 1 = 'CE' year-of-era 1  
    - year-proleptic 0 = 'BCE' year-of-era 1  
    - year-proleptic -1 = 'BCE' year-of-era 2  

    Note that the ISO-8601 standard does not actually define eras.
    Note also that the ISO eras do not align with the well-known AD/BC eras due to the
    change between the Julian and Gregorian calendar systems.

    Non-ISO calendar systems should implement this field using the most recognized
    year-of-era value for users of the calendar system.
    Since most calendar systems have only two eras, the year-of-era numbering approach
    will typically be the same as that used by the ISO calendar system.
    The year-of-era value should typically always be positive, however this is not required.
  + ### YEAR

    public static final [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") YEAR

    The proleptic year, such as 2012.

    This represents the concept of the year, counting sequentially and using negative numbers.
    The proleptic year is not interpreted in terms of the era.
    See [`YEAR_OF_ERA`](#YEAR_OF_ERA) for an example showing the mapping from proleptic year to year-of-era.

    The standard mental model for a date is based on three concepts - year, month and day.
    These map onto the `YEAR`, `MONTH_OF_YEAR` and `DAY_OF_MONTH` fields.
    Note that there is no reference to eras.
    The full model for a date requires four concepts - era, year, month and day. These map onto
    the `ERA`, `YEAR_OF_ERA`, `MONTH_OF_YEAR` and `DAY_OF_MONTH` fields.
    Whether this field or `YEAR_OF_ERA` is used depends on which mental model is being used.
    See [`ChronoLocalDate`](../chrono/ChronoLocalDate.md "interface in java.time.chrono") for more discussion on this topic.

    Non-ISO calendar systems should implement this field as follows.
    If the calendar system has only two eras, before and after a fixed date, then the
    proleptic-year value must be the same as the year-of-era value for the later era,
    and increasingly negative for the earlier era.
    If the calendar system has more than two eras, then the proleptic-year value may be
    defined with any appropriate value, although defining it to be the same as ISO may be
    the best option.
  + ### ERA

    public static final [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") ERA

    The era.

    This represents the concept of the era, which is the largest division of the time-line.
    This field is typically used with [`YEAR_OF_ERA`](#YEAR_OF_ERA).

    In the default ISO calendar system, there are two eras defined, 'BCE' and 'CE'.
    The era 'CE' is the one currently in use and year-of-era runs from 1 to the maximum value.
    The era 'BCE' is the previous era, and the year-of-era runs backwards.
    See [`YEAR_OF_ERA`](#YEAR_OF_ERA) for a full example.

    Non-ISO calendar systems should implement this field to define eras.
    The value of the era that was active on 1970-01-01 (ISO) must be assigned the value 1.
    Earlier eras must have sequentially smaller values.
    Later eras must have sequentially larger values,
  + ### INSTANT\_SECONDS

    public static final [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") INSTANT\_SECONDS

    The instant epoch-seconds.

    This represents the concept of the sequential count of seconds where
    1970-01-01T00:00Z (ISO) is zero.
    This field may be used with [`NANO_OF_SECOND`](#NANO_OF_SECOND) to represent the fraction of the second.

    An [`Instant`](../Instant.md "class in java.time") represents an instantaneous point on the time-line.
    On their own, an instant has insufficient information to allow a local date-time to be obtained.
    Only when paired with an offset or time-zone can the local date or time be calculated.

    This field is strictly defined to have the same meaning in all calendar systems.
    This is necessary to ensure interoperation between calendars.
  + ### OFFSET\_SECONDS

    public static final [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") OFFSET\_SECONDS

    The offset from UTC/Greenwich.

    This represents the concept of the offset in seconds of local time from UTC/Greenwich.

    A [`ZoneOffset`](../ZoneOffset.md "class in java.time") represents the period of time that local time differs from UTC/Greenwich.
    This is usually a fixed number of hours and minutes.
    It is equivalent to the [`total amount`](../ZoneOffset.md#getTotalSeconds()) of the offset in seconds.
    For example, during the winter Paris has an offset of `+01:00`, which is 3600 seconds.

    This field is strictly defined to have the same meaning in all calendar systems.
    This is necessary to ensure interoperation between calendars.
* ## Method Details

  + ### values

    public static [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal")[] values()

    Returns an array containing the constants of this enum class, in
    the order they are declared.

    Returns:
    :   an array containing the constants of this enum class, in the order they are declared
  + ### valueOf

    public static [ChronoField](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") valueOf([String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") name)

    Returns the enum constant of this class with the specified name.
    The string must match *exactly* an identifier used to declare an
    enum constant in this class. (Extraneous whitespace characters are
    not permitted.)

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - the name of the enum constant to be returned.

    Returns:
    :   the enum constant with the specified name

    Throws:
    :   `IllegalArgumentException` - if this enum class has no constant with the specified name
    :   `NullPointerException` - if the argument is null
  + ### getDisplayName

    public [String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") getDisplayName([Locale](../../util/Locale.md "class in java.util") locale)

    Description copied from interface: `TemporalField`

    Gets the display name for the field in the requested locale.

    If there is no display name for the locale then a suitable default must be returned.

    The default implementation must check the locale is not null
    and return `toString()`.

    Specified by:
    :   `getDisplayName` in interface `TemporalField`

    Parameters:
    :   `locale` - the locale to use, not null

    Returns:
    :   the display name for the locale or a suitable default, not null
  + ### getBaseUnit

    public [TemporalUnit](TemporalUnit.md "interface in java.time.temporal") getBaseUnit()

    Description copied from interface: `TemporalField`

    Gets the unit that the field is measured in.

    The unit of the field is the period that varies within the range.
    For example, in the field 'MonthOfYear', the unit is 'Months'.
    See also [`TemporalField.getRangeUnit()`](TemporalField.md#getRangeUnit()).

    Specified by:
    :   `getBaseUnit` in interface `TemporalField`

    Returns:
    :   the unit defining the base unit of the field, not null
  + ### getRangeUnit

    public [TemporalUnit](TemporalUnit.md "interface in java.time.temporal") getRangeUnit()

    Description copied from interface: `TemporalField`

    Gets the range that the field is bound by.

    The range of the field is the period that the field varies within.
    For example, in the field 'MonthOfYear', the range is 'Years'.
    See also [`TemporalField.getBaseUnit()`](TemporalField.md#getBaseUnit()).

    The range is never null. For example, the 'Year' field is shorthand for
    'YearOfForever'. It therefore has a unit of 'Years' and a range of 'Forever'.

    Specified by:
    :   `getRangeUnit` in interface `TemporalField`

    Returns:
    :   the unit defining the range of the field, not null
  + ### range

    public [ValueRange](ValueRange.md "class in java.time.temporal") range()

    Gets the range of valid values for the field.

    All fields can be expressed as a `long` integer.
    This method returns an object that describes the valid range for that value.

    This method returns the range of the field in the ISO-8601 calendar system.
    This range may be incorrect for other calendar systems.
    Use [`Chronology.range(ChronoField)`](../chrono/Chronology.md#range(java.time.temporal.ChronoField)) to access the correct range
    for a different calendar system.

    Note that the result only describes the minimum and maximum valid values
    and it is important not to read too much into them. For example, there
    could be values within the range that are invalid for the field.

    Specified by:
    :   `range` in interface `TemporalField`

    Returns:
    :   the range of valid values for the field, not null
  + ### isDateBased

    public boolean isDateBased()

    Checks if this field represents a component of a date.

    Fields from day-of-week to era are date-based.

    Specified by:
    :   `isDateBased` in interface `TemporalField`

    Returns:
    :   true if it is a component of a date
  + ### isTimeBased

    public boolean isTimeBased()

    Checks if this field represents a component of a time.

    Fields from nano-of-second to am-pm-of-day are time-based.

    Specified by:
    :   `isTimeBased` in interface `TemporalField`

    Returns:
    :   true if it is a component of a time
  + ### checkValidValue

    public long checkValidValue(long value)

    Checks that the specified value is valid for this field.

    This validates that the value is within the outer range of valid values
    returned by [`range()`](#range()).

    This method checks against the range of the field in the ISO-8601 calendar system.
    This range may be incorrect for other calendar systems.
    Use [`Chronology.range(ChronoField)`](../chrono/Chronology.md#range(java.time.temporal.ChronoField)) to access the correct range
    for a different calendar system.

    Parameters:
    :   `value` - the value to check

    Returns:
    :   the value that was passed in
  + ### checkValidIntValue

    public int checkValidIntValue(long value)

    Checks that the specified value is valid and fits in an `int`.

    This validates that the value is within the outer range of valid values
    returned by [`range()`](#range()).
    It also checks that all valid values are within the bounds of an `int`.

    This method checks against the range of the field in the ISO-8601 calendar system.
    This range may be incorrect for other calendar systems.
    Use [`Chronology.range(ChronoField)`](../chrono/Chronology.md#range(java.time.temporal.ChronoField)) to access the correct range
    for a different calendar system.

    Parameters:
    :   `value` - the value to check

    Returns:
    :   the value that was passed in
  + ### isSupportedBy

    public boolean isSupportedBy([TemporalAccessor](TemporalAccessor.md "interface in java.time.temporal") temporal)

    Description copied from interface: `TemporalField`

    Checks if this field is supported by the temporal object.

    This determines whether the temporal accessor supports this field.
    If this returns false, then the temporal cannot be queried for this field.

    There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
    The first is to invoke this method directly.
    The second is to use [`TemporalAccessor.isSupported(TemporalField)`](TemporalAccessor.md#isSupported(java.time.temporal.TemporalField)):

    ```
       // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
       temporal = thisField.isSupportedBy(temporal);
       temporal = temporal.isSupported(thisField);
    ```

    It is recommended to use the second approach, `isSupported(TemporalField)`,
    as it is a lot clearer to read in code.

    Implementations should determine whether they are supported using the fields
    available in [`ChronoField`](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal").

    Specified by:
    :   `isSupportedBy` in interface `TemporalField`

    Parameters:
    :   `temporal` - the temporal object to query, not null

    Returns:
    :   true if the date-time can be queried for this field, false if not
  + ### rangeRefinedBy

    public [ValueRange](ValueRange.md "class in java.time.temporal") rangeRefinedBy([TemporalAccessor](TemporalAccessor.md "interface in java.time.temporal") temporal)

    Description copied from interface: `TemporalField`

    Get the range of valid values for this field using the temporal object to
    refine the result.

    This uses the temporal object to find the range of valid values for the field.
    This is similar to [`TemporalField.range()`](TemporalField.md#range()), however this method refines the result
    using the temporal. For example, if the field is `DAY_OF_MONTH` the
    `range` method is not accurate as there are four possible month lengths,
    28, 29, 30 and 31 days. Using this method with a date allows the range to be
    accurate, returning just one of those four options.

    There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
    The first is to invoke this method directly.
    The second is to use [`TemporalAccessor.range(TemporalField)`](TemporalAccessor.md#range(java.time.temporal.TemporalField)):

    ```
       // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
       temporal = thisField.rangeRefinedBy(temporal);
       temporal = temporal.range(thisField);
    ```

    It is recommended to use the second approach, `range(TemporalField)`,
    as it is a lot clearer to read in code.

    Implementations should perform any queries or calculations using the fields
    available in [`ChronoField`](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal").
    If the field is not supported an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` must be thrown.

    Specified by:
    :   `rangeRefinedBy` in interface `TemporalField`

    Parameters:
    :   `temporal` - the temporal object used to refine the result, not null

    Returns:
    :   the range of valid values for this field, not null
  + ### getFrom

    public long getFrom([TemporalAccessor](TemporalAccessor.md "interface in java.time.temporal") temporal)

    Description copied from interface: `TemporalField`

    Gets the value of this field from the specified temporal object.

    This queries the temporal object for the value of this field.

    There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
    The first is to invoke this method directly.
    The second is to use [`TemporalAccessor.getLong(TemporalField)`](TemporalAccessor.md#getLong(java.time.temporal.TemporalField))
    (or [`TemporalAccessor.get(TemporalField)`](TemporalAccessor.md#get(java.time.temporal.TemporalField))):

    ```
       // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
       temporal = thisField.getFrom(temporal);
       temporal = temporal.getLong(thisField);
    ```

    It is recommended to use the second approach, `getLong(TemporalField)`,
    as it is a lot clearer to read in code.

    Implementations should perform any queries or calculations using the fields
    available in [`ChronoField`](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal").
    If the field is not supported an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` must be thrown.

    Specified by:
    :   `getFrom` in interface `TemporalField`

    Parameters:
    :   `temporal` - the temporal object to query, not null

    Returns:
    :   the value of this field, not null
  + ### adjustInto

    public <R extends [Temporal](Temporal.md "interface in java.time.temporal")> R adjustInto(R temporal,
    long newValue)

    Description copied from interface: `TemporalField`

    Returns a copy of the specified temporal object with the value of this field set.

    This returns a new temporal object based on the specified one with the value for
    this field changed. For example, on a `LocalDate`, this could be used to
    set the year, month or day-of-month.
    The returned object has the same observable type as the specified object.

    In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
    a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.
    In cases like this, the implementation is responsible for resolving the result.
    Typically it will choose the previous valid date, which would be the last valid
    day of February in this example.

    There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
    The first is to invoke this method directly.
    The second is to use [`Temporal.with(TemporalField, long)`](Temporal.md#with(java.time.temporal.TemporalField,long)):

    ```
       // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
       temporal = thisField.adjustInto(temporal);
       temporal = temporal.with(thisField);
    ```

    It is recommended to use the second approach, `with(TemporalField)`,
    as it is a lot clearer to read in code.

    Implementations should perform any queries or calculations using the fields
    available in [`ChronoField`](ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal").
    If the field is not supported an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` must be thrown.

    Implementations must not alter the specified temporal object.
    Instead, an adjusted copy of the original must be returned.
    This provides equivalent, safe behavior for immutable and mutable implementations.

    Specified by:
    :   `adjustInto` in interface `TemporalField`

    Type Parameters:
    :   `R` - the type of the Temporal object

    Parameters:
    :   `temporal` - the temporal object to adjust, not null
    :   `newValue` - the new value of the field

    Returns:
    :   the adjusted temporal object, not null
  + ### toString

    public [String](../../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Description copied from class: `Enum`

    Returns the name of this enum constant, as contained in the
    declaration. This method may be overridden, though it typically
    isn't necessary or desirable. An enum class should override this
    method when a more "programmer-friendly" string form exists.

    Specified by:
    :   `toString` in interface `TemporalField`

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Enum<ChronoField>`

    Returns:
    :   the name of this enum constant
