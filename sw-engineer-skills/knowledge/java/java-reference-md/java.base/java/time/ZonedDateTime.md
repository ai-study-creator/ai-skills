public final class ZonedDateTime
extends [Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Temporal](temporal/Temporal.md "interface in java.time.temporal"), [ChronoZonedDateTime](chrono/ChronoZonedDateTime.md "interface in java.time.chrono")<[LocalDate](LocalDate.md "class in java.time")>, [Serializable](../io/Serializable.md "interface in java.io")

A date-time with a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
such as `2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00 Europe/Paris`.

`ZonedDateTime` is an immutable representation of a date-time with a time-zone.
This class stores all date and time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,
and a time-zone, with a zone offset used to handle ambiguous local date-times.
For example, the value
"2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789 +02:00 in the Europe/Paris time-zone"
can be stored in a `ZonedDateTime`.

This class handles conversion from the local time-line of `LocalDateTime`
to the instant time-line of `Instant`.
The difference between the two time-lines is the offset from UTC/Greenwich,
represented by a `ZoneOffset`.

Converting between the two time-lines involves calculating the offset using the
[`rules`](zone/ZoneRules.md "class in java.time.zone") accessed from the `ZoneId`.
Obtaining the offset for an instant is simple, as there is exactly one valid
offset for each instant. By contrast, obtaining the offset for a local date-time
is not straightforward. There are three cases:

* Normal, with one valid offset. For the vast majority of the year, the normal
  case applies, where there is a single valid offset for the local date-time.
* Gap, with zero valid offsets. This is when clocks jump forward typically
  due to the spring daylight savings change from "winter" to "summer".
  In a gap there are local date-time values with no valid offset.
* Overlap, with two valid offsets. This is when clocks are set back typically
  due to the autumn daylight savings change from "summer" to "winter".
  In an overlap there are local date-time values with two valid offsets.

Any method that converts directly or implicitly from a local date-time to an
instant by obtaining the offset has the potential to be complicated.

For Gaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the
middle of a Gap, then the resulting zoned date-time will have a local date-time
shifted forwards by the length of the Gap, resulting in a date-time in the later
offset, typically "summer" time.

For Overlaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the
middle of an Overlap, then the previous offset will be retained. If there is no
previous offset, or the previous offset is invalid, then the earlier offset is
used, typically "summer" time.. Two additional methods,
[`withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()`](#withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()) and [`withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()`](#withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()),
help manage the case of an overlap.

In terms of design, this class should be viewed primarily as the combination
of a `LocalDateTime` and a `ZoneId`. The `ZoneOffset` is
a vital, but secondary, piece of information, used to ensure that the class
represents an instant, especially during a daylight savings overlap.

This is a [value-based](../../../java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.md)
class; programmers should treat instances that are
[equal](#equals(java.lang.Object)) as interchangeable and should not
use instances for synchronization, or unpredictable behavior may
occur. For example, in a future release, synchronization may fail.
The `equals` method should be used for comparisons.

  + ### now

    public static [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") now()

    Obtains the current date-time from the system clock in the default time-zone.

    This will query the [`system clock`](Clock.md#systemDefaultZone()) in the default
    time-zone to obtain the current date-time.
    The zone and offset will be set based on the time-zone in the clock.

    Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
    because the clock is hard-coded.

    Returns:
    :   the current date-time using the system clock, not null
  + ### now

    public static [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") now([ZoneId](ZoneId.md "class in java.time") zone)

    Obtains the current date-time from the system clock in the specified time-zone.

    This will query the [`system clock`](Clock.md#system(java.time.ZoneId)) to obtain the current date-time.
    Specifying the time-zone avoids dependence on the default time-zone.
    The offset will be calculated from the specified time-zone.

    Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing
    because the clock is hard-coded.

    Parameters:
    :   `zone` - the zone ID to use, not null

    Returns:
    :   the current date-time using the system clock, not null
  + ### now

    public static [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") now([Clock](Clock.md "class in java.time") clock)

    Obtains the current date-time from the specified clock.

    This will query the specified clock to obtain the current date-time.
    The zone and offset will be set based on the time-zone in the clock.

    Using this method allows the use of an alternate clock for testing.
    The alternate clock may be introduced using [`dependency injection`](Clock.md "class in java.time").

    Parameters:
    :   `clock` - the clock to use, not null

    Returns:
    :   the current date-time, not null

    [LocalTime](LocalTime.md "class in java.time") time,
    [ZoneId](ZoneId.md "class in java.time") zone)

    Obtains an instance of `ZonedDateTime` from a local date and time.

    This creates a zoned date-time matching the input local date and time as closely as possible.
    Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
    is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.

    The local date time and first combined to form a local date-time.
    The local date-time is then resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
    This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
    date-time as defined by the [`rules`](zone/ZoneRules.md "class in java.time.zone") of the zone ID.

    In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
    In the case of an overlap, when clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
    This method uses the earlier offset typically corresponding to "summer".

    In the case of a gap, when clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
    Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
    For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
    moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".

    Parameters:
    :   `date` - the local date, not null
    :   `time` - the local time, not null
    :   `zone` - the time-zone, not null

    [ZoneId](ZoneId.md "class in java.time") zone)

    Obtains an instance of `ZonedDateTime` from a year, month, day,
    hour, minute, second, nanosecond and time-zone.

    This creates a zoned date-time matching the local date-time of the seven
    specified fields as closely as possible.
    Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
    is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.

    The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.

    For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
    moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".

    This method exists primarily for writing test cases.
    Non test-code will typically use other methods to create an offset time.
    `LocalDateTime` has five additional convenience variants of the
    equivalent factory method taking fewer arguments.
    They are not provided here to reduce the footprint of the API.

    Parameters:

  + ### ofLocal

    public static [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") ofLocal([LocalDateTime](LocalDateTime.md "class in java.time") localDateTime,
    [ZoneId](ZoneId.md "class in java.time") zone,
    [ZoneOffset](ZoneOffset.md "class in java.time") preferredOffset)

    Obtains an instance of `ZonedDateTime` from a local date-time
    using the preferred offset if possible.

    The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
    This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
    date-time as defined by the [`rules`](zone/ZoneRules.md "class in java.time.zone") of the zone ID.

    In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
    In the case of an overlap, where clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
    If the preferred offset is one of the valid offsets then it is used.
    Otherwise the earlier valid offset is used, typically corresponding to "summer".

    In the case of a gap, where clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
    Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
    For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
    moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".

    Parameters:
    :   `localDateTime` - the local date-time, not null
    :   `zone` - the time-zone, not null
    :   `preferredOffset` - the zone offset, null if no preference

    Returns:
    :   the zoned date-time, not null
  + ### ofInstant

    public static [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") ofInstant([Instant](Instant.md "class in java.time") instant,
    [ZoneId](ZoneId.md "class in java.time") zone)

    Obtains an instance of `ZonedDateTime` from an `Instant`.

    This creates a zoned date-time with the same instant as that specified.
    Calling [`ChronoZonedDateTime.toInstant()`](chrono/ChronoZonedDateTime.md#toInstant()) will return an instant equal to the one used here.

    Converting an instant to a zoned date-time is simple as there is only one valid
    offset for each instant.

    Parameters:
    :   `instant` - the instant to create the date-time from, not null
    :   `zone` - the time-zone, not null

    Returns:
    :   the zoned date-time, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the result exceeds the supported range
  + ### ofInstant

    public static [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") ofInstant([LocalDateTime](LocalDateTime.md "class in java.time") localDateTime,
    [ZoneOffset](ZoneOffset.md "class in java.time") offset,
    [ZoneId](ZoneId.md "class in java.time") zone)

    Obtains an instance of `ZonedDateTime` from the instant formed by combining
    the local date-time and offset.

    This creates a zoned date-time by [`combining`](chrono/ChronoLocalDateTime.md#toInstant(java.time.ZoneOffset))
    the `LocalDateTime` and `ZoneOffset`.
    This combination uniquely specifies an instant without ambiguity.

    Converting an instant to a zoned date-time is simple as there is only one valid
    offset for each instant. If the valid offset is different to the offset specified,
    then the date-time and offset of the zoned date-time will differ from those specified.

    If the `ZoneId` to be used is a `ZoneOffset`, this method is equivalent
    to [`of(LocalDateTime, ZoneId)`](#of(java.time.LocalDateTime,java.time.ZoneId)).

    Parameters:
    :   `localDateTime` - the local date-time, not null
    :   `offset` - the zone offset, not null
    :   `zone` - the time-zone, not null

    Returns:
    :   the zoned date-time, not null
  + ### ofStrict

    public static [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") ofStrict([LocalDateTime](LocalDateTime.md "class in java.time") localDateTime,
    [ZoneOffset](ZoneOffset.md "class in java.time") offset,
    [ZoneId](ZoneId.md "class in java.time") zone)

    Obtains an instance of `ZonedDateTime` strictly validating the
    combination of local date-time, offset and zone ID.

    This creates a zoned date-time ensuring that the offset is valid for the
    local date-time according to the rules of the specified zone.
    If the offset is invalid, an exception is thrown.

    Parameters:
    :   `localDateTime` - the local date-time, not null
    :   `offset` - the zone offset, not null
    :   `zone` - the time-zone, not null

    Returns:
    :   the zoned date-time, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the combination of arguments is invalid
  + ### from

    public static [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") from([TemporalAccessor](temporal/TemporalAccessor.md "interface in java.time.temporal") temporal)

    Obtains an instance of `ZonedDateTime` from a temporal object.

    This obtains a zoned date-time based on the specified temporal.
    A `TemporalAccessor` represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
    which this factory converts to an instance of `ZonedDateTime`.

    The conversion will first obtain a `ZoneId` from the temporal object,
    falling back to a `ZoneOffset` if necessary. It will then try to obtain
    an `Instant`, falling back to a `LocalDateTime` if necessary.
    The result will be either the combination of `ZoneId` or `ZoneOffset`
    with `Instant` or `LocalDateTime`.
    Implementations are permitted to perform optimizations such as accessing
    those fields that are equivalent to the relevant objects.

    This method matches the signature of the functional interface [`TemporalQuery`](temporal/TemporalQuery.md "interface in java.time.temporal")
    allowing it to be used as a query via method reference, `ZonedDateTime::from`.

    Parameters:
    :   `temporal` - the temporal object to convert, not null

    Returns:
    :   the zoned date-time, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if unable to convert to an `ZonedDateTime`
  + ### parse

    public static [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") parse([CharSequence](../lang/CharSequence.md "interface in java.lang") text)

    Obtains an instance of `ZonedDateTime` from a text string such as
    `2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00[Europe/Paris]`.

    The string must represent a valid date-time and is parsed using
    [`DateTimeFormatter.ISO_ZONED_DATE_TIME`](format/DateTimeFormatter.md#ISO_ZONED_DATE_TIME).

    Parameters:
    :   `text` - the text to parse such as "2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00[Europe/Paris]", not null

    Returns:
    :   the parsed zoned date-time, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeParseException` - if the text cannot be parsed
  + ### parse

    public static [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") parse([CharSequence](../lang/CharSequence.md "interface in java.lang") text,
    [DateTimeFormatter](format/DateTimeFormatter.md "class in java.time.format") formatter)

    Obtains an instance of `ZonedDateTime` from a text string using a specific formatter.

    The text is parsed using the formatter, returning a date-time.

    Parameters:
    :   `text` - the text to parse, not null
    :   `formatter` - the formatter to use, not null

    Returns:
    :   the parsed zoned date-time, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeParseException` - if the text cannot be parsed
  + ### isSupported

    public boolean isSupported([TemporalField](temporal/TemporalField.md "interface in java.time.temporal") field)

    Checks if the specified field is supported.

    This checks if this date-time can be queried for the specified field.
    If false, then calling the [`range`](#range(java.time.temporal.TemporalField)),
    [`get`](#get(java.time.temporal.TemporalField)) and [`with(TemporalField, long)`](#with(java.time.temporal.TemporalField,long))
    methods will throw an exception.

    If the field is a [`ChronoField`](temporal/ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") then the query is implemented here.
    The supported fields are:
    - `NANO_OF_SECOND`- `NANO_OF_DAY`- `MICRO_OF_SECOND`- `MICRO_OF_DAY`- `MILLI_OF_SECOND`- `MILLI_OF_DAY`- `SECOND_OF_MINUTE`- `SECOND_OF_DAY`- `MINUTE_OF_HOUR`- `MINUTE_OF_DAY`- `HOUR_OF_AMPM`- `CLOCK_HOUR_OF_AMPM`- `HOUR_OF_DAY`- `CLOCK_HOUR_OF_DAY`- `AMPM_OF_DAY`- `DAY_OF_WEEK`- `ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH`- `ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_YEAR`- `DAY_OF_MONTH`- `DAY_OF_YEAR`- `EPOCH_DAY`- `ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH`- `ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR`- `MONTH_OF_YEAR`- `PROLEPTIC_MONTH`- `YEAR_OF_ERA`- `YEAR`- `ERA`- `INSTANT_SECONDS`- `OFFSET_SECONDS`All other `ChronoField` instances will return false.

    If the field is not a `ChronoField`, then the result of this method
    is obtained by invoking `TemporalField.isSupportedBy(TemporalAccessor)`
    passing `this` as the argument.
    Whether the field is supported is determined by the field.

    Specified by:
    :   `isSupported` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Specified by:
    :   `isSupported` in interface `TemporalAccessor`

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the field to check, null returns false

    Returns:
    :   true if the field is supported on this date-time, false if not
  + ### isSupported

    public boolean isSupported([TemporalUnit](temporal/TemporalUnit.md "interface in java.time.temporal") unit)

    Checks if the specified unit is supported.

    This checks if the specified unit can be added to, or subtracted from, this date-time.
    If false, then calling the [`plus(long, TemporalUnit)`](#plus(long,java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit)) and
    [`minus`](#minus(long,java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit)) methods will throw an exception.

    If the unit is a [`ChronoUnit`](temporal/ChronoUnit.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") then the query is implemented here.
    The supported units are:
    - `NANOS`- `MICROS`- `MILLIS`- `SECONDS`- `MINUTES`- `HOURS`- `HALF_DAYS`- `DAYS`- `WEEKS`- `MONTHS`- `YEARS`- `DECADES`- `CENTURIES`- `MILLENNIA`- `ERAS`All other `ChronoUnit` instances will return false.

    If the unit is not a `ChronoUnit`, then the result of this method
    is obtained by invoking `TemporalUnit.isSupportedBy(Temporal)`
    passing `this` as the argument.
    Whether the unit is supported is determined by the unit.

    Specified by:
    :   `isSupported` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Specified by:
    :   `isSupported` in interface `Temporal`

    Parameters:
    :   `unit` - the unit to check, null returns false

    Returns:
    :   true if the unit can be added/subtracted, false if not
  + ### range

    public [ValueRange](temporal/ValueRange.md "class in java.time.temporal") range([TemporalField](temporal/TemporalField.md "interface in java.time.temporal") field)

    Gets the range of valid values for the specified field.

    The range object expresses the minimum and maximum valid values for a field.
    This date-time is used to enhance the accuracy of the returned range.
    If it is not possible to return the range, because the field is not supported
    or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

    If the field is a [`ChronoField`](temporal/ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") then the query is implemented here.
    The [`supported fields`](#isSupported(java.time.temporal.TemporalField)) will return
    appropriate range instances.
    All other `ChronoField` instances will throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.

    If the field is not a `ChronoField`, then the result of this method
    is obtained by invoking `TemporalField.rangeRefinedBy(TemporalAccessor)`
    passing `this` as the argument.
    Whether the range can be obtained is determined by the field.

    Specified by:
    :   `range` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Specified by:
    :   `range` in interface `TemporalAccessor`

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the field to query the range for, not null

    Returns:
    :   the range of valid values for the field, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the range for the field cannot be obtained
    :   `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` - if the field is not supported
  + ### get

    public int get([TemporalField](temporal/TemporalField.md "interface in java.time.temporal") field)

    Gets the value of the specified field from this date-time as an `int`.

    This queries this date-time for the value of the specified field.
    The returned value will always be within the valid range of values for the field.
    If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
    or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

    If the field is a [`ChronoField`](temporal/ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") then the query is implemented here.
    The [`supported fields`](#isSupported(java.time.temporal.TemporalField)) will return valid
    values based on this date-time, except `NANO_OF_DAY`, `MICRO_OF_DAY`,
    `EPOCH_DAY`, `PROLEPTIC_MONTH` and `INSTANT_SECONDS` which are too
    large to fit in an `int` and throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.
    All other `ChronoField` instances will throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.

    If the field is not a `ChronoField`, then the result of this method
    is obtained by invoking `TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)`
    passing `this` as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
    and what the value represents, is determined by the field.

    Specified by:
    :   `get` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Specified by:
    :   `get` in interface `TemporalAccessor`

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the field to get, not null

    Returns:
    :   the value for the field

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if a value for the field cannot be obtained or
        the value is outside the range of valid values for the field
    :   `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` - if the field is not supported or
        the range of values exceeds an `int`
    :   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs
  + ### getLong

    public long getLong([TemporalField](temporal/TemporalField.md "interface in java.time.temporal") field)

    Gets the value of the specified field from this date-time as a `long`.

    This queries this date-time for the value of the specified field.
    If it is not possible to return the value, because the field is not supported
    or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

    If the field is a [`ChronoField`](temporal/ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") then the query is implemented here.
    The [`supported fields`](#isSupported(java.time.temporal.TemporalField)) will return valid
    values based on this date-time.
    All other `ChronoField` instances will throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.

    If the field is not a `ChronoField`, then the result of this method
    is obtained by invoking `TemporalField.getFrom(TemporalAccessor)`
    passing `this` as the argument. Whether the value can be obtained,
    and what the value represents, is determined by the field.

    Specified by:
    :   `getLong` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Specified by:
    :   `getLong` in interface `TemporalAccessor`

    Parameters:
    :   `field` - the field to get, not null

    Returns:
    :   the value for the field

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if a value for the field cannot be obtained
    :   `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` - if the field is not supported
    :   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs
  + ### getOffset

    public [ZoneOffset](ZoneOffset.md "class in java.time") getOffset()

    Gets the zone offset, such as '+01:00'.

    This is the offset of the local date-time from UTC/Greenwich.

    Specified by:
    :   `getOffset` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Returns:
    :   the zone offset, not null
  + ### withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()

    Returns a copy of this date-time changing the zone offset to the
    earlier of the two valid offsets at a local time-line overlap.

    This method only has any effect when the local time-line overlaps, such as
    at an autumn daylight savings cutover. In this scenario, there are two
    valid offsets for the local date-time. Calling this method will return
    a zoned date-time with the earlier of the two selected.

    If this method is called when it is not an overlap, `this`
    is returned.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Specified by:
    :   `withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on this date-time with the earlier offset, not null
  + ### withLaterOffsetAtOverlap

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()

    Returns a copy of this date-time changing the zone offset to the
    later of the two valid offsets at a local time-line overlap.

    This method only has any effect when the local time-line overlaps, such as
    at an autumn daylight savings cutover. In this scenario, there are two
    valid offsets for the local date-time. Calling this method will return
    a zoned date-time with the later of the two selected.

    If this method is called when it is not an overlap, `this`
    is returned.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Specified by:
    :   `withLaterOffsetAtOverlap` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on this date-time with the later offset, not null
  + ### getZone

    public [ZoneId](ZoneId.md "class in java.time") getZone()

    Gets the time-zone, such as 'Europe/Paris'.

    This returns the zone ID. This identifies the time-zone [`rules`](zone/ZoneRules.md "class in java.time.zone")
    that determine when and how the offset from UTC/Greenwich changes.

    The zone ID may be same as the [offset](#getOffset()).
    If this is true, then any future calculations, such as addition or subtraction,
    have no complex edge cases due to time-zone rules.
    See also [`withFixedOffsetZone()`](#withFixedOffsetZone()).

    Specified by:
    :   `getZone` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Returns:
    :   the time-zone, not null
  + ### withZoneSameLocal

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") withZoneSameLocal([ZoneId](ZoneId.md "class in java.time") zone)

    Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,
    retaining the local date-time if possible.

    This method changes the time-zone and retains the local date-time.
    The local date-time is only changed if it is invalid for the new zone,
    determined using the same approach as
    [`ofLocal(LocalDateTime, ZoneId, ZoneOffset)`](#ofLocal(java.time.LocalDateTime,java.time.ZoneId,java.time.ZoneOffset)).

    To change the zone and adjust the local date-time,
    use [`withZoneSameInstant(ZoneId)`](#withZoneSameInstant(java.time.ZoneId)).

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Specified by:
    :   `withZoneSameLocal` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Parameters:
    :   `zone` - the time-zone to change to, not null

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on this date-time with the requested zone, not null
  + ### withZoneSameInstant

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") withZoneSameInstant([ZoneId](ZoneId.md "class in java.time") zone)

    Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,
    retaining the instant.

    This method changes the time-zone and retains the instant.
    This normally results in a change to the local date-time.

    This method is based on retaining the same instant, thus gaps and overlaps
    in the local time-line have no effect on the result.

    To change the offset while keeping the local time,
    use [`withZoneSameLocal(ZoneId)`](#withZoneSameLocal(java.time.ZoneId)).

    Specified by:
    :   `withZoneSameInstant` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Parameters:
    :   `zone` - the time-zone to change to, not null

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on this date-time with the requested zone, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the result exceeds the supported date range
  + ### withFixedOffsetZone

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") withFixedOffsetZone()

    Returns a copy of this date-time with the zone ID set to the offset.

    This returns a zoned date-time where the zone ID is the same as [`getOffset()`](#getOffset()).
    The local date-time, offset and instant of the result will be the same as in this date-time.

    Setting the date-time to a fixed single offset means that any future
    calculations, such as addition or subtraction, have no complex edge cases
    due to time-zone rules.
    This might also be useful when sending a zoned date-time across a network,
    as most protocols, such as ISO-8601, only handle offsets,
    and not region-based zone IDs.

    This is equivalent to `ZonedDateTime.of(zdt.toLocalDateTime(), zdt.getOffset())`.

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` with the zone ID set to the offset, not null
  + ### toLocalDateTime

    public [LocalDateTime](LocalDateTime.md "class in java.time") toLocalDateTime()

    Gets the `LocalDateTime` part of this date-time.

    This returns a `LocalDateTime` with the same year, month, day and time
    as this date-time.

    Specified by:
    :   `toLocalDateTime` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Returns:
    :   the local date-time part of this date-time, not null
  + ### toLocalDate

    public [LocalDate](LocalDate.md "class in java.time") toLocalDate()

    Gets the `LocalDate` part of this date-time.

    This returns a `LocalDate` with the same year, month and day
    as this date-time.

    Specified by:
    :   `toLocalDate` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Returns:
    :   the date part of this date-time, not null
  + ### getYear

    public int getYear()

    Gets the year field.

    This method returns the primitive `int` value for the year.

    The year returned by this method is proleptic as per `get(YEAR)`.
    To obtain the year-of-era, use `get(YEAR_OF_ERA)`.

    Returns:
    :   the year, from MIN\_YEAR to MAX\_YEAR
  + ### getMonthValue

    public int getMonthValue()

    Gets the month-of-year field from 1 to 12.

    This method returns the month as an `int` from 1 to 12.
    Application code is frequently clearer if the enum [`Month`](Month.md "enum class in java.time")
    is used by calling [`getMonth()`](#getMonth()).

    Returns:
    :   the month-of-year, from 1 to 12

    See Also:
    :   - [`getMonth()`](#getMonth())
  + ### getMonth

    public [Month](Month.md "enum class in java.time") getMonth()

    Gets the month-of-year field using the `Month` enum.

    This method returns the enum [`Month`](Month.md "enum class in java.time") for the month.
    This avoids confusion as to what `int` values mean.
    If you need access to the primitive `int` value then the enum
    provides the [`int value`](Month.md#getValue()).

    Returns:
    :   the month-of-year, not null

    See Also:
    :   - [`getMonthValue()`](#getMonthValue())
  + ### getDayOfMonth

    public int getDayOfMonth()

    Gets the day-of-month field.

    This method returns the primitive `int` value for the day-of-month.

    Returns:
    :   the day-of-month, from 1 to 31
  + ### getDayOfYear

    public int getDayOfYear()

    Gets the day-of-year field.

    This method returns the primitive `int` value for the day-of-year.

    Returns:
    :   the day-of-year, from 1 to 365, or 366 in a leap year
  + ### getDayOfWeek

    public [DayOfWeek](DayOfWeek.md "enum class in java.time") getDayOfWeek()

    Gets the day-of-week field, which is an enum `DayOfWeek`.

    This method returns the enum [`DayOfWeek`](DayOfWeek.md "enum class in java.time") for the day-of-week.
    This avoids confusion as to what `int` values mean.
    If you need access to the primitive `int` value then the enum
    provides the [`int value`](DayOfWeek.md#getValue()).

    Additional information can be obtained from the `DayOfWeek`.
    This includes textual names of the values.

    Returns:
    :   the day-of-week, not null
  + ### toLocalTime

    public [LocalTime](LocalTime.md "class in java.time") toLocalTime()

    Gets the `LocalTime` part of this date-time.

    This returns a `LocalTime` with the same hour, minute, second and
    nanosecond as this date-time.

    Specified by:
    :   `toLocalTime` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Returns:
    :   the time part of this date-time, not null
  + ### getHour

    public int getHour()

    Gets the hour-of-day field.

    Returns:
    :   the hour-of-day, from 0 to 23
  + ### getMinute

    public int getMinute()

    Gets the minute-of-hour field.

    Returns:
    :   the minute-of-hour, from 0 to 59
  + ### getSecond

    public int getSecond()

    Gets the second-of-minute field.

    Returns:
    :   the second-of-minute, from 0 to 59
  + ### getNano

    public int getNano()

    Gets the nano-of-second field.

    Returns:
    :   the nano-of-second, from 0 to 999,999,999
  + ### with

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") with([TemporalAdjuster](temporal/TemporalAdjuster.md "interface in java.time.temporal") adjuster)

    Returns an adjusted copy of this date-time.

    This returns a `ZonedDateTime`, based on this one, with the date-time adjusted.
    The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
    Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.

    A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
    A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
    A selection of common adjustments is provided in
    [`TemporalAdjusters`](temporal/TemporalAdjusters.md "class in java.time.temporal").
    These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
    Key date-time classes also implement the `TemporalAdjuster` interface,
    such as [`Month`](Month.md "enum class in java.time") and [`MonthDay`](MonthDay.md "class in java.time").
    The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
    lengths of month and leap years.

    For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:

    ```
      import static java.time.Month.*;
      import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;

      result = zonedDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
    ```

    The classes [`LocalDate`](LocalDate.md "class in java.time") and [`LocalTime`](LocalTime.md "class in java.time") implement `TemporalAdjuster`,
    thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:

    ```
      result = zonedDateTime.with(date);
      result = zonedDateTime.with(time);
    ```

    [`ZoneOffset`](ZoneOffset.md "class in java.time") also implements `TemporalAdjuster` however using it
    as an argument typically has no effect. The offset of a `ZonedDateTime` is
    controlled primarily by the time-zone. As such, changing the offset does not generally
    make sense, because there is only one valid offset for the local date-time and zone.
    If the zoned date-time is in a daylight savings overlap, then the offset is used
    to switch between the two valid offsets. In all other cases, the offset is ignored.

    The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
    [`TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal)`](temporal/TemporalAdjuster.md#adjustInto(java.time.temporal.Temporal)) method on the
    specified adjuster passing `this` as the argument.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Specified by:
    :   `with` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Specified by:
    :   `with` in interface `Temporal`

    Parameters:
    :   `adjuster` - the adjuster to use, not null

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on `this` with the adjustment made, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the adjustment cannot be made
    :   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs
  + ### with

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") with([TemporalField](temporal/TemporalField.md "interface in java.time.temporal") field,
    long newValue)

    Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified field set to a new value.

    This returns a `ZonedDateTime`, based on this one, with the value
    for the specified field changed.
    This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
    If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
    some other reason, an exception is thrown.

    In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date-time to become invalid,
    such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
    In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
    the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.

    If the field is a [`ChronoField`](temporal/ChronoField.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") then the adjustment is implemented here.

    The `INSTANT_SECONDS` field will return a date-time with the specified instant.
    The zone and nano-of-second are unchanged.
    The result will have an offset derived from the new instant and original zone.
    If the new instant value is outside the valid range then a `DateTimeException` will be thrown.

    The `OFFSET_SECONDS` field will typically be ignored.
    The offset of a `ZonedDateTime` is controlled primarily by the time-zone.
    As such, changing the offset does not generally make sense, because there is only
    one valid offset for the local date-time and zone.
    If the zoned date-time is in a daylight savings overlap, then the offset is used
    to switch between the two valid offsets. In all other cases, the offset is ignored.
    If the new offset value is outside the valid range then a `DateTimeException` will be thrown.

    The other [`supported fields`](#isSupported(java.time.temporal.TemporalField)) will behave as per
    the matching method on [`LocalDateTime`](LocalDateTime.md#with(java.time.temporal.TemporalField,long)).
    The zone is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged.
    When converting back to `ZonedDateTime`, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
    then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
    If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

    All other `ChronoField` instances will throw an `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException`.

    If the field is not a `ChronoField`, then the result of this method
    is obtained by invoking `TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)`
    passing `this` as the argument. In this case, the field determines
    whether and how to adjust the instant.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

  + ### truncatedTo

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") truncatedTo([TemporalUnit](temporal/TemporalUnit.md "interface in java.time.temporal") unit)

    Returns a copy of this `ZonedDateTime` with the time truncated.

    Truncation returns a copy of the original date-time with fields
    smaller than the specified unit set to zero.
    For example, truncating with the [`minutes`](temporal/ChronoUnit.md#MINUTES) unit
    will set the second-of-minute and nano-of-second field to zero.

    The unit must have a [duration](temporal/TemporalUnit.md#getDuration())
    that divides into the length of a standard day without remainder.
    This includes all supplied time units on [`ChronoUnit`](temporal/ChronoUnit.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") and
    [`DAYS`](temporal/ChronoUnit.md#DAYS). Other units throw an exception.

    This operates on the local time-line,
    [`truncating`](LocalDateTime.md#truncatedTo(java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit))
    the underlying local date-time. This is then converted back to a
    `ZonedDateTime`, using the zone ID to obtain the offset.

    When converting back to `ZonedDateTime`, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
    then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
    If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Parameters:
    :   `unit` - the unit to truncate to, not null

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on this date-time with the time truncated, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if unable to truncate
    :   `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` - if the unit is not supported
  + ### plus

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") plus([TemporalAmount](temporal/TemporalAmount.md "interface in java.time.temporal") amountToAdd)

    Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified amount added.

    This returns a `ZonedDateTime`, based on this one, with the specified amount added.
    The amount is typically [`Period`](Period.md "class in java.time") or [`Duration`](Duration.md "class in java.time") but may be
    any other type implementing the [`TemporalAmount`](temporal/TemporalAmount.md "interface in java.time.temporal") interface.

    The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling
    [`TemporalAmount.addTo(Temporal)`](temporal/TemporalAmount.md#addTo(java.time.temporal.Temporal)). The amount implementation is free
    to implement the addition in any way it wishes, however it typically
    calls back to [`plus(long, TemporalUnit)`](#plus(long,java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit)). Consult the documentation
    of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully added.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Specified by:
    :   `plus` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Specified by:
    :   `plus` in interface `Temporal`

    Parameters:
    :   `amountToAdd` - the amount to add, not null

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on this date-time with the addition made, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the addition cannot be made
    :   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs
  + ### plus

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") plus(long amountToAdd,
    [TemporalUnit](temporal/TemporalUnit.md "interface in java.time.temporal") unit)

    Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified amount added.

    This returns a `ZonedDateTime`, based on this one, with the amount
    in terms of the unit added. If it is not possible to add the amount, because the
    unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

    If the field is a [`ChronoUnit`](temporal/ChronoUnit.md "enum class in java.time.temporal") then the addition is implemented here.
    The zone is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged in the result.
    The calculation for date and time units differ.

    Date units operate on the local time-line.
    The period is first added to the local date-time, then converted back
    to a zoned date-time using the zone ID.
    The conversion uses [`ofLocal(LocalDateTime, ZoneId, ZoneOffset)`](#ofLocal(java.time.LocalDateTime,java.time.ZoneId,java.time.ZoneOffset))
    with the offset before the addition.

    Time units operate on the instant time-line.
    The period is first added to the local date-time, then converted back to
    a zoned date-time using the zone ID.
    The conversion uses [`ofInstant(LocalDateTime, ZoneOffset, ZoneId)`](#ofInstant(java.time.LocalDateTime,java.time.ZoneOffset,java.time.ZoneId))
    with the offset before the addition.

    If the field is not a `ChronoUnit`, then the result of this method
    is obtained by invoking `TemporalUnit.addTo(Temporal, long)`
    passing `this` as the argument. In this case, the unit determines
    whether and how to perform the addition.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Specified by:
    :   `plus` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Specified by:
    :   `plus` in interface `Temporal`

    :   `unit` - the unit of the amount to add, not null

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on this date-time with the specified amount added, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the addition cannot be made
    :   `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` - if the unit is not supported
    :   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs
  + ### plusYears

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") plusYears(long years)

    Returns a copy of this `ZonedDateTime` with the specified number of years added.

    This operates on the local time-line,
    [`adding years`](LocalDateTime.md#plusYears(long)) to the local date-time.
    This is then converted back to a `ZonedDateTime`, using the zone ID
    to obtain the offset.

    When converting back to `ZonedDateTime`, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
    then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
    If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

  + ### plusMonths

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") plusMonths(long months)

    Returns a copy of this `ZonedDateTime` with the specified number of months added.

    This operates on the local time-line,
    [`adding months`](LocalDateTime.md#plusMonths(long)) to the local date-time.
    This is then converted back to a `ZonedDateTime`, using the zone ID
    to obtain the offset.

    When converting back to `ZonedDateTime`, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
    then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
    If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Parameters:
    :   `months` - the months to add, may be negative

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on this date-time with the months added, not null

    Throws:

  + ### plusWeeks

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") plusWeeks(long weeks)

    Returns a copy of this `ZonedDateTime` with the specified number of weeks added.

    This operates on the local time-line,
    [`adding weeks`](LocalDateTime.md#plusWeeks(long)) to the local date-time.
    This is then converted back to a `ZonedDateTime`, using the zone ID
    to obtain the offset.

    When converting back to `ZonedDateTime`, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
    then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
    If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Parameters:
    :   `weeks` - the weeks to add, may be negative

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on this date-time with the weeks added, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the result exceeds the supported date range
  + ### plusDays

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") plusDays(long days)

    Returns a copy of this `ZonedDateTime` with the specified number of days added.

    This operates on the local time-line,
    [`adding days`](LocalDateTime.md#plusDays(long)) to the local date-time.
    This is then converted back to a `ZonedDateTime`, using the zone ID
    to obtain the offset.

    When converting back to `ZonedDateTime`, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
    then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
    If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Parameters:
    :   `days` - the days to add, may be negative

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on this date-time with the days added, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the result exceeds the supported date range
  + ### plusHours

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") plusHours(long hours)

    Returns a copy of this `ZonedDateTime` with the specified number of hours added.

    This operates on the instant time-line, such that adding one hour will
    always be a duration of one hour later.
    This may cause the local date-time to change by an amount other than one hour.
    Note that this is a different approach to that used by days, months and years,
    thus adding one day is not the same as adding 24 hours.

    For example, consider a time-zone, such as 'Europe/Paris', where the
    Autumn DST cutover means that the local times 02:00 to 02:59 occur twice
    changing from offset +02:00 in summer to +01:00 in winter.
    - Adding one hour to 01:30+02:00 will result in 02:30+02:00
      (both in summer time)- Adding one hour to 02:30+02:00 will result in 02:30+01:00
        (moving from summer to winter time)- Adding one hour to 02:30+01:00 will result in 03:30+01:00
          (both in winter time)- Adding three hours to 01:30+02:00 will result in 03:30+01:00
            (moving from summer to winter time)

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Parameters:
    :   `hours` - the hours to add, may be negative

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on this date-time with the hours added, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the result exceeds the supported date range
  + ### plusMinutes

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") plusMinutes(long minutes)

    Returns a copy of this `ZonedDateTime` with the specified number of minutes added.

    This operates on the instant time-line, such that adding one minute will
    always be a duration of one minute later.
    This may cause the local date-time to change by an amount other than one minute.
    Note that this is a different approach to that used by days, months and years.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Returns a copy of this `ZonedDateTime` with the specified number of nanoseconds added.

    This operates on the instant time-line, such that adding one nano will
    always be a duration of one nano later.

    Note that this is a different approach to that used by days, months and years.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Parameters:

    This returns a `ZonedDateTime`, based on this one, with the specified amount subtracted.
    The amount is typically [`Period`](Period.md "class in java.time") or [`Duration`](Duration.md "class in java.time") but may be
    any other type implementing the [`TemporalAmount`](temporal/TemporalAmount.md "interface in java.time.temporal") interface.

    The calculation is delegated to the amount object by calling
    [`TemporalAmount.subtractFrom(Temporal)`](temporal/TemporalAmount.md#subtractFrom(java.time.temporal.Temporal)). The amount implementation is free
    to implement the subtraction in any way it wishes, however it typically
    calls back to [`minus(long, TemporalUnit)`](#minus(long,java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit)). Consult the documentation
    of the amount implementation to determine if it can be successfully subtracted.

    Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified amount subtracted.

    This returns a `ZonedDateTime`, based on this one, with the amount
    in terms of the unit subtracted. If it is not possible to subtract the amount,
    because the unit is not supported or for some other reason, an exception is thrown.

    The calculation for date and time units differ.

    Date units operate on the local time-line.
    The period is first subtracted from the local date-time, then converted back
    to a zoned date-time using the zone ID.
    The conversion uses [`ofLocal(LocalDateTime, ZoneId, ZoneOffset)`](#ofLocal(java.time.LocalDateTime,java.time.ZoneId,java.time.ZoneOffset))

    with the offset before the subtraction.

    This method is equivalent to [`plus(long, TemporalUnit)`](#plus(long,java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit)) with the amount negated.
    See that method for a full description of how addition, and thus subtraction, works.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Specified by:
    :   `minus` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Specified by:
    :   `minus` in interface `Temporal`

    Parameters:
    :   `amountToSubtract` - the amount of the unit to subtract from the result, may be negative
    :   `unit` - the unit of the amount to subtract, not null

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on this date-time with the specified amount subtracted, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the subtraction cannot be made
    :   `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` - if the unit is not supported
    :   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs
  + ### minusYears

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") minusYears(long years)

    Returns a copy of this `ZonedDateTime` with the specified number of years subtracted.

    This operates on the local time-line,
    [`subtracting years`](LocalDateTime.md#minusYears(long)) to the local date-time.
    This is then converted back to a `ZonedDateTime`, using the zone ID
    to obtain the offset.

    When converting back to `ZonedDateTime`, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
    then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
    If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Parameters:
    :   `years` - the years to subtract, may be negative

    Returns:

    This operates on the local time-line,
    [`subtracting months`](LocalDateTime.md#minusMonths(long)) to the local date-time.
    This is then converted back to a `ZonedDateTime`, using the zone ID
    to obtain the offset.

    When converting back to `ZonedDateTime`, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
    then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
    If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Parameters:

  + ### minusWeeks

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") minusWeeks(long weeks)

    Returns a copy of this `ZonedDateTime` with the specified number of weeks subtracted.

    This operates on the local time-line,
    [`subtracting weeks`](LocalDateTime.md#minusWeeks(long)) to the local date-time.
    This is then converted back to a `ZonedDateTime`, using the zone ID
    to obtain the offset.

    When converting back to `ZonedDateTime`, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
    then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
    If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Parameters:

  + ### minusDays

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") minusDays(long days)

    Returns a copy of this `ZonedDateTime` with the specified number of days subtracted.

    This operates on the local time-line,
    [`subtracting days`](LocalDateTime.md#minusDays(long)) to the local date-time.
    This is then converted back to a `ZonedDateTime`, using the zone ID
    to obtain the offset.

    When converting back to `ZonedDateTime`, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
    then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
    If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Parameters:
    :   `days` - the days to subtract, may be negative

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on this date-time with the days subtracted, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the result exceeds the supported date range
  + ### minusHours

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") minusHours(long hours)

    Returns a copy of this `ZonedDateTime` with the specified number of hours subtracted.

    This operates on the instant time-line, such that subtracting one hour will
    always be a duration of one hour earlier.
    This may cause the local date-time to change by an amount other than one hour.
    Note that this is a different approach to that used by days, months and years,
    thus subtracting one day is not the same as adding 24 hours.

    For example, consider a time-zone, such as 'Europe/Paris', where the
    Autumn DST cutover means that the local times 02:00 to 02:59 occur twice
    changing from offset +02:00 in summer to +01:00 in winter.
    - Subtracting one hour from 03:30+01:00 will result in 02:30+01:00
      (both in winter time)- Subtracting one hour from 02:30+01:00 will result in 02:30+02:00
        (moving from winter to summer time)- Subtracting one hour from 02:30+02:00 will result in 01:30+02:00
          (both in summer time)- Subtracting three hours from 03:30+01:00 will result in 01:30+02:00
            (moving from winter to summer time)

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Parameters:
    :   `hours` - the hours to subtract, may be negative

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on this date-time with the hours subtracted, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the result exceeds the supported date range
  + ### minusMinutes

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") minusMinutes(long minutes)

    Returns a copy of this `ZonedDateTime` with the specified number of minutes subtracted.

    This operates on the instant time-line, such that subtracting one minute will
    always be a duration of one minute earlier.
    This may cause the local date-time to change by an amount other than one minute.
    Note that this is a different approach to that used by days, months and years.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Parameters:
    :   `minutes` - the minutes to subtract, may be negative

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on this date-time with the minutes subtracted, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the result exceeds the supported date range
  + ### minusSeconds

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") minusSeconds(long seconds)

    Returns a copy of this `ZonedDateTime` with the specified number of seconds subtracted.

    This operates on the instant time-line, such that subtracting one second will
    always be a duration of one second earlier.
    This may cause the local date-time to change by an amount other than one second.
    Note that this is a different approach to that used by days, months and years.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Parameters:
    :   `seconds` - the seconds to subtract, may be negative

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on this date-time with the seconds subtracted, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the result exceeds the supported date range
  + ### minusNanos

    public [ZonedDateTime](ZonedDateTime.md "class in java.time") minusNanos(long nanos)

    Returns a copy of this `ZonedDateTime` with the specified number of nanoseconds subtracted.

    This operates on the instant time-line, such that subtracting one nano will
    always be a duration of one nano earlier.
    This may cause the local date-time to change by an amount other than one nano.
    Note that this is a different approach to that used by days, months and years.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Parameters:
    :   `nanos` - the nanos to subtract, may be negative

    Returns:
    :   a `ZonedDateTime` based on this date-time with the nanoseconds subtracted, not null

    Throws:

  + ### query

    public <R> R query([TemporalQuery](temporal/TemporalQuery.md "interface in java.time.temporal")<R> query)

    Queries this date-time using the specified query.

    This queries this date-time using the specified query strategy object.
    The `TemporalQuery` object defines the logic to be used to
    obtain the result. Read the documentation of the query to understand
    what the result of this method will be.

    The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
    [`TemporalQuery.queryFrom(TemporalAccessor)`](temporal/TemporalQuery.md#queryFrom(java.time.temporal.TemporalAccessor)) method on the
    specified query passing `this` as the argument.

    Specified by:
    :   `query` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Specified by:
    :   `query` in interface `TemporalAccessor`

    Type Parameters:
    :   `R` - the type of the result

    Parameters:
    :   `query` - the query to invoke, not null

    Returns:
    :   the query result, null may be returned (defined by the query)

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if unable to query (defined by the query)
    :   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs (defined by the query)
  + ### until

    public long until([Temporal](temporal/Temporal.md "interface in java.time.temporal") endExclusive,
    [TemporalUnit](temporal/TemporalUnit.md "interface in java.time.temporal") unit)

    Calculates the amount of time until another date-time in terms of the specified unit.

    This calculates the amount of time between two `ZonedDateTime`
    objects in terms of a single `TemporalUnit`.
    The start and end points are `this` and the specified date-time.
    The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
    For example, the amount in days between two date-times can be calculated
    using `startDateTime.until(endDateTime, DAYS)`.

    The `Temporal` passed to this method is converted to a
    `ZonedDateTime` using [`from(TemporalAccessor)`](#from(java.time.temporal.TemporalAccessor)).
    If the time-zone differs between the two zoned date-times, the specified
    end date-time is normalized to have the same zone as this date-time.

    The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
    complete units between the two date-times.
    For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15T00:00Z and 2012-08-14T23:59Z
    will only be one month as it is one minute short of two months.

    There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
    The first is to invoke this method.
    The second is to use [`TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)`](temporal/TemporalUnit.md#between(java.time.temporal.Temporal,java.time.temporal.Temporal)):

    ```
       // these two lines are equivalent
       amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
       amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
    ```

    The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.

    The calculation is implemented in this method for [`ChronoUnit`](temporal/ChronoUnit.md "enum class in java.time.temporal").
    The units `NANOS`, `MICROS`, `MILLIS`, `SECONDS`,
    `MINUTES`, `HOURS` and `HALF_DAYS`, `DAYS`,
    `WEEKS`, `MONTHS`, `YEARS`, `DECADES`,
    `CENTURIES`, `MILLENNIA` and `ERAS` are supported.
    Other `ChronoUnit` values will throw an exception.

    The calculation for date and time units differ.

    Date units operate on the local time-line, using the local date-time.
    For example, the period from noon on day 1 to noon the following day
    in days will always be counted as exactly one day, irrespective of whether
    there was a daylight savings change or not.

    Time units operate on the instant time-line.
    The calculation effectively converts both zoned date-times to instants
    and then calculates the period between the instants.
    For example, the period from noon on day 1 to noon the following day
    in hours may be 23, 24 or 25 hours (or some other amount) depending on
    whether there was a daylight savings change or not.

    If the unit is not a `ChronoUnit`, then the result of this method
    is obtained by invoking `TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)`
    passing `this` as the first argument and the converted input temporal
    as the second argument.

    This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

    Specified by:
    :   `until` in interface `Temporal`

    Parameters:
    :   `endExclusive` - the end date, exclusive, which is converted to a `ZonedDateTime`, not null
    :   `unit` - the unit to measure the amount in, not null

    Returns:
    :   the amount of time between this date-time and the end date-time

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
        temporal cannot be converted to a `ZonedDateTime`
    :   `UnsupportedTemporalTypeException` - if the unit is not supported
    :   `ArithmeticException` - if numeric overflow occurs
  + ### format

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") format([DateTimeFormatter](format/DateTimeFormatter.md "class in java.time.format") formatter)

    Formats this date-time using the specified formatter.

    This date-time will be passed to the formatter to produce a string.

    Specified by:
    :   `format` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Parameters:
    :   `formatter` - the formatter to use, not null

    Returns:
    :   the formatted date-time string, not null

    Throws:
    :   `DateTimeException` - if an error occurs during printing
  + ### toOffsetDateTime

    public [OffsetDateTime](OffsetDateTime.md "class in java.time") toOffsetDateTime()

    Converts this date-time to an `OffsetDateTime`.

    This creates an offset date-time using the local date-time and offset.
    The zone ID is ignored.

    Returns:
    :   an offset date-time representing the same local date-time and offset, not null
  + ### equals

    public boolean equals([Object](../lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") obj)

    Checks if this date-time is equal to another date-time.

    The comparison is based on the offset date-time and the zone.
    Only objects of type `ZonedDateTime` are compared, other types return false.

    Specified by:
    :   `equals` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Overrides:
    :   `equals` in class `Object`

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - the object to check, null returns false

    Returns:
    :   true if this is equal to the other date-time

  + ### toString

    public [String](../lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Outputs this date-time as a `String`, such as
    `2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00[Europe/Paris]`.

    The format consists of the `LocalDateTime` followed by the `ZoneOffset`.
    If the `ZoneId` is not the same as the offset, then the ID is output.
    The output is compatible with ISO-8601 if the offset and ID are the same,
    and the seconds in the offset are zero.

    Specified by:
    :   `toString` in interface `ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>`

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   a string representation of this date-time, not null
