# Interface XAResource

---

public interface XAResource

The XAResource interface is a Java mapping of the industry standard
XA interface based on the X/Open CAE Specification (Distributed
Transaction Processing: The XA Specification).

The XA interface defines the contract between a Resource Manager
and a Transaction Manager in a distributed transaction processing
(DTP) environment. A JDBC driver or a JMS provider implements
this interface to support the association between a global transaction
and a database or message service connection.

The XAResource interface can be supported by any transactional
resource that is intended to be used by application programs in an
environment where transactions are controlled by an external
transaction manager. An example of such a resource is a database
management system. An application may access data through multiple
database connections. Each database connection is enlisted with
the transaction manager as a transactional resource. The transaction
manager obtains an XAResource for each connection participating
in a global transaction. The transaction manager uses the
`start` method
to associate the global transaction with the resource, and it uses the
`end` method to disassociate the transaction from
the resource. The resource
manager is responsible for associating the global transaction to all
work performed on its data between the start and end method invocations.

At transaction commit time, the resource managers are informed by
the transaction manager to prepare, commit, or rollback a transaction
according to the two-phase commit protocol.

    Commits the global transaction specified by xid.

    Parameters:
    :   `xid` - A global transaction identifier
    :   `onePhase` - If true, the resource manager should use a one-phase
        commit protocol to commit the work done on behalf of xid.

  + ### end

    void end([Xid](Xid.md "interface in javax.transaction.xa") xid,
    int flags)
    throws [XAException](XAException.md "class in javax.transaction.xa")

    Ends the work performed on behalf of a transaction branch.
    The resource manager disassociates the XA resource from the
    transaction branch specified and lets the transaction
    complete.

    If TMSUSPEND is specified in the flags, the transaction branch
    is temporarily suspended in an incomplete state. The transaction
    context is in a suspended state and must be resumed via the
    `start` method with TMRESUME specified.

    If TMFAIL is specified, the portion of work has failed.
    The resource manager may mark the transaction as rollback-only

    If TMSUCCESS is specified, the portion of work has completed
    successfully.

    Parameters:
    :   `xid` - A global transaction identifier that is the same as
        the identifier used previously in the `start` method.
    :   `flags` - One of TMSUCCESS, TMFAIL, or TMSUSPEND.

    Throws:
    :   `XAException` - An error has occurred. Possible XAException
        values are XAER\_RMERR, XAER\_RMFAILED, XAER\_NOTA, XAER\_INVAL,
        XAER\_PROTO, or XA\_RB\*.
  + ### forget

    throws [XAException](XAException.md "class in javax.transaction.xa")

    Tells the resource manager to forget about a heuristically
    completed transaction branch.

    Parameters:
    :   `xid` - A global transaction identifier.

    int getTransactionTimeout()
    throws [XAException](XAException.md "class in javax.transaction.xa")

    Obtains the current transaction timeout value set for this
    XAResource instance. If `XAResource.setTransactionTimeout`
    was not used prior to invoking this method, the return value
    is the default timeout set for the resource manager; otherwise,
    the value used in the previous `setTransactionTimeout`
    call is returned.

    Returns:
    :   the transaction timeout value in seconds.

    Throws:
    :   `XAException` - An error has occurred. Possible exception
        values are XAER\_RMERR and XAER\_RMFAIL.
  + ### isSameRM

    boolean isSameRM([XAResource](XAResource.md "interface in javax.transaction.xa") xares)
    throws [XAException](XAException.md "class in javax.transaction.xa")

    This method is called to determine if the resource manager
    instance represented by the target object is the same as the
    resource manager instance represented by the parameter *xares*.

    Parameters:
    :   `xares` - An XAResource object whose resource manager instance
        is to be compared with the resource manager instance of the
        target object.

    Returns:
    :   *true* if it's the same RM instance; otherwise
        *false*.

    Throws:
    :   `XAException` - An error has occurred. Possible exception
        values are XAER\_RMERR and XAER\_RMFAIL.
  + ### prepare

    int prepare([Xid](Xid.md "interface in javax.transaction.xa") xid)
    throws [XAException](XAException.md "class in javax.transaction.xa")

    Ask the resource manager to prepare for a transaction commit
    of the transaction specified in xid.

    Parameters:
    :   `xid` - A global transaction identifier.

    Returns:
    :   A value indicating the resource manager's vote on the
        outcome of the transaction. The possible values are: XA\_RDONLY
        or XA\_OK. If the resource manager wants to roll back the
        transaction, it should do so by raising an appropriate XAException
        in the prepare method.

    Throws:
    :   `XAException` - An error has occurred. Possible exception
        values are: XA\_RB\*, XAER\_RMERR, XAER\_RMFAIL, XAER\_NOTA, XAER\_INVAL,
        or XAER\_PROTO.
  + ### recover

    [Xid](Xid.md "interface in javax.transaction.xa")[] recover(int flag)
    throws [XAException](XAException.md "class in javax.transaction.xa")

    Obtains a list of prepared transaction branches from a resource
    manager. The transaction manager calls this method during recovery
    to obtain the list of transaction branches that are currently in
    prepared or heuristically completed states.

    Parameters:
    :   `flag` - One of TMSTARTRSCAN, TMENDRSCAN, TMNOFLAGS. TMNOFLAGS
        must be used when no other flags are set in the parameter.

    Returns:
    :   The resource manager returns zero or more XIDs of the
        transaction branches that are currently in a prepared or
        heuristically completed state. If an error occurs during the
        operation, the resource manager should throw the appropriate
        XAException.

    Throws:
    :   `XAException` - An error has occurred. Possible values are
        XAER\_RMERR, XAER\_RMFAIL, XAER\_INVAL, and XAER\_PROTO.
  + ### rollback

    void rollback([Xid](Xid.md "interface in javax.transaction.xa") xid)
    throws [XAException](XAException.md "class in javax.transaction.xa")

    Informs the resource manager to roll back work done on behalf
    of a transaction branch.

    Parameters:
    :   `xid` - A global transaction identifier.

    Throws:
    :   `XAException` - An error has occurred.
  + ### setTransactionTimeout

    boolean setTransactionTimeout(int seconds)
    throws [XAException](XAException.md "class in javax.transaction.xa")

    Sets the current transaction timeout value for this `XAResource`
    instance. Once set, this timeout value is effective until
    `setTransactionTimeout` is invoked again with a different
    value. To reset the timeout value to the default value used by the resource
    manager, set the value to zero.
    If the timeout operation is performed successfully, the method returns
    *true*; otherwise *false*. If a resource manager does not
    support explicitly setting the transaction timeout value, this method
    returns *false*.

    Parameters:
    :   `seconds` - The transaction timeout value in seconds.

    Returns:
    :   *true* if the transaction timeout value is set successfully;
        otherwise *false*.

    Throws:
    :   `XAException` - An error has occurred. Possible exception values
        are XAER\_RMERR, XAER\_RMFAIL, or XAER\_INVAL.
  + ### start

    void start([Xid](Xid.md "interface in javax.transaction.xa") xid,
    int flags)
    throws [XAException](XAException.md "class in javax.transaction.xa")

    Starts work on behalf of a transaction branch specified in
    `xid`.
    If TMJOIN is specified, the start applies to joining a transaction
    previously seen by the resource manager. If TMRESUME is specified,
    the start applies to resuming a suspended transaction specified in the
    parameter `xid`.
    If neither TMJOIN nor TMRESUME is specified and the transaction
    specified by `xid` has previously been seen by the resource
    manager, the resource manager throws the XAException exception with
    XAER\_DUPID error code.

    Parameters:
    :   `xid` - A global transaction identifier to be associated
        with the resource.
    :   `flags` - One of TMNOFLAGS, TMJOIN, or TMRESUME.

    Throws:
    :   `XAException` - An error has occurred. Possible exceptions
        are XA\_RB\*, XAER\_RMERR, XAER\_RMFAIL, XAER\_DUPID, XAER\_OUTSIDE,
        XAER\_NOTA, XAER\_INVAL, or XAER\_PROTO.
