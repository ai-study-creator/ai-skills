# Interface LdapContext

All Superinterfaces:
:   `Context`, `DirContext`

All Known Implementing Classes:
:   `InitialLdapContext`

---

public interface LdapContext
extends [DirContext](../directory/DirContext.md "interface in javax.naming.directory")

This interface represents a context in which you can perform
operations with LDAPv3-style controls and perform LDAPv3-style
extended operations.
For applications that do not require such controls or extended
operations, the more generic `javax.naming.directory.DirContext`
should be used instead.

## Usage Details About Controls

This interface provides support for LDAP v3 controls.
At a high level, this support allows a user
program to set request controls for LDAP operations that are executed
in the course of the user program's invocation of
`Context`/`DirContext`
methods, and read response controls resulting from LDAP operations.
At the implementation level, there are some details that developers of
both the user program and service providers need to understand in order
to correctly use request and response controls.

## Request Controls

There are two types of request controls:

* Request controls that affect how a connection is created* Request controls that affect context methods

The former is used whenever a connection needs to be established or
re-established with an LDAP server. The latter is used when all other
LDAP operations are sent to the LDAP server. The reason why a
distinction between these two types of request controls is necessary
is because JNDI is a high-level API that does not deal directly with
connections. It is the job of service providers to do any necessary
connection management. Consequently, a single
connection may be shared by multiple context instances, and a service provider
is free to use its own algorithms to conserve connection and network
usage. Thus, when a method is invoked on the context instance, the service
provider might need to do some connection management in addition to
performing the corresponding LDAP operations. For connection management,
it uses the *connection request controls*, while for the normal
LDAP operations, it uses the *context request controls*.

Unless explicitly qualified, the term "request controls" refers to
context request controls.

### Context Request Controls

There are two ways in which a context instance gets its request controls:

1. `ldapContext.newInstance(reqCtls)`- `ldapContext.setRequestControls(reqCtls)`

where `ldapContext` is an instance of `LdapContext`.
Specifying `null` or an empty array for `reqCtls`
means no request controls.
`newInstance()` creates a new instance of a context using
`reqCtls`, while `setRequestControls()`
updates an existing context instance's request controls to `reqCtls`.

Unlike environment properties, request controls of a context instance
*are not inherited* by context instances that are derived from
it. Derived context instances have `null` as their context
request controls. You must set the request controls of a derived context
instance explicitly using `setRequestControls()`.

A context instance's request controls are retrieved using
the method `getRequestControls()`.

### Connection Request Controls

There are three ways in which connection request controls are set:

1. `new InitialLdapContext(env, connCtls)`- `refException.getReferralContext(env, connCtls)`- `ldapContext.reconnect(connCtls);`

where `refException` is an instance of
`LdapReferralException`, and `ldapContext` is an
instance of `LdapContext`.
Specifying `null` or an empty array for `connCtls`
means no connection request controls.

Like environment properties, connection request controls of a context
*are inherited* by contexts that are derived from it.
Typically, you initialize the connection request controls using the
`InitialLdapContext` constructor or
`LdapReferralContext.getReferralContext()`. These connection
request controls are inherited by contexts that share the same
connection--that is, contexts derived from the initial or referral
contexts.

Use `reconnect()` to change the connection request controls of
a context.
Invoking `ldapContext.reconnect()` affects only the
connection used by `ldapContext` and any new contexts instances that are
derived form `ldapContext`. Contexts that previously shared the
connection with `ldapContext` remain unchanged. That is, a context's
connection request controls must be explicitly changed and is not
affected by changes to another context's connection request
controls.

A context instance's connection request controls are retrieved using
the method `getConnectControls()`.

### Service Provider Requirements

A service provider supports connection and context request controls
in the following ways. Context request controls must be associated on
a per context instance basis while connection request controls must be
associated on a per connection instance basis. The service provider
must look for the connection request controls in the environment
property "java.naming.ldap.control.connect" and pass this environment
property on to context instances that it creates.

## Response Controls

The method `LdapContext.getResponseControls()` is used to
retrieve the response controls generated by LDAP operations executed
as the result of invoking a `Context`/`DirContext`
operation. The result is all of the responses controls generated
by the underlying LDAP operations, including any implicit reconnection.
To get only the reconnection response controls,
use `reconnect()` followed by `getResponseControls()`.

## Parameters

A `Control[]` array
passed as a parameter to any method is owned by the caller.
The service provider will not modify the array or keep a reference to it,
although it may keep references to the individual `Control` objects
in the array.
A `Control[]` array returned by any method is immutable, and may
not subsequently be modified by either the caller or the service provider.

  + ### extendedOperation

    [ExtendedResponse](ExtendedResponse.md "interface in javax.naming.ldap") extendedOperation([ExtendedRequest](ExtendedRequest.md "interface in javax.naming.ldap") request)
    throws [NamingException](../NamingException.md "class in javax.naming")

    Performs an extended operation.
    This method is used to support LDAPv3 extended operations.

    Parameters:
    :   `request` - The non-null request to be performed.

    Returns:
    :   The possibly null response of the operation. null means
        the operation did not generate any response.

    Throws:
    :   `NamingException` - If an error occurred while performing the
        extended operation.
  + ### newInstance

    [LdapContext](LdapContext.md "interface in javax.naming.ldap") newInstance([Control](Control.md "interface in javax.naming.ldap")[] requestControls)
    throws [NamingException](../NamingException.md "class in javax.naming")

    Creates a new instance of this context initialized using request controls.
    This method is a convenience method for creating a new instance
    of this context for the purposes of multithreaded access.
    For example, if multiple threads want to use different context
    request controls,
    each thread may use this method to get its own copy of this context
    and set/get context request controls without having to synchronize with other
    threads.

    The new context has the same environment properties and connection
    request controls as this context. See the class description for details.
    Implementations might also allow this context and the new context
    to share the same network connection or other resources if doing
    so does not impede the independence of either context.

    Parameters:
    :   `requestControls` - The possibly null request controls
        to use for the new context.
        If null, the context is initialized with no request controls.

    Returns:
    :   A non-null `LdapContext` instance.

    Throws:
    :   `NamingException` - If an error occurred while creating
        the new instance.

    :   - [`InitialLdapContext`](InitialLdapContext.md "class in javax.naming.ldap")
  + ### reconnect

    void reconnect([Control](Control.md "interface in javax.naming.ldap")[] connCtls)
    throws [NamingException](../NamingException.md "class in javax.naming")

    Reconnects to the LDAP server using the supplied controls and
    this context's environment.

    This method is a way to explicitly initiate an LDAP "bind" operation.
    For example, you can use this method to set request controls for
    the LDAP "bind" operation, or to explicitly connect to the server
    to get response controls returned by the LDAP "bind" operation.

    This method sets this context's `connCtls`
    to be its new connection request controls. This context's
    context request controls are not affected.
    After this method has been invoked, any subsequent
    implicit reconnections will be done using `connCtls`.
    `connCtls` are also used as
    connection request controls for new context instances derived from this
    context.
    These connection request controls are not
    affected by `setRequestControls()`.

    Service provider implementors should read the "Service Provider" section
    in the class description for implementation details.

    Parameters:
    :   `connCtls` - The possibly null controls to use. If null, no
        controls are used.

    Throws:
    :   `NamingException` - If an error occurred while reconnecting.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getConnectControls()`](#getConnectControls())
        - [`newInstance(javax.naming.ldap.Control[])`](#newInstance(javax.naming.ldap.Control%5B%5D))
  + ### getConnectControls

    [Control](Control.md "interface in javax.naming.ldap")[] getConnectControls()
    throws [NamingException](../NamingException.md "class in javax.naming")

    Retrieves the connection request controls in effect for this context.
    The controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are
    immutable. Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the
    caller.

    Returns:
    :   A possibly-null array of controls. null means no connect controls
        have been set for this context.

    Throws:
    :   `NamingException` - If an error occurred while getting the request
        controls.
  + ### setRequestControls

    void setRequestControls([Control](Control.md "interface in javax.naming.ldap")[] requestControls)
    throws [NamingException](../NamingException.md "class in javax.naming")

    Sets the request controls for methods subsequently
    invoked on this context.
    The request controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are
    immutable. Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the
    caller.

    This removes any previous request controls and adds
    `requestControls`
    for use by subsequent methods invoked on this context.
    This method does not affect this context's connection request controls.

    Note that `requestControls` will be in effect until the next
    invocation of `setRequestControls()`. You need to explicitly
    invoke `setRequestControls()` with `null` or an empty
    array to clear the controls if you don't want them to affect the
    context methods any more.
    To check what request controls are in effect for this context, use
    `getRequestControls()`.

    Parameters:
    :   `requestControls` - The possibly null controls to use. If null, no
        controls are used.

    Throws:
    :   `NamingException` - If an error occurred while setting the
        request controls.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getRequestControls()`](#getRequestControls())
  + ### getRequestControls

    [Control](Control.md "interface in javax.naming.ldap")[] getRequestControls()
    throws [NamingException](../NamingException.md "class in javax.naming")

    Retrieves the request controls in effect for this context.
    The request controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are
    immutable. Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the
    caller.

    Returns:
    :   A possibly-null array of controls. null means no request controls
        have been set for this context.

    Throws:
    :   `NamingException` - If an error occurred while getting the request
        controls.

    See Also:
    :   - [`setRequestControls(javax.naming.ldap.Control[])`](#setRequestControls(javax.naming.ldap.Control%5B%5D))
  + ### getResponseControls

    [Control](Control.md "interface in javax.naming.ldap")[] getResponseControls()
    throws [NamingException](../NamingException.md "class in javax.naming")

    Retrieves the response controls produced as a result of the last
    method invoked on this context.
    The response controls are owned by the JNDI implementation and are
    immutable. Neither the array nor the controls may be modified by the
    caller.

    These response controls might have been generated by a successful or
    failed operation.

    When a context method that may return response controls is invoked,
    response controls from the previous method invocation are cleared.
    `getResponseControls()` returns all of the response controls
    generated by LDAP operations used by the context method in the order
    received from the LDAP server.
    Invoking `getResponseControls()` does not
    clear the response controls. You can call it many times (and get
    back the same controls) until the next context method that may return
    controls is invoked.

    Returns:
    :   A possibly null array of controls. If null, the previous
        method invoked on this context did not produce any controls.

    Throws:
    :   `NamingException` - If an error occurred while getting the response
        controls.
