# Interface ObjectFactoryBuilder

---

public interface ObjectFactoryBuilder

This interface represents a builder that creates object factories.

The JNDI framework allows for object implementations to
be loaded in dynamically via *object factories*.
For example, when looking up a printer bound in the name space,
if the print service binds printer names to References, the printer
Reference could be used to create a printer object, so that
the caller of lookup can directly operate on the printer object
after the lookup. An ObjectFactory is responsible for creating
objects of a specific type. JNDI uses a default policy for using
and loading object factories. You can override this default policy
by calling `NamingManager.setObjectFactoryBuilder()` with an ObjectFactoryBuilder,
which contains the program-defined way of creating/loading
object factories.
Any `ObjectFactoryBuilder` implementation must implement this
interface that for creating object factories.

  `ObjectFactory`

  `createObjectFactory(Object obj,

  Creates a new object factory using the environment supplied.

* ## Method Details

  + ### createObjectFactory

    [ObjectFactory](ObjectFactory.md "interface in javax.naming.spi") createObjectFactory([Object](../../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") obj,
    [Hashtable](../../../../java.base/java/util/Hashtable.md "class in java.util")<?,?> environment)
    throws [NamingException](../NamingException.md "class in javax.naming")

    Creates a new object factory using the environment supplied.

    The environment parameter is owned by the caller.
    The implementation will not modify the object or keep a reference
    to it, although it may keep a reference to a clone or copy.

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - The possibly null object for which to create a factory.
    :   `environment` - Environment to use when creating the factory.
        Can be null.

    Returns:
    :   A non-null new instance of an ObjectFactory.

    Throws:
    :   `NamingException` - If an object factory cannot be created.
