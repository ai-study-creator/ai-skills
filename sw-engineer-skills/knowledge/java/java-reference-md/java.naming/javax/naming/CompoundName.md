public class CompoundName
extends [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang")
implements [Name](Name.md "interface in javax.naming")

This class represents a compound name -- a name from
a hierarchical name space.
Each component in a compound name is an atomic name.

The components of a compound name are numbered. The indexes of a
compound name with N components range from 0 up to, but not including, N.
This range may be written as [0,N).
The most significant component is at index 0.
An empty compound name has no components.

## Compound Name Syntax

The syntax of a compound name is specified using a set of properties:

jndi.syntax.direction: Direction for parsing ("right\_to\_left", "left\_to\_right", "flat"). If unspecified, defaults to "flat", which means the namespace is flat with no hierarchical structure. jndi.syntax.separator: Separator between atomic name components. Required unless direction is "flat". jndi.syntax.ignorecase: If present, "true" means ignore the case when comparing name components. If its value is not "true", or if the property is not present, case is considered when comparing name components. jndi.syntax.escape: If present, specifies the escape string for overriding separator, escapes and quotes. jndi.syntax.beginquote: If present, specifies the string delimiting start of a quoted string. jndi.syntax.endquote: String delimiting end of quoted string. If present, specifies the string delimiting the end of a quoted string. If not present, use syntax.beginquote as end quote. jndi.syntax.beginquote2: Alternative set of begin/end quotes. jndi.syntax.endquote2: Alternative set of begin/end quotes. jndi.syntax.trimblanks: If present, "true" means trim any leading and trailing whitespaces in a name component for comparison purposes. If its value is not "true", or if the property is not present, blanks are significant. jndi.syntax.separator.ava: If present, specifies the string that separates attribute-value-assertions when specifying multiple attribute/value pairs. (e.g. "," in age=65,gender=male). jndi.syntax.separator.typeval: If present, specifies the string that separates attribute from value (e.g. "=" in "age=65")

These properties are interpreted according to the following rules:

1. In a string without quotes or escapes, any instance of the
   separator delimits two atomic names. Each atomic name is referred
   to as a *component*.- A separator, quote or escape is escaped if preceded immediately
     (on the left) by the escape.- If there are two sets of quotes, a specific begin-quote must be matched
       by its corresponding end-quote.- A non-escaped begin-quote which precedes a component must be
         matched by a non-escaped end-quote at the end of the component.
         A component thus quoted is referred to as a
         *quoted component*. It is parsed by
         removing the being- and end- quotes, and by treating the intervening
         characters as ordinary characters unless one of the rules involving
         quoted components listed below applies.- Quotes embedded in non-quoted components are treated as ordinary strings
           and need not be matched.- A separator that is escaped or appears between non-escaped
             quotes is treated as an ordinary string and not a separator.- An escape string within a quoted component acts as an escape only when
               followed by the corresponding end-quote string.
               This can be used to embed an escaped quote within a quoted component.- An escaped escape string is not treated as an escape string.- An escape string that does not precede a meta string (quotes or separator)
                   and is not at the end of a component is treated as an ordinary string.- A leading separator (the compound name string begins with
                     a separator) denotes a leading empty atomic component (consisting
                     of an empty string).
                     A trailing separator (the compound name string ends with
                     a separator) denotes a trailing empty atomic component.
                     Adjacent separators denote an empty atomic component.

The string form of the compound name follows the syntax described above.
When the components of the compound name are turned into their
string representation, the reserved syntax rules described above are
applied (e.g. embedded separators are escaped or quoted)
so that when the same string is parsed, it will yield the same components
of the original compound name.

## Multithreaded Access

A `CompoundName` instance is not synchronized against concurrent
multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify a
`CompoundName` should lock the object.

  + ### CompoundName

    protected CompoundName([Enumeration](../../../java.base/java/util/Enumeration.md "interface in java.util")<[String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang")> comps,
    [Properties](../../../java.base/java/util/Properties.md "class in java.util") syntax)

    Constructs a new compound name instance using the components
    specified in comps and syntax. This protected method is intended
    to be used by subclasses of CompoundName when they override
    methods such as clone(), getPrefix(), getSuffix().

    Parameters:
    :   `comps` - A non-null enumeration of the components to add.
        Each element of the enumeration is of class String.
        The enumeration will be consumed to extract its
        elements.
    :   `syntax` - A non-null properties that specify the syntax of
        this compound name. See class description for
        contents of properties.
  + ### CompoundName

    public CompoundName([String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") n,
    [Properties](../../../java.base/java/util/Properties.md "class in java.util") syntax)

        by `syntax`.
* ## Method Details

  + ### toString

    public [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Generates the string representation of this compound name, using
    the syntax rules of the compound name. The syntax rules
    are described in the class description.
    An empty component is represented by an empty string.
    The string representation thus generated can be passed to
    the CompoundName constructor with the same syntax properties
    to create a new equivalent compound name.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   A non-null string representation of this compound name.
  + ### equals

    public boolean equals([Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") obj)

    Determines whether obj is syntactically equal to this compound name.
    If obj is null or not a CompoundName, false is returned.
    Two compound names are equal if each component in one is "equal"
    to the corresponding component in the other.

    Equality is also defined in terms of the syntax of this compound name.
    The default implementation of CompoundName uses the syntax properties
    jndi.syntax.ignorecase and jndi.syntax.trimblanks when comparing
    two components for equality. If case is ignored, two strings
    with the same sequence of characters but with different cases
    are considered equal. If blanks are being trimmed, leading and trailing
    blanks are ignored for the purpose of the comparison.

    Both compound names must have the same number of components.

    Implementation note: Currently the syntax properties of the two compound
    names are not compared for equality. They might be in the future.

    Overrides:
    :   `equals` in class `Object`

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - The possibly null object to compare against.

    Returns:
    :   true if obj is equal to this compound name, false otherwise.

    See Also:
    :   - [`compareTo(java.lang.Object obj)`](#compareTo(java.lang.Object))
  + ### hashCode

    public int hashCode()

    Computes the hash code of this compound name.
    The hash code is the sum of the hash codes of the "canonicalized"
    forms of individual components of this compound name.
    Each component is "canonicalized" according to the
    compound name's syntax before its hash code is computed.
    For a case-insensitive name, for example, the uppercased form of
    a name has the same hash code as its lowercased equivalent.

    Overrides:
    :   `hashCode` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   An int representing the hash code of this name.

    See Also:
    :   - [`Object.equals(java.lang.Object)`](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md#equals(java.lang.Object))
        - [`System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)`](../../../java.base/java/lang/System.md#identityHashCode(java.lang.Object))
  + ### clone

    public [Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") clone()

    Creates a copy of this compound name.
    Changes to the components of this compound name won't
    affect the new copy and vice versa.
    The clone and this compound name share the same syntax.

    Specified by:
    :   `clone` in interface `Name`

    Overrides:
    :   `clone` in class `Object`

    Returns:
    :   A non-null copy of this compound name.

    See Also:
    :   - [`Cloneable`](../../../java.base/java/lang/Cloneable.md "interface in java.lang")
  + ### compareTo

    public int compareTo([Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") obj)

    Compares this CompoundName with the specified Object for order.
    Returns a
    negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this Name is less
    than, equal to, or greater than the given Object.

    If obj is null or not an instance of CompoundName, ClassCastException
    is thrown.

    See equals() for what it means for two compound names to be equal.
    If two compound names are equal, 0 is returned.

    Ordering of compound names depend on the syntax of the compound name.
    By default, they follow lexicographical rules for string comparison
    with the extension that this applies to all the components in the
    compound name and that comparison of individual components is
    affected by the jndi.syntax.ignorecase and jndi.syntax.trimblanks
    properties, identical to how they affect equals().
    If this compound name is "lexicographically" lesser than obj,
    a negative number is returned.
    If this compound name is "lexicographically" greater than obj,
    a positive number is returned.

    Implementation note: Currently the syntax properties of the two compound
    names are not compared when checking order. They might be in the future.

    Specified by:
    :   `compareTo` in interface `Comparable<Object>`

    Specified by:
    :   `compareTo` in interface `Name`

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - The non-null object to compare against.

    Returns:
    :   a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this Name
        is less than, equal to, or greater than the given Object.
