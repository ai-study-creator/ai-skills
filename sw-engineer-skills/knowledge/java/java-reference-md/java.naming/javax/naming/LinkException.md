public class LinkException
extends [NamingException](NamingException.md "class in javax.naming")

This exception is used to describe problems encountered while resolving links.
Additional information is added to the base NamingException for pinpointing
the problem with the link.

Analogously to how NamingException captures name resolution information,
LinkException captures "link"-name resolution information pinpointing
the problem encountered while resolving a link. All these fields may
be null.

* Link Resolved Name. Portion of link name that has been resolved.* Link Resolved Object. Object to which resolution of link name proceeded.* Link Remaining Name. Portion of link name that has not been resolved.* Link Explanation. Detail explaining why link resolution failed.

A LinkException instance is not synchronized against concurrent
multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify
a single LinkException instance should lock the object.

Since:
:   1.3

    successfully.

    Returns:
    :   The part of the link name that was resolved successfully.
        It is a composite name. It can be null, which means

    Retrieves the explanation associated with the problem encountered
    when resolving a link.

    Returns:
    :   The possibly null detail string explaining more about the problem
        with resolving a link.
        If null, it means there is no
        link detail message for this exception.

    See Also:
    :   - [`setLinkExplanation(java.lang.String)`](#setLinkExplanation(java.lang.String))
  + ### setLinkExplanation

    public void setLinkExplanation([String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") msg)

    Sets the explanation associated with the problem encountered
    when resolving a link.

    Parameters:
    :   `msg` - The possibly null detail string explaining more about the problem
        with resolving a link. If null, it means no detail will be recorded.

  + ### setLinkResolvedName

    public void setLinkResolvedName([Name](Name.md "interface in javax.naming") name)

    Sets the resolved link name field of this exception.

    `name` is a composite name. If the intent is to set
    this field using a compound name or string, you must
    "stringify" the compound name, and create a composite
    name with a single component using the string. You can then
    invoke this method using the resulting composite name.

    A copy of `name` is made and stored.
    Subsequent changes to `name` do not
    affect the copy in this NamingException and vice versa.

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - The name to set resolved link name to. This can be null.
        If null, it sets the link resolved name field to null.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getLinkResolvedName()`](#getLinkResolvedName())
  + ### setLinkRemainingName

    public void setLinkRemainingName([Name](Name.md "interface in javax.naming") name)

    Sets the remaining link name field of this exception.

    `name` is a composite name. If the intent is to set
    this field using a compound name or string, you must
    "stringify" the compound name, and create a composite
    name with a single component using the string. You can then
    invoke this method using the resulting composite name.

    A copy of `name` is made and stored.
    Subsequent changes to `name` do not
    affect the copy in this NamingException and vice versa.

    Parameters:
    :   `name` - The name to set remaining link name to. This can be null.
        If null, it sets the remaining name field to null.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getLinkRemainingName()`](#getLinkRemainingName())
  + ### setLinkResolvedObj

    public void setLinkResolvedObj([Object](../../../java.base/java/lang/Object.md "class in java.lang") obj)

    Sets the link resolved object field of this exception.
    This indicates the last successfully resolved object of link name.

    Parameters:
    :   `obj` - The object to set link resolved object to. This can be null.
        If null, the link resolved object field is set to null.

    See Also:
    :   - [`getLinkResolvedObj()`](#getLinkResolvedObj())
  + ### toString

    public [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString()

    Generates the string representation of this exception.
    This string consists of the NamingException information plus
    the link's remaining name.
    This string is used for debugging and not meant to be interpreted
    programmatically.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `NamingException`

    Returns:
    :   The non-null string representation of this link exception.
  + ### toString

    public [String](../../../java.base/java/lang/String.md "class in java.lang") toString(boolean detail)

    Generates the string representation of this exception.
    This string consists of the NamingException information plus
    the additional information of resolving the link.
    If 'detail' is true, the string also contains information on
    the link resolved object. If false, this method is the same
    as the form of toString() that accepts no parameters.
    This string is used for debugging and not meant to be interpreted
    programmatically.

    Overrides:
    :   `toString` in class `NamingException`

    Parameters:
    :   `detail` - If true, add information about the link resolved
        object.

    Returns:
    :   The non-null string representation of this link exception.
